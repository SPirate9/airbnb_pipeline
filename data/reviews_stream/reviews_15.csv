3024336,35194064,2015-06-16,8704541,Theresa,"My mother and sister and I travelled to Seattle for my son's graduation from Seattle U.   We stayed at Camille and Gaelen's airbnb which was PERFECT!   It was just one block to the University where my graduating son and his brother stayed in the dorms.   The place is just adorable!   So comfortable, and unique!   We waked to everything - wonderful restaurants, Trader Joe's.  "
3024336,35798480,2015-06-22,32136123,Jessica,"Camille was a great host! My friends and I really enjoyed our stay and it was walking distance to a lot of eateries/bars. It wasn't too far from all the touristy spots either. Camille also provided us with all the necessary info we needed to get around town and if we had any questions, she was just a text away. Definitely recommend staying at her place when visiting Seattle."
3024336,36578792,2015-06-29,22207214,Oliver,"Camille has a lovely home in a perfect location for seeing and getting around Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle.  Parking was even available across the road.  The apartment is very spacious and has a great kitchen and bathroom!  Camille is very friendly, the check-in was effortless and we had everything we needed and more.  Thanks also for all the leaflets and tips for things to do nearby! :)
"
3024336,37456828,2015-07-07,6140207,Roger,"Camille was very helpful and friendly. This was my first time using airbnb.com for a stay, she made it so easy and stress free for me. The condo is extremely clean and nicely furnished. The full kitchen allowed us to shop at the neighborhood safeway for basic groceries to cook and enjoy homemade meals. The bed downstairs in the living room was so comfortable. The location for us was perfect! We walked to local restaurants and bars each day and all the ""tourist"" stuff we wanted to see was a quick 10-15 min drive. We enjoyed our stay very much."
3024336,39042468,2015-07-20,27782780,Pamela,"This space was wonderful - great neighborhood, and even bigger than it looks in the photos. We really enjoyed our time here. "
3024336,39913647,2015-07-27,1352742,Sam,We had a great time in Seattle while staying at Camille's place. The location was amazing and the place was clean and comfortable. Camille communicated everything very clearly and promptly and I would definitely love to stay at her place again the next time I'm in the beautiful city of Seattle!
3024336,41085777,2015-08-04,35042869,Andrea,"Camille was a wonderful host and we loved our time in this modern home! The extra care she took in approving us to stay, to us only meant that she cares deeply about her home.  We felt very welcome with the list of places she enjoys visiting, maps and tour books, and the couch turned into a bed (that you never would have thought was a couch after the restful sleep it provided.) We found ourselves needing nothing that she didn't already have available for our use. Although we got along without a car, she provided the garage door opener in case we needed it. Capital Hill was a short walk and further on you could get to downtown Seattle. We got around the city by walking and using Ubers - which were great! 
"
3024336,42121485,2015-08-11,33050108,Dan,"I could not have asked for a better first-time Air BnB experience. Camille made everything very easy. From simple and detailed instructions to get into the apartment to a great welcome letter with a list of things to do in the area. Camille's home was in a great neighborhood with easy access to the whole city. Also, the home was even better than the pictures. I had no issue with this listing. I would definitely recommend, Camille is a professional!"
3024336,43246088,2015-08-18,36751368,Kevin,"We had an awesome time here. We were kind of high maintenance with early check in, but Camille was completely accommodating. The neighborhood is great. Good for walking and a good central location to get around on public transit. I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. 

Camille gave us a great list with local restaurants/shops to visit. Highly recommended. "
3024336,44131077,2015-08-24,1326320,Danielle,"This home is stellar. The place is very charming and extremely clean, well appointed and comfortable. The beds are fabulous and we slept very well. Camille has a sweet place!  We've stayed at a lot of airbnb's and this place has an excellent balance of personal charm and anonymous luxury. If you're used to trolling airbnb for the perfect place, then you'll know what I mean. If you're newer to airbnb, then just trust me: this place is a gem. Aside from the kickass kitchen, lovely common space, comfortable beds, squeaky clean condition, and darling outdoor space, it's located in a ultra cool area just walking distance from everything cute about Capitol Hill. Can't recommend this place more. Thank you very much Camille!"
3024336,45382557,2015-09-02,14081889,Alex,"Listing was excellent! They left a lovely detailed note for us with instructions + recommendations of local food, and some great coffee to indulge in. Everything was well kept and clean, the house was pleasant and in a great neighborhood. Overall great!"
3024336,46301742,2015-09-09,202682,Daniel,"Camille's duplex apartment was comfortable and clean. Our favorite feature was the balcony, which overlooked a quaint, leafy street. We also took advantage of the garage which, as the host notes, can only fit a compact car. The location is convenient, with plenty of food and drink options nearby."
3024336,47847536,2015-09-21,5656675,Derek,"Camill'a place was roomy, modern, and very close to all the action in Caphill. The garage parking was a great convenience, though street parking is easy to find. Highly recommended!"
3024336,48772689,2015-09-28,5635394,Michael,"What a wonderful experience! We booked the Sparkling Modern Seattle Home because of its great airbnb reviews and are absolutely happy with our choice. The apartment is situated in a quiet side street close to Pike and Pine Street and offers everyhing we (two couples) could wish for. Two comfortable beds, a fully equipped kitchen and a beautiful bathroom with hot water and fresh towels. The location close to downtown is superb. We went for dinner in Cascina Spinasse which is only two blocks away. Best pasta we ever tasted. Long story short: you don't have to look any further. Book this place and you won't be disappointed! "
3024336,51501348,2015-10-20,10180359,Jeffrey,"Our stay was amazing! Awesome town home in a beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of bars and places to eat nearby which is ideal! We also were able to easily walk downtown and Uber/Cab anywhere else we needed to go. 

The place had everything we needed and was very clean/organized when we arrived. We didn't get to meet Camille but check in was easy and smooth. Would definitely stay again! "
3930270,19949954,2014-09-21,1776713,Caroline,"Adam was a great host and was very easy to communicate with. The space was clean and very comfortable. He made my female travel companion and myself feel comfortable and at ease. He even added a few extra touches like water bottles and maps and guides for us. Everything was very clean and he was really welcoming. Overall a really great experience, highly recommended!"
3930270,20116047,2014-09-23,670550,Jennifer,"I didn't really see Adam much except for during check-in, but he was really awesome and helpful via text. The place was clean and in a great location. I'd totally recommend the place."
3930270,20291158,2014-09-27,19241653,Eleni,"We loved staying with Adam! The room was sunny and beautiful, our bathroom was clean, and we loved his personal touches like Seattle magazine and water bottles on our desk! The location is perfect for walking almost everywhere in the city. We also appreciated his recommendations and his help with parking- he was a great host! I highly recommend staying here."
3930270,20451725,2014-09-29,3211326,Max,"The experience at Adam's was great. The room was clean and comfortable. Despite having to change our check in time at the last minute, Adam was very accommodating."
3930270,20631778,2014-10-02,14551062,Lilian,"We felt very welcome in Adams appartement! It is such as in the pics and we even had our own bathroom. It is in a perfect location to explore the city, next to bars and restaurants and only a short bus ride to the city center (we walked as well). He gave us very good tips for what to do around. Also he got a little puppy while we were there which was pretty exciting. All in all we can highly recommend this place and Adam. Thank you again, it's the details which count (such as water bottles)!"
3930270,20775968,2014-10-05,16660276,Alex,Adam was friendly and responsive via texting to answer any of our questions and help get us from the airport to his place. Adam wasn't able to greet us when we first arrived although we did meet him the next day. The greeter showed us our room and the shower and where everything was in case we needed it. The wi-fi password was conveniently on the desk for us.
3930270,20932691,2014-10-07,21924648,Kimberly,"Adam was very hospitable and flexible with my husband and I. The suite was spacious, beautiful,  clean and comfy.  He provided little extras like water bottles, a fan, Q-tips/cotton balls in the bathroom, and fresh baked banana bread.   He assisted us with transportation options from his house to our destinations.  We appreciated the secure parking on the premises.  We had an early morning departure and unknowingly left an article of clothing behind.  Adam called and met up with us so we could retrieve it. Our first airbnb experience was a very positive one thanks to Adam!  We happily recommend him as a host."
3930270,20975045,2014-10-08,21985282,Alice,Adam is great host!  So is his puppy Ruby.  Both were very warm and welcoming and the room is exactly as described.  The location is perfect.  Overall it was a nice experience.  I would book again!
3930270,21063259,2014-10-10,3582601,Heidi,Adam's apartment was very close to Virginia Mason where we had an appointment the next day.  His apartment was well kept and clean.  He gave us great recommendations for great places to eat.  We were within a mile of Virginia Mason so it was an easy walk.  Parking was available in a safe and secure area.  The neighborhood was quiet and we felt very safe.  Adam was a great host and I would recommend anyone who wants or needs to visit the Capitol Hill neighborhood to book with Adam. 
3930270,21238000,2014-10-13,3952365,Claudia,"Staying with Adam was awesome! The room was very clean and so comfortable. He has a beautiful little puppy which was such a joy after a long day of walking around Seattle. His location near busses, zipcars, and the beautiful Capitol Hill neighborhood made the trip convenient and fun. We were able to do everything we wanted to do in just three days. I highly recommend staying with Adam."
3930270,21480144,2014-10-18,8788858,Matthew,"Staying at Adam's place was great. Adam is a really nice guy and his puppy Ruby is gorgeous!
The room is really big and you have your own private sink and toilet. The Shower is shared. The bed was super comfortable. The wifi was great also.
The location is fantastic! We walked everywhere! Great restaurants and bars just a short walk away.
We highly recommended Adam's place if your looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
3930270,21613455,2014-10-20,21979767,Oleg,"The room was immaculate, bed was super comfortable, bathroom was spotless, shower pressure/temp was amazing"
3930270,21759610,2014-10-23,609750,Stella,"We really enjoyed staying at the Adam's place. The room was clean and cozy(just like it has been shown on the pictures). Adam's recommendations for places to eat were great(it really made our trip special!).  The neighborhood was peaceful and safe and there are streets of hip bars and restaurants just few blocks away. Overall, I would like to stay here again if I visit Seattle again! "
3930270,21854314,2014-10-25,5627459,Nico,"Adam was responsive.  Check-in was easy.  The room was as described.  There were lots of fun bars, restaurants and a park right around the corner.  "
3930270,22040027,2014-10-28,22461210,Connie,"Adam was a good host! We only ran into each other a few times during our 3-night stay, however, he was accommodating and had waters prepared along with all of the necessary bathroom accessories one would need. The location of his flat was a perfect walk or short drive to Cap Hill night-life. Adam provided helpful tips of nearby places upon our request. He was accessible via phone/in-person when we needed, but gave us our space. Bonus: his new puppy was adorable! "
3930270,22174512,2014-10-31,12393648,Brian,"Adam has a very nice, well decorated, and clean apartment. I really enjoyed my stay with him and recommend his apartment to anyone who is looking for a cozy spot to stay on Capitol Hill. Adam's place is only a couple of minutes from a bus stop that will get you downtown in 10 minutes or so and he is also walking distance from all of the clubs/ restaurants/ bars Capitol Hill has to offer."
3930270,22246783,2014-11-02,2408900,Craig,"We had a great trip! Adam was very accommodating;  even changing his plans so that we could gain access to the apartment. He was a great host and was very informative and gave good advice.  The place was very clean and the room was comfortable and spacious.  The location was perfect, so centrally located and close to a ton of shops, restaurants and bars. Thank you Adam!"
3930270,22422019,2014-11-05,20552585,Yvonne,Adam was so nice to communicate with. His house was very clean and comfortable. His dog have plenty of energy but very lovely and well training. The location is about 1 mile  away from the pike market.
3930270,22477925,2014-11-07,12628854,Marcel,"Adam is very friendly and helpful and will answer all your questions.
Everything was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. wifi-connection works well and the parking space was covered. it's indeed very convenient located. we had a great stay"
3930270,22536608,2014-11-09,1905343,Denise,"Adam was a great host from my moment of booking until check out.  He was very accommodating, responding quickly to emails with helpful responses, meeting me around my schedule needs, and helping me feel oriented to the city.  The room and private bathroom (shared shower) are very clean and comfortable and I would happily recommend his place and stay there again."
3930270,22734916,2014-11-13,17794124,(email hidden),"I had a very enjoyable stay at Adam's place while I was in Seattle for a few days. Adam was a gracious host and answered several questions I had about the city and the neighborhood. 

The room was well furnished, clean, and cozy. I believe the original ad says that the bathroom is shared, but it is really just the shower that is shared, which was a nice surprise. 

The location was perfect. I was interviewing at Group Health and Swedish First Hill, and the apartment is within walking distance of both. It is only a 3 block walk to Pine St where all the buses headed downtown pick up. I had easy access to the entire city. The area also seemed safe, and I felt very comfortable walking around at night by myself. 

Overall, a great airbnb experience that I would readily recommend to anyone coming to Seattle. "
3930270,23022698,2014-11-20,23655934,Ryan,"Adam was very nice and hospitable.  The neighbourhood is lively but the room is nice and quiet.  The shared bathroom is just fine.  The place is close enough to downtown to walk in, but there are also easy bus connections.  Great local restaurants recommended by Adam and local shops on 15th Ave and Pike and Pine.  You also get to meet Adam's cute dog Ruby."
3930270,23055860,2014-11-21,4565964,Heidi,"Adam was there to greet us and show us our room and how to get back in later, how to park, etc. Adam was also nice enough to give us quite a few restaurant recommendations and best directions for avoiding downtown traffic. Our room was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this room to others, as well as stay there again. "
3930270,23186386,2014-11-24,23774829,Tim,"Adam's place on Capitol Hill is a great and centrally located, and he made me feel at home right away. If you're looking for a place to stay that is comfortable, in a walkable location, and close to some of the best restaurants Seattle has to offer, this is the place."
3930270,23234591,2014-11-25,24092589,Yuriy,"I enjoyed staying here. Adam is a cool easygoing dude. The place is clean, quiet and nice. Great location for a modest price. Highly recommend staying here."
3930270,23260529,2014-11-26,15620482,Yannick,Very friendly host. Very nice room with private bathroom. Free parking spot. Very close to downtown and hipster neighbourhood.

3930270,23542317,2014-12-03,15869055,Chris,"Adam was a fantastic host, the epitome of Airbnb. He accommodated us very last minute and had tonnes of recommendations for places to see around Seattle. He lives in a great neighbourhood within walking distance of pretty much everything you could want (bars, great restaurants, parks, coffee shops, public transport to downtown etc.) The room is really really nice, comfortable and warm! "
3930270,23565437,2014-12-04,16757874,Tom,"Adam was an awesome dude. Super friendly, and his place was clean and spacious. Good experience!"
3930270,23645090,2014-12-07,18838389,Jazz,"Stayed here 4 nights. Adam was great, everything was super clean and the location AWESOME. Highly recommend. Terrific Airbnb.

Note: 1) if you require a dark room to sleep in bring a sleeping mask as there's a *lovely* window in the room that doesn't block out light 2) there's a short flight of stairs walking up to the apartment, so just be aware if you have lots of luggage.

Thanks Adam!"
3930270,24011782,2014-12-16,3514472,Mallory,Adam was great!  We did not end up staying at his place as we had to get back across the Sound and take care of our sick pup but Adam was very easy to communicate with and seemed to be nothing but accommodating.  We hope to stay at his place the next time we are overnight in Seattle.  What a great location!!!  And Adam seems cool so we would like to meet him in person!
3930270,24025873,2014-12-17,23361683,Jennifer,"Adam is great host. He's very welcoming and accommodative with check-in and out times which was greatly appreciated. He also has tons of recommendations of things to do, see and eat. Everything was neat and super clean and the location of the place is perfect. Lively area, quick bus ride to downtown or one can leisurely walk in 15 minutes. Overall lovely place to stay."
3930270,24128803,2014-12-20,13581483,Weston,"Adam was great! His space is in a great area right in the heart of capitol hill. Awesome host, will definitely try to stay with him again."
3930270,24141751,2014-12-21,3197984,Ali,Adam was a great host! He has a spacious clean spot in an awesome area within Capitol Hill. There is a huge park near by and tasty restaurants and pubs just down the street. Loved it! 
3930270,24346523,2014-12-26,24981207,Chih Chuan,"Great experience! Adam is so nice, he always give us good recommendations about restaurant and viewpoints. Private room is very clean. Adam's place is near by downtown, it is easily to go to some nice places by walk. Highly recommend!"
3930270,24529150,2014-12-30,22669776,Julian,"We had the best time in Seattle, staying with Adam (and Ruby) was fantastic. The whole place was spotless clean and warm enough for us Aussies. Adam was a very friendly and helpful host, chatting with him in the evenings was great and he suggested a bunch of great places to eat and things to do.  His pup Ruby was also wonderful company when we were missing our own dog. Arrival and departure were really easy to organise, Adam was super easy to get in touch with and quick to reply. The apartment was well located, close to downtown with lots of public transport in the area. 
If we return to Seattle we will definitely get back in touch with Adam!"
3930270,24822282,2015-01-03,1627444,Cleris,loved Adan's apartment! location was right in the 'hipster' district with lots of very good restaurants nearby! slightly far from downtown Seattle though. everything was clean and good and adam is so friendly! thanks adam! 
3930270,25209880,2015-01-09,14422772,Andrea,"I spent 5 beautiful days in Seattle, and it was also thanks to Adam. His place is really comfortable and perfectly located, on Capitol Hill close to center (and next to a small cute bar great to have a cup of coffee called Cafe Argento). Beside the location, you will certainly love Adam and his little dog, an incredibly funny animal. Last but not least, Adam is a very kind person with all sort of  good advices about where to go, eat, and what to do, in order to bring back home the best of the city. "
3930270,25294553,2015-01-11,7114571,Danny,The place is good and is conveniently located.  I had no concerns and felt comfortable during my stay.
3930270,25400247,2015-01-14,6851030,Noah,"A totally pleasant, issue-free stay. Incredible, central location. Very comfortable room with wonderful light. Generous amount of space in room and bathroom. Great shower. Host was understanding, accommodating, friendly and helpful. A perfect night in Seattle. Highly recommend. Thank you!"
3930270,25458442,2015-01-16,25972563,Kim,"Great communication with check in! Awesome location, with beautiful view from bedroom of downtown! Super clean and super comfy bed! Thanks Adam & Ruby for a nice stay!"
3930270,25512538,2015-01-18,13731141,Kellie,"Beautiful, clean, spacious room. Attached toilet and sink with lots of towels and even cotton buds/ wool, which was extremely clean and lovely. Shared bathroom was also great! Amazing location with lots of good food nearby! Above a funeral home but if that doesn't bother you, then this is perfect in every other way :) Adam is also very very helpful and kind, with lots of suggestions as to where to eat and what to do. "
3930270,25550211,2015-01-19,9489667,Say,"Adam was friendly and flexible upon our arrival; the room, apartment and neighborhood are all very nice. It was a perfect, if brief, stay. Thank you, Adam!"
3930270,25670297,2015-01-22,26180788,John,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was easy, comfortable, and basically beyond my expectations. Adam was a super host and gave me great restaurant advice. My room rocked -- high ceilings, clean as a whistle, comfortable bed, perfect walking location and even views of the city lights. 5 stars from me. "
3930270,25719662,2015-01-24,25592862,Jasmin,"Comfortable stay and very close to downtown. Room was clean and very spacious. We always took the #10 bus line to get to downtown - only a couple of blocks from Adam's place. It states private bathroom but the shower part was shared.

Check out was at 12 and he had the next people coming in at 12. I didn't really like this since he seemed more concerned with their checking in. He even asked that we give him the keys when we left that morning even though our things were still in the room. Good thing we had everything packed and ready to go. "
3930270,25857119,2015-01-27,6314026,Geneliz,"Adam was a great host! He welcomed us when we got there and gave us tips on how to get around the city and where to eat and such. He was very friendly and accommodating that we felt as if we've known him for a while--like visiting an old friend and giving you an insight to his new neighboorhood type of vibe. Plus his dog Ruby is the smartest and cutest dog i've ever seen in my life! So friendly and charming!

As for the room, it is very clean. Super clean actually! Everything you need is provided, even a Chromecast, local magazines to help you get around, bottles of water, and some snacks. The location is great too! It's super walkable to Pine and Pike and maybe a mile and a half away from Pike Place. It was also convenient that Adam provides his guests with a parking spot. We rented a car during our stay since we wanted to check out Whidbey Island and Leavenworth but if you are only staying in the city, don't bother with a car! Everything is walkable from Adam's place and you can take the bus or the monorail too. Parking sucked in the city so it was really nice that Adam gave me one less thing to worry about by providing us a parking spot. 

Overall, a really great stay! Thanks Adam! :)"
3930270,26110797,2015-02-03,2668790,Michael,"Adam is an excellent host with an immaculate space right in downtown Seattle. The room is large and extremely clean with all the amenities you need. The apartment itself is very large with a great kitchen and space to hang out in the lounge room after exploring Seattle. We loved it so much we could have lived there full time!

Adam is a great host and provided lots of insight and advice on things to do in Seattle. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a good room in Seattle."
3930270,26148374,2015-02-04,14938324,Rachel,A wonderful place to stay. Jessica checked us in for Adam and she was very informative and helpful. The room was clean and super comfortable. The room even has a view of downtown! Would recommend staying with Adam to anyone and everyone.
3930270,26232564,2015-02-07,22254841,Rachel,"Adam was a great host. He was extremely knowledgeable about Seattle and the best places to go. His well-decorated apartment was in a great location in Capitol Hill. Our room was spacious and clean, with a great view of the Seattle skyline. Our private bathroom was spotless, and the shared shower had good water pressure. Meeting his puppy Ruby, a playful sweetheart, was an added bonus."
3930270,26252192,2015-02-08,25666253,Marcus,"Adam was very accommodating, and made the arrival process smooth and easy.  The room was even more than we expected, with great views of downtown.  Capital Hill is definitely a party neighborhood, and the proximity to bars was both a blessing and a curse, with street noise on weekend nights."
3930270,26338335,2015-02-09,26971168,Susan,"Adam was great.  The room was just as described and everything was nice and  clean.  Everything we needed was made available, and Adam communicated to us when needed.  The location was a little further from the more touristy downtown and Space Needle area, but it gave us the opportunity to explore the city by walking.  It was also close to some nice restaurants and bars.  "
3930270,26423500,2015-02-12,18835856,Carlos,"We had such a pleasant time staying in this room! Nice decor, very clean room, great street view, Chromecast for a TV fix, and Adam was very helpful in providing great recommendations for Seattle visitors. Thumbs up!!"
3930270,26537683,2015-02-15,4996505,Robin,"We had a wonderful time staying with Adam over Valentine's weekend! Adam had a busy weekend so we didn't see him much but when we did get to chat with him he was pleasant, friendly, and had great suggestions for fun places to go in the area! The room is spacious, clean, and comfortable and is in a great location! I absolutely recommend staying here!"
3930270,26668790,2015-02-16,3780880,Andy,"Very comfortable, great location, Adam was very helpful, recommend!"
3930270,26922870,2015-02-22,9462459,D.,"Great location, very clean and comfortable room, had wi-fi access appreciated the indoor parking space and Adam was very welcoming and hospitable. We would love to stay here again."
3930270,27112149,2015-02-25,8335372,Julia,"Adam was a great host! He was very helpful in recommending things to do. We didn't see him most of the trip, but he was busy with work and we were busy sightseeing. The room looks exactly as the listing and is a great size with a private bathroom. The neighbourhood he is in is super convenient to everything and walking distance of a lot of great restaurants, cafes and bars. There is even a huge park a block away from his place."
3930270,27212627,2015-02-28,18164001,Christopher,The spot is awesome. The location was great and Adam is a wonderful host. The whole experience was welcoming and warm. The room comfortable and very clean.  I would totally stay here again.
3930270,27312815,2015-03-01,229056,Dee,It was a quick visit. Adam was really helpful and the room was cozy and the bed was perfect!
3930270,27488136,2015-03-05,13004050,Erin,"Our stay with Adam was short and sweet. We needed a convenient pit stop for the night, and Adam's apartment was in the perfect location- walking distance to Pike street which was full of awesome, eclectic bars and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable, and Adam was pretty flexible about our late arrival."
3930270,27559294,2015-03-07,28434679,Will,"friendly host, clean place"
3930270,27853643,2015-03-13,13508212,Szeyin,I stayed at Adam's place for a couple of days when I was planning my move to Seattle. Adam is very knowledgable about the area and he is chill. Overall a positive experience.
3930270,28136431,2015-03-18,24810024,Wen,"Really clean and cozy house! It has all that we needed: the wifi, hot water, heating, and even hair drier. Adam is very considerate and nice. His valuable suggestions help us explore the city better. My friend and I already fell in love with the city."
3930270,28265963,2015-03-21,27904286,Natalie,"Staying at this location was a great choice. The room my friend and I stayed in was clean and well prepared. Adam stocked the room very thoroughly (i.e. Towels, face towels, water bottle, gum). The apt is close to the bus stop so that we could get to downtown easily. Thumbs up! "
3930270,28642423,2015-03-28,21465483,Abigail Joy,"Adam made my guest and I feel very welcomed and at home once we were settled in. The room looks just as it does in the listing and was more roomy than I imagined. The residence was super clean upon arrival and essentials needed throughout our stay were kept stocked. Adam even offered us some of his food when he noticed we were running out of Tapatio and eggs! His dog, Ruby, is very well behaved as well. Overall, I'd recommend this place since it's such a nearby walk to many tourist attractions. 

One thing though - you should know that this residence is above businesses (Dentistry and such). I didn't realize that at first and got a bit confused when I arrived. Totally safe and accessible though!"
3930270,29312055,2015-04-06,28822433,Reinelle,"I really enjoyed staying at Adam's place. It's a super short walk to bars and restaurants and about a mile from downtown. The room was cozy and comfortable, and met all of our basic needs. We even got to play with his cute puppy. Thanks for everything!"
3930270,29491115,2015-04-08,22259739,Shaoyu,Adam is a great host. He prepared the clean and beautiful room nicely with plenty of utility to make it feel like home to us. He responded quickly and considered our circumstance to allow us check in earlier. He is warmhearted to give suggestions on tourism and food. We had a great time here!
3930270,29674957,2015-04-11,28500252,Tom,We had a great time at Adam's. Room was nice and spacious with clean bathroom just outside the bedroom. Location also good and close to pike and pine streets where there's lots going on
3930270,29805816,2015-04-12,30921613,Alex,The stay was amazing!! Very helpful not to far from all the things to see. Ruby was so sweet and playful. Wish my stay was longer. If you ever are in Seattle and need a place to see hit up Adam. Thanks again!!!!
3930270,29883824,2015-04-13,689580,Andrew,Great location with secure parking in a garage (a big plus for us). Adam was a bit slow responding but in the end everything worked out great.
3930270,30046962,2015-04-16,7892163,Eleanor,"Overall my sister and I had a great time in Seattle. The room was exactly as described, the bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed Netflix in the evenings. The neighbourhood was very convenient, close to restaurants, stores, and a short walk to the market. However there was some miscommunication before we got there. We had trouble contacting the host because we did not know that he didn't want to be contacted on his phone due to the LD charges. The host was upset that we did not check the website for the messages he left, but were unable to as we were driving from Canada. The website provided me with his messages and we responded back to the host's number but did not get a reply. Arriving at the location, the host expressed how we inconvenienced him because he was unsure when we would arrive and that he did not work that day because of us. We apologized and tried to explain how we tried to contact him. Check in was at 4pm and we sent messages saying we would arrive at 10pm. The host was helpful in explaining the area, how to get around, what to do, and where to go. We did feel uncomfortable and unwelcome during that first conversation but still enjoyed our two nights in Seattle. "
3930270,30070037,2015-04-17,25322870,Alex,"Quiet, comfortable space, beautiful room and great location. Adam was incredibly friendly and helpful to us during our visit, and Ruby the pup is adorable!"
3930270,30379993,2015-04-21,26761532,Matt,"Adam and I had a misunderstanding, but I’m hopeful we can work things out so I can recommend his place with as much enthusiasm as others.

A friend and I stayed here four nights while attending a conference. Adam was away on a trip for most of the time, but he made it easy for us to access his place. When packing up, we had trouble getting the foldout couch to close properly, which we mentioned to Adam before leaving. About an hour later, Adam texted me that we had damaged the foldout, and he was upset that we had not told him. Adam acknowledged that the foldout had been damaged and patched up prior to our stay. I immediately offered to pay for any damage that we caused to the foldout but have not heard back from him.

Adam and his place (and his dog!) were otherwise wonderful. This was my first airbnb trip, and I hope to use it again."
3930270,30580500,2015-04-24,509657,Heena,It's perfect location if you are looking for bar hopping. The room is upstairs and Adam gives you spare key so you can get in at whatever time you want. Room has comfy bed and comforter. Bathroom has fresh clean towels.Adam is a great host and gave us list of places we should visit and eat.Overall we had a good stay at adams house
3930270,30786922,2015-04-27,29599221,Gregg,"Adam was a great host.  Upon arriving in Seattle, I met him at his place where he gave me a set of keys to his home.  The room upstairs is very nice and quiet.  His location is in a great part of Seattle.  Lots of eateries, coffee houses and bars.  If you are staying only in the Seattle area, you will not need a car when staying with Adam.  I walked most of time, but used the bus when needed which does drop you off close to his home. He also gave me great recommendations on where to eat.  These were great spots that I would not have found if it was not for Adam's recommendation.  
Overall, I had a great experience in Seattle.
Thank you again Adam for being a great host.

Gregg"
3930270,31054433,2015-05-01,28320077,Zixuan,Living in Adam's home is quite amazingly good experience. The room upstairs for us is quite nice with a comfortable bed and a large bathroom. The laundry is convenient. Adam also offered us a parking place which helped a lot.  The neighborhood is very safe and clean. Easy access to pike place market and many great places. Adam sold us a large suitcase with incredibly low price. Thank you Adam! You are a great host and your help makes Seattle a more friendly and greater city for us. Sorry for the late review as we are constantly on the move. 
3930270,31186934,2015-05-03,28780964,Steph,"The photos were accurate, the bed was made just like this and was very comfortable. The room itself was private and spacious, located on the second floor and accessed from the front hallway, so I didn't have to enter Adam's space at all. I loved the high gabled ceiling and the big window offered a view of a quiet side street through a leafy tree. Lots of closet and drawer space, a desk, a window seat, and a fine looking TV that I didn't use. Temperature was easily controlled by opening the window or turning on the heat. The bathroom was also spacious and clean with a separate shower room. 
Adam was a warm and friendly host, offering assistance and recommendations where needed. Great location!"
3930270,32529257,2015-05-19,2197664,Chris & Christine,"Clean, comfortable, and centrally located. Good place to explore Seattle from."
3930270,32927983,2015-05-23,11638983,Europa,"Thank you Adam for taking time to explain directions and points of interest. The space was very clean and as described. It was a short downhill walk to the downtown area. Above all, I really appreciated the ride to the bus station. "
3930270,33085803,2015-05-25,5355763,Derek,"Located among all the attractions on Capitol Hill, Adam's place was perfect for my weekend stay. Appreciated the off-street parking space for my rental car. The room is comfy and Adam was very responsive when coordinating check-in and check-out."
3930270,33331956,2015-05-26,1704346,Andrea,"I had a wonderful experience with Adam for my very first night in Seattle. He offered great insight on the places to visit and to eat. The room was beautiful, clean, and organized. It's situated in a great part of town. Walking distance to a lot of local shops and great food. Highly recommend staying in this lovely room! "
3930270,33586527,2015-05-30,4265388,Tim,"Good communication, spacious room, great location."
3930270,34070948,2015-06-04,31660441,Dan,"Adam was extremely accommodating. Just as an example, he was willing to let me drop my bags off prior to the official check-in time. This was very convenient as it let me explore the neighborhood easily, and I greatly appreciated it. His recommendations for food and the like were spot on. I would be happy to stay there again. 

Cap Hill is a great neighborhood to stay in if you want to be in the 'Hip' neighborhood bar and food-wise. It's convenient to the standard downtown museums and attractions. "
3930270,34628806,2015-06-10,16545505,Jo,"I stayed at Adam's place on one of the hottest days in Seattle and it was perfectly comfortable.  The room is bigger than depicted in the photos, and the bathroom is big too.   Adam kindly carried my bags up and down the stairs, even getting up early in the morning to do so, gave lots of tips for the neighborhood, and efficiently helped solve a technology problem I had.   He was not around much, so it was like having a townhouse to myself.  His dog was quiet, and was not near the bedroom area on the top floor.  The location was a pleasant walk to downtown and the hill was not onerous at all, and there a several buses a block away. "
3930270,34732278,2015-06-11,34195212,Karmen,Adam's place was perfect for my stay! Great location in capital hill and very close to public transport. I took advantage of his free parking and it worked out great with my rental car! The bed was very comfortable and the room was as described. I would definitely stay with Adam and his amazing pup Ruby again!
3930270,35067496,2015-06-15,28575474,Marguerite,"We will be back.  The space was private, clean and quiet.  
We were able to come and go with ease.  Having a secured parking space on Capitol Hill was the best!"
3930270,35346939,2015-06-17,35354789,Tanmay,"I had a wonderful experience at Adam's place. He was really helpful and friendly (helped me carry my numerous suitcases, thank you again Adam). The apartment is located in a very happening Capitol Hill area of Seattle and is accurate with the picture description. One suggestion to Adam would be if you could keep a couple of water bottles in the room it would be awesome."
3930270,37133013,2015-07-05,27430817,Seth,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It was the ideal location for us to explore Seattle from, with easy access to downtown and a quick bus ride to lake Washington. The area immediately around the place has an endless variety of bars and restaurants - it's the best part of town for nightlife, but the apartment itself is just a couple blocks removed from all of it so if you go to bed early you won't be kept awake by the bar crowd.
Adam could not have been more accommodating, answering all our questions and offering a ton of helpful suggestions. He and his girlfriend even gave us a ride to the light rail station when there were no ubers around. You could have as much or as little contact with him as you wanted.
Ruby, the dog, is amazing."
3930270,37359318,2015-07-06,35523922,Peng,"Adam is a great host! The communication was smooth. He always responded immediately. He prepared two electrical fans for us in case of hot weather. He provided us cool bottled water and ice cubes. He also gave us extra linen. The room was so big, with TV and even chromecast! Bathroom has everything, cotton and cotton sticks, shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner... I had a really nice night in his house. Really recommend this!"
3930270,37492566,2015-07-07,23987396,Kelsey,Adam was great! He welcomed us in and gave us some great directions and info on some local transportation.  Awesome host - would totally recommend.

3930270,38123849,2015-07-13,33130106,Christoph,"Great stay at Adam's place. The room has everything you need and is located right next to some bars & cafes in the hip capitol Hill neighborhood. To downtown Seattle it's a 20-30min walk or a short ride on the Bus.
Adam is a nice guy who gave us a good overview and some tips what to do in seattle
Don't miss out on bakery nouveau on 15th avenue - amazing breakfast"
3930270,38431325,2015-07-15,5698621,Steph,"We enjoyed our stay at Adam's place. It is large, had full amenities was clean, and is in a great location with some awesome eats in the neighbourhood. Adam gave us a great orientation of Seattle in the first half hour we arrived and visiting Seattle's sights was a breeze for us from his place. We walked everywhere! We enjoyed our stay very much."
3930270,38570952,2015-07-16,38391684,Christine,"Our stay with Adam was our first Airbnb experience.  Adam was very kind and understanding about some of the logistical difficulties we had, as we had just arrived in the US.  The room was very clean, tidy and spacious.  The bed, very comfortable and welcome after over 20 hrs of flying.  We found everything met or exceeded our expectations.  Adam is a lovely host...met us downstairs and helped carry our heavy bags, plus gave us great neighborhood recommendations.  We would stay here again."
3930270,39005924,2015-07-20,28295224,Elena,"Adam was such a great host! Our flights got in late, which was no problem, he waited and welcomed us as we arrived. He answered all or questions and gave us some really great tips on where to go, what to see and how to get there. 
The room is bright and clean with a bathroom right next to it. The apartment is in a nice and safe area in walking distance to almost everything. Buses are just a block away, there is a really nice park just around the corner, it is 2 blocks away from Pine and Pike Street and it only takes about 20 minutes to walk downtown to Pike Market Place. 
We really enjoyed staying and chatting with Adam and we absolutely loved his cute little dog Ruby! 
I would highly recommend staying with Adam, it's the perfect location for a stay in Seattle. "
3930270,39762049,2015-07-26,30748412,Megumi,"The space was very clean and inviting, and could not be in a more convenient location for exploring capitol hill and  downtown Seattle. Parking spot was also a big plus and Adam was very nice and gave us some great recommendations to make the most of our stay. "
3930270,40337945,2015-07-30,32789352,Samantha,We had a great time and appreciate Adam for being a great host. He was very accommodating and met us much later than we planned as our original flight had been cancelled. He gave us a lot of information about the city and neighborhood and has the information available in the room. The room is just a short walk from the bus station and city bike share locations. Everything looked the same as in the pictures. We had a great time and hope to one day come back. 
3930270,42103037,2015-08-11,7445458,Nicole,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3930270,42164445,2015-08-11,33922820,Alexander,"The stay was great. The room was clean and had everything I needed. The Chromecast was great for killing time while I rested up between outings during the day. The location of the apartment was also excellent. It is a quick walk from all the Capitol Hill highlights, and even downtown if you're someone who doesn't mind a 1.5–2 mile jaunt. Adam was a great host."
3930270,43953678,2015-08-23,4168426,Celia,"It was an amazing location in Capitol Hill - Adam was very accommodating, we enjoyed our stay!  The apartment has everything extra you would need (sheets, towels, hair dryer) and despite the heat wave was mostly pretty cool with the fans on.  The bed was very comfy!"
3930270,46924028,2015-09-14,16339680,Christoph,Adam is a great host. The room is very nice and clean and the bed very comfortable. It's easy to get to City Centre of Seattle by feet (about 15 min walk). 
3930270,47268916,2015-09-17,27189523,Na,We had a really nice stay at Adam's place. He was really helpful in allowing us flexible check in and check out times. He was gone most of the time so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The room is very clean and comfortable. There is a lot of information about Seattle for visitors inside the desk drawer. The room is within walking distance of many hotels and we walked to Pike Place and the space needle etc and there is always an Uber available. Great experience overall
3930270,47822299,2015-09-21,43219086,Shirley,"Very good location.  Adam worked around our schedule for arrival.  The bed was comfortable.  There are, however, a lot of stairs in the apartment, inside and out, which could have been troublesome.  Adam left shortly after we got there and, at that point, we had access to the kitchen and T.V.  All in all, it turned out to be very good."
3930270,48706640,2015-09-28,39953764,James,"This was our first AirBnB and we were absolutely delighted.  The room is lovely, great location and parking was a real bonus.  Adam did everything he could for us, including some great local recommendations."

Very clean bathroom, comfortable bed, and perfect location. Everything is ready just needed to move in to enjoy your trip. The parking lot that we were offered was good, very safety. If you wanna have fun in Seattle and wanna find a room to live in then you should not miss it! "

3930270,55487982,2015-12-01,26829445,Suo,"Adam's place is a good one. The community is quiet, but not very far away from main resorts to go. You can view the scenery in your room. However, we have a misunderstanding of the check-in time, which made me a little bit upset. Therefore, I highly recommend guest to double-check check-in time B4 arriving. "
3930270,55860801,2015-12-06,50129923,Sunit,"Cant say enough about the location! Its at the heart of Capitol Hill. I never had to drive anywhere. 
The room is decent and the bed super comfy. Would be nice to have darker curtains on the tall window- for those days you want to sleep in a little. 
Adams a good guy and full of useful tips (especially about food :-))"
3930270,56555006,2015-12-14,50614255,Kera,"Adam was very welcoming and had honest and informative insight into Seattle life and its changing culture. He also had tons of recommendations for places to check out in the area - food, drink, fun, what have you! The room was perfectly clean and comfortable, bathroom well stocked, and location in Capitol Hill ideal. I was only in town for one night, and am so grateful to have had space of my own to relax and decompress. "
3930270,56766266,2015-12-17,18278332,Aksel,"Adam was an awesome host for my girlfriend and I, he was able to accommodate us on 24 hour notice. The room was excellent, very clean and comfortable and in a great neighborhood of Seattle. Adam took the time to tell us about a few of the neighborhood spots and was extremely welcoming. I would definitely recommend his listing, we'll be staying with him if we return."
3930270,56891372,2015-12-19,50939740,Megan,"Adam was welcoming from the start! My friend and I drove straight from the airport to his house, directions were easy and the parking spot was extremely convenient! The room was spacious, filled with natural light, and all the creature comforts of 'home'. I slept great, the bed was so comfortable, and it was nice having Chromecast on the TV to watch before bed (we were out pretty late, seeing the sights and sounds of Seattle!). Thank you, Adam, for a cozy place to stay. "
3930270,57160712,2015-12-22,26213625,Zoe,Great space in a great spot. Lots of options for eating and sight seeing. Felt like we were completely secluded. 
7872818,48854743,2015-09-28,7785188,Mark,"This was a fantastic airbnb experience. Judy and Bill were kind and welcoming, and the apartment is great. The bed is very comfortable, with soft cotton sheets and a down blanket. And the private bathroom is brand new and has a tub and separate shower. There's also a huge and beautiful outdoor space. A perfect stay in a beautiful city! I highly recommend. "
7872818,48976656,2015-09-29,18778076,Rebecca,"A sumptuously comfortable bed and luxurious spa-like bathroom, coupled with a great location and relaxing outdoor garden, made my stay here a truly recharging experience. Add to that that Judy and Bill have thought of and attended to everything I might need -- a Nespresso coffee maker, tea kettle, refrigerator, microwave, not to mention of course soap, towels, body lotion, hair dryer, etc. Bedroom and bathroom have clearly been newly remodeled, and very tastefully. The deep enormous bathtub beckoned to me the whole time. The shower is modern with a satisfying stream. The location is good too-- step outside and you can see the space needle of downtown and the mountains on East and West. And it's less than a mile from UW, and under 30 minutes from the airport. But most of all, that bed, and those sheets! Truly blissful sleep. "
7872818,49298342,2015-10-02,8120307,Gregory,"Judy and Bill hosted my girlfriend Fiona and I on very short notice as we passed through Seattle on a road trip.  They told us that they were new to being AirBnB hosts, but I wouldn't have guessed it if they didn't tell us!

The space is very cozy and comfy, warm, bright, and spacious.  We had our own entrance and our own garden which I wish we had more time to use!

A selection of coffees and teas, granola, yogurt, and fruit was waiting for us for the morning.  Plenty of towels in the beautiful bright bathroom.  Seattle books, maps, and magazines were available for browsing, but they gave us a good set of suggestions for places to eat dinner and breakfast both.

I would recommend their space to anyone staying in Seattle.  The neighborhood is quite and beautiful, not hard to find, and close to some quaint little neighborhood centers."
7872818,49740066,2015-10-05,41182216,Aidan,"Lovely hideaway!  We loved our stay and felt very much at home.  Being greeted by warm socks, a charming bedroom with private bath, and home made granola was a real treat.  The private garden is just a delight for anyone looking to unwind. The location is very convenient to hiking/biking trails, the U District, and to the highway. Judith and Bill are very accommodating and thoughtful. And there is free wifi to boot! The next time we visit Seattle, I hope we can stay again."
7872818,49957199,2015-10-07,37428882,Gayle,"Judith did a tremendous job with her Airbnb. The bed is comfortable with great down pillows. The place is immaculate and there are special touches throughout from cozy socks to wear, area magazines, and beautiful rugs in the bedroom and hallway. One truly feels like an honored guest. Be sure to read the booklet that Judith put together. This location is close to parks, the University of Washington, the Burke-Gilman Trail, and the University Village for shopping. Great restaurant list and reviews!"
7872818,51095961,2015-10-17,3491251,J.M.,"I stayed in Seattle for the start of my vacation and had a wonderful experience with Judy and Bill. Their unit offered plenty of privacy, was located conveniently to small shops, and within walking distance of fabulous views of Mt. Rainier. I did not have a car, but still found it very easy to use public transportation. Judy was there when I arrived and permitted me to check-in early to their very well appointed basement unit. There were lots of thoughtful amenities and best of all the place was very clean and quiet. A great place to relax away from my usual downtown haunts. "
7872818,51367388,2015-10-19,32007621,James,"Judy and Bill were wonderful hosts. The newly remodeled apartment was clean and a delightful place to sleep and hang out. Judy and Bill made me feel right at home. The location was perfect, close to Magnusson Park, the district and many great restaurants. Thank you."
7872818,53998761,2015-11-15,10423221,Mike,"I lived near this neighborhood for many years in Seattle and Judith's beautiful house and hospitality made me feel at home again. Everything during our stay was perfect, from the comfortable bed, to the excellent shower, to all the lovely amenities. 

Judith's homemade granola alone is worth a trip back! 

Although off the beaten path, this home is in a great part of Seattle and can really give you the flavor of living in one of Seattle's neighborhoods rather than being trapped amongst the tourists. 

Everything about this stay was easy and flawless. Judith provides excellent and detailed directions on access, wifi, and otherwise enjoying the space. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it."
7872818,54767698,2015-11-23,566479,Annette,A wonderfully charming place with lovely hosts. Very clean and so comfortable. Good location too. 
7872818,55863808,2015-12-06,1355411,Janet,Judith's Secret Garden Retreat was absolutely perfect!  The studio is very well appointed. The bed is super comfy with high quality linens and pillows. The bath area is quite large complete with bath salts!  This is a special place and it is obvious Judith and her husband worked hard to make it that way. Probably the most tidy Air BnB I have had the pleasure of renting. Enjoy!  
7872818,56668086,2015-12-16,23519441,David,Judith and Bill made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood is quiet and very centrally located.
7198282,39864848,2015-07-26,32150816,Brahmjot,"This experience of mine at Neil's place deserves 5 perfect stars on each aspect (in fact more). Neil was super responsive with all his communications, and flexible with my time of arrival.

On getting inside his apartment, I was completely blown. He has a very nicely decorated place in a quite neighborhood. He and his girlfriend were super friendly and showed me around the whole house.  The room was way better than the pictures suggest. Super  comfy bed, and the bathroom was right adjacent to the room. 

I can confidently recommend to anyone looking for a great comfortable stay, at Neil's place. I will definitely come back!"
7198282,41143982,2015-08-04,38961044,Jasmin,"Absolutel recommendable. Neil is a very friendly warm-hearted person. We missed out flight and he didn't charge the room for this night. The house, bedroom and bathroom were big and clean. There were two bus tickets, umberellas, traveller magazines and fresh water on the table like a hotel room. We had a great time there. Thumbs up. "
7198282,41544558,2015-08-07,35743867,Humna,"Neil was an amazing host! His house was lovely and the bed was super comfortable. 
His girlfriend made us a welcome package, it was really sweet! Neil was so friendly and welcoming!!
Next time we're in Seattle, we know where we will go! "
7198282,41565485,2015-08-07,40646932,Quinn,"Very welcoming and friendly hosts. Accommodations were excellent. They were astoundingly professional, made it seem like theyd had years of experience"
7198282,43291820,2015-08-18,27940172,Vadim,"I'm not a good writer, so I'll make it short. It was a pleasure staying with Neil. Thank you for hosting us!"
7198282,43581066,2015-08-20,32096758,实,"Neil is a 5 star host, he is so friendly and warm. His girl friend is also very nice and considerate. The apartment is clean, quiet and cozy, and has everything that you need even the bus card. Also his house is located near Northgate mall(1 bus stop), so it's very convenient to find restaurants, mall and cinema nearby. The house itself is spacious and very confortable.

For me, Neil is more than a host, he is now a friend. I will definitely visit him again when I go to Seattle next time. A hug from St Louis :)"
7198282,44857803,2015-08-29,35631645,Andrew,"Neil greeted us at the door of his comfortable, clean, thoughtfully set-up home in Seattle and  told us everything we needed to know to have a great stay. The bedroom was as described and was a clean and comfortable space. Neil made many extra touches to make this space comfortable (provided extra towels and toiletries available and labeled the kitchen. ) Great overall experience."
7198282,45413525,2015-09-02,38601250,Ronald,"Neil and his girlfriend are the best AIRBNB host, the place is a big house and you have access to the hole place, we really enjoyed the kitchen.
I didn't believe how clean and neat they had everything, so organized. They even put extra tooth brushes and other stuff in the toilet in case you forget yours, that's the level of comfort you will get with them.
As far as the neighbor, even tough is not down town you will not drive more than 15 minutes to get there, the green lake park is really close so you can go there to run or if you go with kids it will be great too. In the same area lots of restaurants and coffee shops. I will so much look for them if I ever go back to Seattle, forget about hotels.."
7198282,46994660,2015-09-14,3368016,Randy,"Neil has been a very good host. The place is exactly as described. I will certainly come back again.
"
7198282,47226597,2015-09-16,3368016,Randy,excellent host and excellent place!
7198282,47924680,2015-09-21,40302826,Tatiana,"Neil - отличный хозяин, улыбающийся молодой человек, отвечает быстро, все правила дома четкие, все было понятно. Предоставил зонтик, воду, карточку на автобус системы Orca с одной поездкой. Дом большой, комната большая, чисто. На кухне все шкафчики подписаны, как сортировать мусор написано. Никто не задает вопросы, никого не видно и не слышно. Кровать очень удобная. Но лучше быть на машине, идти на мой взгляд далековато, хотя там находится транзитный автобусный центр (можно уехать до разных мест)"
7198282,49061274,2015-09-30,15543891,Tessa,"Neil's place was clean and quiet, exactly what was needed!"
7198282,52356128,2015-10-28,43883559,Nikolai,"Overall my stay at Neil's house was wonderful (as mentioned in my previous review). The room is nice and clean, contains a very comfortable bed and is directly next to the bathroom. If you are searching for an uncomplicated stay inside a nice house with a great host this might be what you are looking for."
7198282,54334783,2015-11-18,3903741,Ariel," This was the best *shared Airbnb I've stayed at. I was very comfortable using the common kitchen and dining areas, and crossing paths with the host felt free of awkwardness. Neil was very kind and welcoming, hands-off but quick to respond to any issue. I could hear the people above and below me. Luckily that wasn't much of an issue. Enjoyed my week stay, great value."
7198282,55581814,2015-12-02,9668791,Porter,"I stayed with Neil for 2 weeks when I first moved to Seattle while looking for an apartment of my own. He is a great host, and the bedroom was just as described with a comfortable bed, large desk, and walk-in closet. The house is large with lots of common space, but generally very quiet.  The kitchen was well equipped for the light cooking I did. Parking was easy, and getting to/from downtown isn't too bad by car or bus, just remember rush hour traffic can be brutal.


Neil was prompt with communication before/during my stay and was very helpful when I needed to modify my reservation dates. Overall I would definitely recommend Neil and his house to guests looking for a relaxed and quiet place to stay"
3975434,18772995,2014-08-31,709337,Connor,Victor was great! Nice room in a central location. 
3975434,18868723,2014-09-01,17426720,Andrew,"Vincent was accommodating with my arrival a bit later than expected and last minute reservation. The apartment is nicely furnished and within walking distance to some cafe's, nightlife, and not too far from the Space Needle. A few things to note, the washer/dryer are not located in the unit but in the building and require quarters and there is only 1 of each so you may have to wait to do a load. The bedroom is very tight and the bed is small and has a crease down the middle (because it is broken into a left side and right side then put together) and I didn't sleep well. There is also parking on the adjacent streets that was not too difficult to find (just don't park in front of the building or you will get a ticket). "
3975434,19494405,2014-09-13,5694681,Bonnie And Dave,"Vincent's is in a neighborhood close to the Space Needle and a very pleasant walk toward downtown. He gave me a walking map to my conference and recommended a great coffee shop just around the corner that I stopped at 3 times. His style is minimal, everything is carefully placed and the apartment is spotlessly clean. The room was perfectly set up with a reading lamp, luggage rack, hangers in the closet and an operable window for fresh air. The bed is comfortable (I slept soundly) and the linens were new and comfortable. I would definitely stay with him again. "
3975434,19583302,2014-09-14,21260857,Mareechi,My girlfriend and I had a very nice time in Seattle and it was a delight to have Vincent as our host. He was a most friendly soul and considerate  he showed us around the place and was able to guide us to some very nice eateries in Belltown. All in all a most pleasant stay and a short distance to great nightlife. 
3975434,19812037,2014-09-18,2067201,Jason,"I had a brief, one-night stay with Vincent when business kept me in Seattle for an extra night. He was a great host — friendly and responsive — and I found the private room in his apartment to be comfortable, quiet and very convenient to Seattle Center. Ask him about the amazing, life-changing work his nonprofit does around the world!"
3975434,19909638,2014-09-20,21327929,Meltem,Vincent was a great host and very considerate. He waited up to let us in because our flight arrived pretty late. The apartment is very centrally located and the room is comfortable. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we had to alter our reservation.
3975434,28311657,2015-03-22,13621147,Dave,"I really enjoyed staying at Vincent's apartment.   I came to Seattle to see my daughter (recent grad from UW) who lives very close by.  Vincent's apt is in a great location, near downtown, Lake Union, and you can see the space needle from his living room.
The room I stayed in was great.  The combination of cool Seattle air, quiet location (room faces back of apt), and comfy bed allowed me to sleep very well.
Vincent is a very friendly guy who made me feel immediately at home.  I was on the go most of my time in Seattle, but enjoyed the time I did spend at his place.   I was especially entertained by his playful cats.   Vincent has great knowledge of the city, although I already had my days planned out since I've visited Seattle many times.  "
3975434,34316615,2015-06-07,32083119,Nick,"Vincent was an excellent host. I stayed at his place for 3+ weeks, while settling into Seattle, and throughly enjoyed my stay. The apartment was very spacious and very clean. There were tons of good places to eat and major transit lines within a few blocks. It is right next to Seattle center and situated in a really nice neighborhood. Vincent was accommodating, courteous and welcoming. Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying here. "
3975434,34786067,2015-06-12,32453377,Jimmy,Wonderful location and cute cats. 
3975434,35692684,2015-06-21,8053278,Heather,"Vincent was a fabulous host!! He was a very gracious and accommodating. The view from the apartment is amazing, and it's only a short walk to the Space Needle. There were lots of great cafes and coffee shops within walking distance as well. I'd stay here again just to stay in the super comfortable bed!! "
3975434,36448418,2015-06-28,35792561,Jasmine,"Vincent was a great host! He made us feel very welcomed from the first minute we arrived. The place is very beautiful and in a PERFECT location. He had everything ready for us when we arrived and we would definitely stay there again. The bed was so comfortable. 

Our interactions with Vincent definitely helped us get a feel for the culture of the city. He answered all the questions we had and got us in the right direction for exploring. We definitely recommend staying here."
3975434,37401815,2015-07-06,36905101,Amy,"Vincent was a nice host. He prepared kinds of maps for traveling. I stayed there for one week. The location of apartment is convenient to take bus to downtown Seattle or walk to the Space Needle/Lake Union. Oh yeah, there are two cute cats you will like."
3975434,38837077,2015-07-19,32307281,Dr. Mark,This is a nice place to stay at a convenient location. Vincent is a great guy and very accommodating. 
3975434,39792923,2015-07-26,2788863,Rigel,"Vincent was a great host, he gave really detailed list of activities to do in and around Seattle, and pretty accommodating. He also at one point called to ask how we were doing on a rainy day which o thought was sincere. I would highly recommend his home for anyone looking for a really convenient neighborhood and great host."
3975434,40164179,2015-07-28,16541913,Paige,"This was one of the best AirBNB locations I've ever booked. The room was exactly as described and very comfortable. Vincent was a great host, providing info on local points of interest and generally welcoming us into his home. His cats are cute and social as well. "
3975434,41972484,2015-08-10,34532909,Jorge,Vincent was a great host. From the time I stepped in the door he made me feel at home in Seattle. He offers a lot of information about sightseeing and local places to eat. I would love to stay here again. Thanks Vincent!
3975434,44538904,2015-08-27,5486602,Tanin,"We stayed here for around 20 days. The apartment is spacious and clean. It locates in a very nice, safe, and walkable area; It is close to a supermarket and space needle. There are also multiple restaurants around.

Vincent has been a welcomed host and accommodated our need for late checkout.

Hugo and Leo, the cats, are friendly and cute. We miss them already!"
9012948,52668525,2015-10-31,47464538,Nathan,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4943016,26718536,2015-02-17,7255429,Neal,"I visited Seattle with a few friends and the apartment was great! However, please see the con I listed below. 

Pros: 
-Everything inside felt very new and modern
-Super great location (right between Downtown and Capitol Hill)
-Lots of great places to eat (everything necessary was walking distance, including the grocery store)
-Hot shower!
-Rachel & Grace were quick to help us out when we needed extra bed sheets; they were easy to communicate with. 

Cons:
-We visited in February and the apartment was stuffy at times and we had the open the windows (I don't think there was an AC unit). The downside of this was that we could then hear the freeway in the middle of the night as the apartment is near I-5. This was a bit troublesome (especially for light sleepers) but I think it could be resolved with a simple fan to keep the bedroom cool and the windows closed. 

Please note: I gave only 4 stars for the location because of this con.


"
4943016,28865872,2015-03-31,11726838,Stacy,"As always, Grace is an excellent host. The space is exactly as it's described and pictured--her condo is incredible! Grace goes to great lengths to make sure her guests are comfortable and have everything they need. She stayed up late to help us check in, and responded quickly to all of my texts. She is our go-to host anytime we stay in Seattle. Thanks for everything, Grace!"
4943016,41066965,2015-08-04,25281984,Paul Jason,Beautiful and comfortable apartment in a great location!  The host was very accommodating to any additional needs I needed!  Highly recommend!  
4943016,48557975,2015-09-27,32596499,Cy,Really enjoyed our visit to Seattle. Great location with easy I5access and all of the downtown highlights in easy walking distance. Rachel and Grace could not have been more accommodating hosts. They went out of their way to make our visit enjoyable.
1252740,6354095,2013-08-09,7722100,Emily,"We had a fabulous stay with Durwood.  First of all, Durwood was an excellent host.  He is happy to share his favorite Seattle spots and recommend places in his neighborhood.  It was great to chat with him and he made us coffee upon our arrival.  And he left us a bus pass.

We stayed 3 nights; the private bathroom was perfect for our group; two of us shared the bedroom and we also used the pull-out bed in the office.  It was just what we were looking for - a clean place to sleep and central to getting around the city.  His neighborhood offered lots of restaurants, bars, and coffee yet it was super easy to catch the bus downtown.  We also did a lot of walking to and from his home.  "
1252740,6541777,2013-08-16,7762217,Allen,"Durwood Gafford was the perfect host. He is very knowledgeable  about Seattle and offered timely information, which facilitated our getting around  on public transportation. Durwood is a fascinating conversationalist. 
His location is within easy walking distance of neighborhood coffee shops, stores, restaurants, and public transportation.
It is close to Fremont St., on which Passeo (the famous Caribbean Sandwich Shop),  Ha! ( a great little bar and restaurant), and the Book Larder, a community cookbook store, are located. The Seattle Zoo and Rose Garden are a longer, but pleasant walk in the other direction.
We were thoroughly pleased with our host, our stay, and our Seattle home; we highly recommend it. "
1252740,7016382,2013-09-03,7673578,Beth,Durwood was a wonderful host. We felt very comfortable and welcome..the accomodations were great and Durwood gave us some super ideas of places to visit in his neighborhood. I will stay with him again. 
1252740,7422789,2013-09-19,1472293,Cathy,"I enjoyed my stay at Durwood's home and would stay there again.
His home is located in a very desirable location in Seattle.
There are many wonderful restaurants and shops within easy walking distance .
I had my own car, it was great to have a parking space off the street. It would be really easy to access public transport if needed by a visitor. 
I come to Seattle often and thought I knew a lot about great restaurants. I ended up using 3 of Durwood's suggestions while I was there and enjoyed them all immensely !"
1252740,8064002,2013-10-14,1472293,Cathy,"Durwood is a great host. 
This was my second visit to his home.
It is a great location and would work well if you don't have a car available. Very good parking in his driveway if you choose to have a vehicle.
There are great restaurants very close within 2-3 blks. of his home.
The room is comfortable and the computer access is very much appreciated.
"
1252740,10325550,2014-02-13,11665269,Paul,Durwood went out of his way to make my travel experience a pleasant one! He is a knowledgeable and gracious host.
1252740,10551140,2014-02-24,11524578,Joseph,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Durwood's home. The private bedroom and bathroom were clean and Durwood was very friendly and helpful. I certainly would stay there again.
1252740,10936310,2014-03-14,10684988,Eric,Definitely an amazing host! Made sure everything was in order and is had everything I needed. Great visit and would and may do it again! The area is even perfect for Seattle. Super cute
1252740,11428949,2014-04-02,11877733,Linda & Garry,"Our stay with Durwood was a blast!  He is a fun, gracious, and generous host.  Our accommodations were clean, comfortable and exactly as presented in the posting.  Accessing our room was easy and we were able to come & go as we pleased.  We also had access to the kitchen & living room any time we wanted.  We had our son over for dinner on two occasions and got along so well with Durwood that we asked him to join us.  We would highly recommend staying at his place.  The location cannot be beat and his hospitality is top notch."
1252740,11586207,2014-04-08,819721,Susan,"What a terrific find this was for us!   First, the location is wonderful. The neighborhood is filled with great restaurants and small shops.  Try the Blue Star for breakfast , lunch and an afternoon beer. We did all three! There is easy access to the downtown area and the highways from here as well. Off street parking in the driveway made things very simple and access to the house was easy.  If you don't want to drive around town, Durwood offers guests free bus passes
.Don't let the photo fool you, this is a pretty good size house and only about 7 years old.  The guest room and private bath are on the second floor and most comfortable.  The bed is good, the bathroom has an excellent shower with good water pressure.  There is plenty of room to stow your clothes and lots of closet space.
Durwood is a lovely host.  He is warm and personable and makes you feel like you are visiting a friend.  There is make your own coffee in the morning and a nice dining area where you can sit and eat.  We did carryout salads from a local QFC one night and felt right at home setting up at the table. 
I thought the rental was an excellent value and would not hesitate to stay there in the future. We chose this rental because it is two blocks from our sons' home and now that we have found it, we will plan to visit more often. ."
1252740,13052598,2014-05-18,15305899,Robert B,"This could not have been a better Airbnb experience than it was, and Durwood was the greatest host! What a wonderful introduction to the experience.

The house is fairly new and cozy, and the accommodations have some terrific amenities. I felt totally comfortable there. The location is ideal, whether you want to take a walk around Green Lake (highly recommended) or explore some of the shops along 45th. Very easy to catch a bus to wherever you want to go, too, especially to downtown, Ballard, the U-District, and Capitol Hill.

Durwood remained gracious and easygoing from start to finish. He was flexible and cool with everything, and shared his house as though you were a visiting friend. Chill and very easy to get along with.

I would definitely stay here again, and hope to do so when the time comes."
1252740,13221566,2014-05-22,7433793,Peggi,"We loved our stay here. The only thing we wish was different, was having more time to spend getting to know Durwood. He was so kind and willing to make our stay a good one.  We were busy babysitting our grandson, so much of our time was with family.  Our room was great... bed, TV and space for everything. The bathroom was nice with toiletries provided. Parking so convenient and location was perfect for us. We felt completely comfortable and  look forward to staying here again."
1252740,13286623,2014-05-24,2915408,Jennifer,"I only stayed one night. I was very disappointed that instead of getting a good night sleep after a long flight and before my birthday, I had to search for a hotel. The neighborhood intersection was busy constantly. By 2am, I gave up. 
Durwood was kind enough to offer a refund. He said noones ever complained. Honestly that is hard to believe and even if they hadn't, He Lives There! It's nonstop! I have seen other posts that mention street noise and I didn't stay there. He said he'd mention the noise in his posts, so I guess lesson learned. 
It completely changed my trip. "
1252740,13704222,2014-06-02,15305899,Robert B,"This was my second time staying with Durwood, and I would simply say the same great things about it: a wonderful host, a comfortable place to stay with lots of amenities, and a good location for traveling to and from. Highly recommended!"
1252740,14103764,2014-06-11,15305899,Robert B,"I've stayed with Durwood three times now, and, each time, it's been a total pleasure. A lovely room in a nice house with a great host. Can't beat that!"
1252740,14214579,2014-06-14,16641804,Gary,"I was there for two nights and had a great experience.  The location was perfect.  Close to the Woodland Park Zoo, Fremont, 10 mins to downtown, right on the bus line and walking distance to the Wallingford neighborhood for coffee in the morning (although Durwood always had good coffee available). Durwood is a very considerate and kind host and I enjoyed our conversations.  He responded quickly to any txts/questions.  The room is very clean, comfortable and private.  I would stay there again if I traveled back to Seattle."
1252740,14476597,2014-06-20,15450656,Nelson,"The room was very clean, neat, and comfortable.  The location was also convenient for transit and food.  Most important of all, Durwood is an excellent host who is friendly and helpful.  I would certainly be happy to choose the room again when I'm travelling to Seattle."
1252740,14693784,2014-06-24,1455087,Catherine,"I reserved Durwood's private room for my father who was in town visiting me. From everything my dad said and from meeting Durwood and touring his home on the first night, the place was exactly as I expected - new, clean, well-maintained, convenient, etc. My dad said the shower was really nice too. Durwood offered to let my dad use his computer, which was very generous. He was extremely hospitable, letting us in later in the evening and being very friendly and accommodating. "
1252740,15422412,2014-07-08,17042480,Harold,"Durwood is a wonderful host.  The room was very clean, and the attached bathroom was clean and nicely decorated.  Durwood answered every question and made me feel right at home.  Given this was my first experience with Airbnb, I will say I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The home is next to downtown Wallingford, very convenient to downtown or the university.  Restaurants are close by, and Durwood was happy to point me in the right direction.  Durwood responded to all my text messages right away.  I couldn't have asked for anything more.  "
1252740,15544468,2014-07-11,1647596,Joel,"Durwood is a fantastic, friendly host. His house is lovely and in a great location, just a few blocks from the great restaurants on 45th St in Wallingford and about a 15 minute walk from quirky Fremont. The room itself is very comfortable. Durwood knows a great deal about Seattle and made our trip so much better with suggestions. If we go back to Seattle we'd stay with him again for sure. "
1252740,15826186,2014-07-16,16296823,Candy,Durwood was a great host.  He was welcoming and friendly.  He was there when we had questions but was never pushy or to intrusive.  Very accommodating. The house was very nice and in a great location if you want to see the city.  There was some city noise but I did not find that it interfered with my sleep. The house was clean but homey. We would  stay with Durwood again if we visited Seattle.
1252740,16212062,2014-07-23,16790159,Diana,"Durwood was very accommodating - he even worked from home on the day that my boyfriend and I were scheduled to arrive so that he would be at home and have our room ready at the time of our arrival. He was very kind and respectful of our space. The bedroom was clean with new sheets, pillows, and towels included. The connecting bathroom was great!  It had two entrances, one which led into the bedroom and one which led into the computer room which Durwood had said we could use freely. 

The neighborhood was very convenient. My boyfriend and I had arrived in Seattle to attend an event at Seattle Center and Durwood had 2 bus passes ready for us with enough fare included for the entire weekend. With the bus stop only a 2 minute walk away, this was a great incentive for us to stay at his place.

We had read a previous review on how the noise had been a big negative and, honestly, we slept soundly every night. It's very true you can hear cars going by on the nearby freeway but it was nothing that will keep you up unless you know that you are a very -very- light sleeper.

Would we recommend Durwood to our friends? Yes! Would we stay with Durwood again if given the chance? Definitely! 

He went above and beyond what we expected and really made our first experience using airbnb an awesome one :) "
1252740,16500142,2014-07-28,11873481,Benjamin,"Durwood's place was everything we expected and more. Durwood is super friendly and relaxed, and made us feel as though we were friendly guests staying over for a few nights. He provided very clear instructions, and the room was just as described - large, clean and bright with an equally clean adjacent washroom with all the required soaps and towels. One very nice bonus was the prepaid bus cards which we took advantage of. This made getting around the city a breeze. 

The location was also fantastic. Steps away from many shops, restaurants and cafés. 

Also - Durwood's was fully equipped with great wifi, and an astonishingly simple to use TiVo, and DVD player in the room (with  a helpful guest Netflix account).

Absolutely great place to stay!"
1252740,16908570,2014-08-04,15652207,Allie,"Durwood was a wonderful host, and he made us feel at home in Seattle.  The room was clean and comfortable, and we enjoyed the view.  We didn't have a car, so it was really useful to be close to a bus stop and to have a bus pass (provided by Durwood).  We also liked being able to walk to the Wallingford and Fremont neighborhoods with fun restaurants and good gelato!  We would definitely stay here again.  "
1252740,17068017,2014-08-06,10564951,Cristy,"I had a great stay at Durwood's house (2 nights). The room is comfortable and clean, the host is friendly and interesting, and the location is convenient. The bus passes were incredibly helpful! Props for the good variety of pillows too :) The only downside for light sleepers is that there is a bit of traffic noise, but it didn't bother me once I closed the windows. I would definitely stay here again."
1252740,17631839,2014-08-15,18084350,Tuomas,"We stayed four nights at Durwood's place. From the very beginning, we felt welcome in this beautiful and conveniently located home. The lovely neighbourhood is filled with great restaurants within a short walking distance and feels very safe. Trips downtown were effortless with the rapid E bus line, the bus stop located very close to the house. The WiFi was best we've encountered during our trip.

In addition to being a friendly and generous host, Durwood gave us good advice about the city. We enjoyed our time here, and will definitely opt for staying with Durwood again next time when coming to Seattle."
1252740,17866388,2014-08-18,5423866,Gina,"Durwood was a lovely host. His home is centrally located near Woodland Park and the Zoo, great restaurants in Fremont and Wallingford, and on the major bus lines. He was very kind and hospitable, charming with our baby, and generous with his time. The room is a nice size with an ensuite bath. Durwood was kind enough to allow us to use his office space (adjacent to and accessible through the connecting bathroom) to put our baby to sleep in our travel crib, which was a big help for us - in a hotel it's lights out at 7:30pm! The street can be a little noisy with the windows open, but we all slept just fine. He has a nicely appointed large kitchen and dining area which he welcomed us to use as well. We would definitely stay here again!"
1252740,17938294,2014-08-19,2984572,Loretta,"Staying at Durwood's was a treat.
He readily shared his knowledge of Seattle and had great recommendations for places to explore and eat at.
We truly appreciated that Durwood had transit passes for us to use.
"
1252740,18583047,2014-08-28,1029336,Ben,"This stay was way above expectations. Durwood has clearly put considerable effort into arranging things to make guests comfortable.  The “extras”, including use of a city bus pass, choice of luxury bathing products, and an easy-going attitude to using his coffee etc were considerable. Durwood is a nice friendly guy but if you don’t feel like talking he will respect that. He made some really good suggestions for us about where to eat, and interesting places to visit. 

Downsides?  the only one…..as we were staying in one of Seattle’s rare heat waves we had to choose between road noise and a hot bedroom due to closed window – not a major problem and not usually a problem at all I would imagine. 
"
1252740,18801614,2014-09-01,17810899,Margaret,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Durwood's for a couple nights this past weekend and we had a great experience!  Absolutely no complaints.  I really can't imagine staying somewhere better.

Durwood was so helpful and extremely generous throughout our entire stay.  He was more than accommodating and welcoming, and we felt very at ease in his home.  The room was equipped with everything we could possibly need, and the house itself is in such a convenient location.  I will definitely look into staying with Durwood again in the future."
1252740,18949755,2014-09-03,18908062,Anita,"Staying with Durwood was a wonderful experience. Our room and the house was lovely and clean and had everything we would need for our stay. He was also very helpful in letting us know about local spots to eat and things to see which we really appreciated. We always felt welcome and staying with Durwood felt like you were visiting your cool uncle- warm, friendly, easy to talk to with lots of cool stories to be shared and willing to help if you need anything. 

I would highly recommend staying with Durwood, it really was great to be hosted by someone who has a genuine interest in their guests and want to make sure you have a good time whilst in Seattle!"
1252740,19297055,2014-09-09,2910641,Al,"Durwood was a great host. He made is home most accessible to my partner and I & provided great tips on where to eat, what to check out, and how to get around. The room itself was spacious, very clean, and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was immaculate, with a full bath, shower, and essential items. Durwood went out of his way to make us feel welcome and ensure that we enjoyed our visit to Seattle. We would most definitely stay with him again and recommend his place to others.   "
1252740,19499581,2014-09-13,3444252,Lee,"Staying with Durwood was killer! He's a genuine person with a really laid back personality. 

Upon arrival, I was greeted at the door with a warm welcome. He showed me around the house and where I'd be sleeping. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on! 

When I went to take a shower the next morning, there were incredibly soft, oversized bathroom towels to use. Also, 2 bars of brand new soap to choose from! Score! 

And checkout was a breeze—Durwood offered to let me leave my bags there until I was done meeting with my client at 5pm, so I went back to the house after work, freshened up before my 3 hour drive back home, and left feeling VERY satisfied with my stay. 

I really wish I could have stayed longer, but, alas, another guest was coming to stay. Maybe again in the future, though!"
1252740,19959148,2014-09-21,20777774,Rebecca,"Durwood is a warm and gracious host who seems to have an through knowledge of his city. He made me feel welcome and provided information about local restaurants, history and my particular interests. I found his home very comfortable and just as described. The neighborhood mostly residential, with a quaint ""downtown"" area of restaurants and shops very nearby.
  The private bedroom has a full-sized bed (very comfy), a closet with a dresser, and a chair and nightstand. The private bath is clean and well-appointed, with extras that speak of the host's thoughtfulness.
  As a woman traveling alone I felt safe , and would recommend this home-away-from-home to anyone. 
"
1252740,21370459,2014-10-15,522363,Eric,"I was very pleased to have stayed here for three weeks in late September and early October.  The house is very nice, its location is convenient to buses running downtown and to UW, and Durwood is a pleasant host.  The bedroom has a quality bed and attached private bathroom.  The bus pass (Durwood provides one guest bus pass with the room) was really nice, not to have to worry about digging for correct change when boarding the bus.  I also enjoyed occasionally watching news shows with Durwood in the evening.  There's sufficient privacy if/when you want it.  Highly recommended."
1252740,21608868,2014-10-20,21818008,Mary,Durwood made us feel most welcome  -- he is a wonderful host.  The location of the house was perfect for us and the bus passes were most welcome.  The home is very warm and inviting and our suite was very comfortable. Durwood had great suggestions for restaurants and it is clear that he knows and cares for the neighborhood.
1252740,22296092,2014-11-03,20726592,Matthew,"Durwood is the most gracious host you could ever imagine, and his location & amenities are excellent. If you didn't plan every minute of your trip, whatever you are looking to do, with 35 years in Seattle, Durwood is the ultimate concierge. Also, the public transit stop is literally across the street, so we did not rent a car. After the fact, I still say the car was not needed. The bus passes Durwood provides are great and make using the transit system very convenient. Highest recommendation we can give. When I'm back in the city, I hope the room is available."
1252740,24378828,2014-12-27,6379548,Felicia,"Durwood was an exemplary host. His place is clean, comfortable, and convenient to bus stop (he provides guests with Orca cards even) and he is most open and friendly. He is generous, flexible and understanding. He let us leave our belongings in the room we stayed in when we took a 3 day break to go to Vancouver. During our absence, he laundered the sheets and towels for us. On the last evening of our stay, my husband had food poisoning or stomach flu, and Durwood was most understanding. He gave us OTC meds so we could try to get on our flight home and kept the place open for us in case we needed to cancel our flight and stay an extra day. He could not be more accommodating during our stay. By the time we left, Durwood felt more like a friend than just an Airbnb host."
1252740,28451289,2015-03-23,9196571,Alana,"An all around great experience, my boyfriend and I both wish we could've stayed longer! Our flight into Seattle was cancelled and then rescheduled a day later than planned, so our 2-night stay was shortened to just 1 night. Durwood refunded us for the night we missed without any hassle and was very accommodating. He's in general a very kind and generous host! He helped us with transport, directions, and had some great restaurant recommendations. Also, the room was clean and well-equipped with everything we needed. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others!"
1252740,28828463,2015-03-30,29413397,Connie,"My son and I spent the weekend in Seattle and we needed to be near the University. Prior to our arrival I found our Durwood to be helpful with information and most accommodating.  His house was comfortably decorated, clean and very welcoming. The proximity to shopping and eating was appreciated.  Thank you for being ""you"" and we will certainly return. Connie& Luca"
1252740,29085206,2015-04-03,29292407,Kimo,"Very nice new house (not a townhouse) and in a good neighborhood.  As described in the listing and Durwood was a very good host.  

As others have mentioned, there is some traffic noise and, for large folks like me (6'5"") the bed was on the small side.

Durwood was great in getting us in on very short notice - thanks again."
1252740,30032315,2015-04-16,5375310,Asia,The listing was accurate -- the neighborhood was perfect and Durwood was an excellent host.  The room was comfortable with its adjoining bathroom.  Durwood was accommodating and very flexible about check out time.
1252740,30897240,2015-04-28,30314681,Arthur,The experience was great.  Very friendly and accommodating.  We had all the amenities that were needed.  We would certainly stay there again and recommend others to stay there as well
1252740,31961984,2015-05-12,3276201,Nick,"Durwood was an excellent host for my mother who was visiting. She had no complaints about his place and enjoyed the extra touches (like the deluxe local soaps provided). The room was clean, bed comfortable, and bath immaculate. No complaints.

"
1252740,32628420,2015-05-19,33060154,Meaghan,"I really enjoyed my stay with Durwood- the house was in an awesome location, was clean and comfortable, and Durwood was a great host! He left us an extremely helpful packet of information about the house and the area, and made us feel welcome for the duration of our stay."
1252740,33150858,2015-05-25,4910495,Hannah,"The home was lovely and in the perfect location around the Fremont/Greenlake area. 
Walking distance from many local restaurants, the zoo, and major Seattle attractions.
The room was clean and included both bathroom amenities and even Netflix!!!!"
1252740,33860221,2015-06-01,30977160,Tim,"Durwood's place was excellent! The room and private bath were both super comfortable, clean, and very reasonably priced. The neighborhood is very walkable, and close to tons of good restaurants, bars, and several bus lines that will get you all over the city. 

Durwood himself is a pretty great fellow, gracious host, and just all around good guy. He is one of those people that you instantly feel comfortable around, and he is a whole lot of fun to talk with. I just can't say enough good things about him. I would without a doubt recommend staying with Durwood during your next trip to Seattle. "
1252740,34836252,2015-06-12,35280240,Sasha,"Durwood was an excellent host.  He got the room prepped on extremely short notice, and was super helpful in helping us get settled and finding our feet in the neighborhood, so heed his recommendations and it will suit you well :).  The room itself was very comfortable with its own shower, and Durwood did a wonderful job of providing amenities that made me feel a little like staying in a hotel.  Most importantly, though, Durwood is a really nice guy and great conversation."
1252740,35152677,2015-06-15,23134110,Chuck,"My stay at Durwood's home was very nice. I had a very full weekend taking, part in a training and development program. So I didn't have much time to visit. I did have the opportunity to hangout with Durwood Friday evening. He is a very welcoming host and his home is well taken care of. He's conveniently located next to the Fremont area, which is where my training took place. I would definitely stay at Durwood's home again. "
1252740,36315539,2015-06-27,35435208,Magnus,Durwood made us feel very welcome at his house. Communication worked great and the location of the house is perfect to visit Seattle.
1252740,36956036,2015-07-03,32225078,Lisa,This was our very first Airbnb stay. It was comfortable and our host was very accommodating and friendly. Durwood even dug out his old bass guitar and amp because he knew I played.  Great advise on where to go out to eat in the neighborhood and great location.  Thanks Durwood!  Lisa and Rob.
1252740,37573698,2015-07-08,33370103,Matt,"Durwood was a fantastic host, he knows and loves Seattle and helped find our way around. We had thorough communication leading up to and during our visit, and knew exactly what to expect when we arrived. 

The room itself was private, clean, and comfortable as was the rest of Durwood's house. The neighborhood is safe, walkable,  and perfectly located for taking Seattle's public transit anywhere in the city. Durwood also provided us with bus passes! 

We had a great time in Seattle and our stay with Durwood greatly contributed to the experience."
1252740,38866904,2015-07-19,6897298,Leeanne,"Durwood was a super friendly and wonderful host! He definitely had an eye for detail with the soaps in the bathroom and ORCA cards, and it was easy to feel right at home. The neighborhood is cute and being close to the E line made getting around super quick! I would definitely stay with him again."
1252740,40098033,2015-07-28,7915542,Sacha,"Durwood has a lovely home and made us extremely welcome. After a couple of days it felt like we were staying with an old friend. 

The room was very comfortable had everything could have wished for and the use of the neighbouring study with computer and printer access was a real bonus for our extended trip.  (Great movie collection too.)

Although a few miles from downtown Seattle, Durwood provides Orca cards for his guests and the E line bus goes from right outside to whisk you into town.  That said the neighbourhood itself is lovely with great restaurants and coffee bars. Don't miss the amazing Bizzaro Italian restaurant, just round the corner. Plus it was simple to get to Fremont to hire some bicycles for a lovely ride along the Burke Gilman trail.

The only advisory I would give is that it is near a main road so in warm weather (that we were fortunate to have) leaving the windows open was a little noisy. This didn't bother us but if you are sensitive to noise it may do.
We loved our week with Durwood and highly recommend him as a host."
1252740,41223385,2015-08-05,36441322,Dirk,"Great stay.  I was attending Landmark training, and this incredibly convenient for it as well as minutes from downtown.  Derwood was a very congenial host. Fabulous kitchen. Natural organic amenities in the bathroom fantastic. I used to live in Seattle, in his knowledge of the area is fabulous. Ninjas 10 blocks from the Woodland Park zoo is fantastic. Also close to Greenway. Derwood provides bus pass which can get you anywhere you want to go quickly without having to pay parking fees. I highly recommend."
1252740,43556521,2015-08-20,27046570,Ian,"If you're visiting Seattle, Stay Here. Durwood is an amazing host, and after using AirB&B in many places, Durwood made you feel like this was equally your house also. He is a fount-of-knowledge and the house location is minutes away from downtown via express bus. (He even provides bus passes to help you get around) If you're up to it you can even walk the 3 miles.  Since it's just out of downtown it has it own little village feel, with lots of shops at the end of the road for you to pick up supplies. Overall: Great host, great house and great city.  

I repeat once again, stay here you will not regret it."
1252740,44123362,2015-08-24,36076625,Matthew,"Durwood was a wonderful host with a fantastic home.  The room was better than its description, especially the extras like toiletries and the bus passes.  The location was perfect.  Durwood provided lots of useful info and suggestions, was very friendly and easygoing and respected our privacy. Things could not have gone better! Would love to stay with him again."
1252740,44639106,2015-08-28,4213392,Stephanie,"My partner and I stayed with Durwood for three nights. We found the bedroom and residence comfortable. The bus, which is about a 5 min walk, is convenient to downtown and the train line to the airport. Another plus is that the bedroom is next door to an office which Durwood let us use, and it has a printer and computer. Durwood's  location is also lgbt-friendly. We had a good stay and would recommend."
1252740,46121790,2015-09-08,9743083,Martin,"Durwood was interesting and interested.  Very easy to talk to, charming and helpful."
1252740,47104833,2015-09-15,43307964,Lorenzo,"We are new to Airbnb (this was only our second stay) and we were extremely pleased with the experience. Durwood has a very cozy and impeccable house, our room was spotless. Durwood is a very friendly and outgoing person and he made us feel right at home. We very much enjoyed talking with him while sharing a cup of coffee in the kitchen. We would strongly recommend Durwood and his very comfortable home."
1252740,47978740,2015-09-22,39866478,John,"My wife and I highly recommend this place:  very friendly and welcoming host, great location, and comfortable room. Our daughter lives nearby and we intend to return soon for another visit. When we do, this is where we want to stay again!"
1252740,48901320,2015-09-29,457470,Ann,"Though Durwood was at work when I arrived, he was a great communicator and, through emails and a phone call, his directions and description of how to get in the house were excellent. I let myself in and immediently felt at home. Put my things up in my bedroom and took a few things down to the refrigerator. I felt very much at ease in the home.

The room was very private and bed was SO comfortable, the mattress and wonderful Egyptian cotton sheets. Nicely appointed private bath too.

Loved the neighborhood. Very walkable. For my first dinner I treated myself to one of the best meals I've ever had just five blocks down the street.

I was in Seattle for a weekend workshop and after a full day's workshop and a dinner out, I'd come home, find Durwood in the living room and we'd have a nice chat, further making me feel at home. Very relaxed, great host.

Next time I'm in Seattle, I'd happily stay with Durwood in his comfy home.
"
1252740,49712276,2015-10-05,45077733,Lisa,"Home was modest but comfortable and convenient. This was my first trip to Seattle and my first AirBnb experience. I purposely wanted to avoid staying in the downtown area to enjoy a more neighborhood feel. Durwood was a wonderful! He knew I wanted to explore more natural aspects of the city and left guide books for me. He was personable, knowledgeable about Seattle and very accommodating. "
1252740,51250121,2015-10-18,46626711,Badr,"Best host, helpful and understanding in every way. Recommend to anybody visiting Seattle. "
1252740,52055415,2015-10-26,37267714,Kirsa,"Durwood is the best host anyone could ask for. The location and home were perfect, it is convenient to so many places in Seattle and walking distance to the best shops and local restaurants. We felt right at home the moment we walked into the house.  There is no doubt that this will be the place we will stay again next time we are in Seattle."
1252740,57146170,2015-12-22,49641708,Hoover,"From the moment of the online reservation to the end of our stay, Durwood was responsive and professional. We had issues in terms of arriving on time and he was more than accommodating. Hospitable and amiable, Durwood is the perfect AirBnB host. Location is perfect, since EVERYTHING is literally less than 10 mins away. ""Live as if you were my room mates."" Hope we were A-Okay!"
3543084,27117057,2015-02-25,11556788,Mateo,Amy was able to accommodate us at a moment notice. The location an amazing sunset view. My wife and I loved looking out the window as we were getting ready to go out in the middle of downtown Seattle. The welcome was like a home and the quality was like a highly rated hotel. 
3543084,31055658,2015-05-01,2608256,Gary,Check in was easy and convenient. Upon check in I was greeted by a property representative  who showed me around the property and answered questions. The property was as described and clean. It is in great location. I would definitely reserve this property again.
9516608,54954348,2015-11-25,38195722,Mike,House was very nice.  Lots of room.  It was an easy walk to a co-op grocery store and a Trader Joes.  Chuck's hop stop with a huge selection of beer was even closer.  The trolley bus to downtown stopped at the end of the street.  Owners were responsive and accommodating.  All and all a great place.
9460,8715,2009-08-31,32825,Serena,"The room was very cozy and clean, much like your own master bedroom at home. The bathroom was stocked with towels, toiletries, all the amentities one would need.  The owner was VERY attentive to the needs of her guests and always replenished the drinks, fruit, and used utensils and flatware very promptly. The place is near the the I-5 freeway, so freeway traffic can be heard unless the windows are shut all the way. All in all, a very reasonable deal."
9460,9669,2009-09-10,36769,Elise,"This was a great alternative to an impersonal hotel room. The bed is really cushy, there is fun art everywhere, and the cutest kitchenette has everything you could possibly need. We had complete privacy for three days, and we definitely appreciated Siena's note with restaurant recommendations and information about the area. We would stay here again, anytime we would want a central location with great amenities and style.   "
9460,54292,2010-06-18,86240,Gregg,This was the perfect location for me to stay during a two week class in Seattle.  I had all the privacy I needed and everything was comfortable.  I had the option to be there the entire time without ever seeing my hostess but I chose to get to know her instead.  She was quick to pick up on my interests and I found some unexpected goodies by my door from time to time that proved she's a good listener and hostess.  
9460,64350,2010-07-13,110180,Natasha,"Siena was very welcoming, friendly, and accommodating. The room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated and you can't beat the location. I strongly recommend this room to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable place to stay in downtown Seattle!"
9460,67478,2010-07-22,27082,Luna,"One of my best B&B experiences by far. Siena wrote detailed instructions on anything I could ever need, plus she provided food, water, toiletries, and lots of bonus things once I got there. The room itself was lovely and a short walk to Benaroya Hall, the convention center, and the rest of downtown. I was very happy to stay here and would rent the room again in a heartbeat!"
9460,73787,2010-08-04,184142,Karen,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and it couldn't have turned out any better. The space is extremely comfortable, and a very short walk to the downtown. Little goodies were left for us, and the one night we had difficulties with the internet, it was fixed by the next morning! Siena was so responsive, and was a pleasure to work with, though we never even met her. I would definitely return!"
9460,79312,2010-08-16,12386,Adrian,"Siena is wonderful and organized.  You don't have to worry about anything staying here.  The room is comfortable, homey, and well stocked.  We were here for a week and would recommend Siena's place to others."
9460,82967,2010-08-23,131025,Celia,"Siena was a great hostess; I only talked to her once.
She paid attention at all our requests/needs. We had no problem at all. 
The room was a bit small. We had two big luggages and 2 smaller ones - it was hard to move around the room when they were open.
Except that, everything was great, it is a real good value. Well located, next to downtown and Capitol Hill (lots of great restaurants and small shops - don't miss ""odd fellows""). There is also a bus stop not far from the building.
And if you come by greyhound bus (as we did from Vancouver), it is also very close (10 minutes walk).
If I could, I would have evaluated my experience to 4,5 stars!
"
9460,86570,2010-08-29,191958,Roy,Siena was an awesome host! Room was beautiful and comfortable and she attended to my requests quickly! Much appreciated!
9460,89299,2010-09-02,99711,Tess,"This was my first airbnb stay and Siena set the bar very high. The building was safe and quiet, the room was very comfortable and charming, and the snacks were a nice bonus. Everything was above my expectations and far better than a hotel. I was very happy to stay here and would recommend Siena's place to all!"
9460,91035,2010-09-06,174818,Joyce,"More than I could have asked for! Everything was very clean and comfortable. There was a ton of fresh food (yogurt, juice, toast, cereal, milk, fruit, and even some wine) that you don't have to pay extra for. The location is great as well. It's 2 blocks from the convention and only one block over from Capitol Hill. Tons better than a hotel in my opinion! Thanks so much!"
9460,98420,2010-09-16,216484,Russell,"Our accommodations and hospitality were terrific.  She provided good ""tourist"" info--getting around, recommended restaurants, etc. Great location, wonderful, comfortable run.  We'll be back!"
9460,105174,2010-09-26,151395,Nitthita,"The location is just perfect for me since it is so close to the convention center where my conference was.  The room is situated on a quiet and peaceful road which makes it easier for me to fall asleep and combat with my jet lag.  

Inside the room, there are plenty of drink, juice, cereal... This is very nice because the guests can just grasp something to eat according to their own schedule. The bedroom and the bathroom are very clean and tidy.  Great privacy is another great point.  I would stay here again if I have a chance to come back here in Seattle.  

Thank you Seina for providing such a perfect place with a reasonable price.  Oh I do have just one reccommendation.  It would be nice to have a set of slipper offered inside the room.

"
9460,127368,2010-10-25,243579,Gerry,The host canceled my reservation 3 days before arrival.
9460,127734,2010-10-26,252303,Erica,The accommodations were exactly as described. The location was fabulous and so much more comfortable than staying in a hotel. Siena provided a lot of very helpful information. The whole process was dead simple. And we had a great time in Seattle to boot!
9460,144569,2010-11-25,290737,Talia,"Siena was very responsive and helpful when making the reservation.  

My friends stayed for a few nights and they found that Siena's place was cozy and very well situated in town.  The breakfast she left was delicious and more than enough food for their stay.  They appreciated the linens and the cleanliness of the room.  The only thing was that the room was a tiny bit cold - but their visit was so busy that they didn't have time to tell me (so I could tell Siena) until after they had checked out.

This was my first experience with airbnb and it was really smooth.  Siena offered as much assistance as she could - we're sorry we didn't get to meet her."
9460,165186,2011-01-04,292632,Julia,"Great experience!  Clean and comfortable.  Perfect location.  Couple blocks from downtown.  Walk to Capitol Hill and Pikes Market.  Hostess exceptionally kind, easy to deal with and attentive.  Highly recommended.  "
9460,182913,2011-02-15,243023,Allie,"I had a wonderful experience at Siena's B&B.  Cute, super clean, very comfortable, fully equipped and in a perfect location.  She was so sweet and checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed.  Highly recommended!  Thanks Siena!  ;)"
9460,188320,2011-02-25,330866,Christine,I would highly recommend this B&B to anyone visiting in the downtown/Capitol Hill area of Seattle.  Siena was a responsive and gracious hostess and provided everything I needed for a very comfortable stay.
9460,193856,2011-03-07,380916,Andrew,"I stayed at Siena's place a while back and have been remiss in not writing her review sooner. She is awesome, although I hardly ever saw her and the place is great. Its my favorite Seattle spot. It seems its everyone else's too now because its getting hard to book! :)"
9460,204432,2011-03-21,340788,Boyd,"The apartment is comfortable,very clean, and private, snug but well appointed.  There is an alcove containing a refrigerator well stocked with breakfast supplies and even some wine for later in the day. 
My wife and I  never saw out host Sienna, although she was most obliging, through email and messages under our door, to accommodate whatever requests we had.  There is no phone in the apartment, a bit of a problem for those of us luddites without a cell phone; but again, Sienna made telephone reservations for us, took messages, etc. We found out upon our return home that Sienna has a cell phone that she is happy to loan out to guests, but we never thought to ask. The apartment is very conveniently located. Being downtown, it inevitably has some traffic noise, although that is not noticeable with the windows closed; and apparently the windows can be adjusted when open to cut down on noise.  This was not necessary during our stay in March. All in all we would recommend this venue.  "
9460,211876,2011-03-29,341920,Crystal,"What a WONDERFUL experience.
I had never used airbnb before, but Siena was an absolutely amazing host and the location was perfect.  We had a conference at the Seattle convention center and this was about as close as you can get for less than half the cost of a hotel.  Not only were we close to the conference, but we were close to the pier, aquarium, and pike's place market as well as the monorail and most downtown attractions.

Siena was very nice and helpful from the time we booked and throughout our stay.  Not only does she give you a place to stay but there was delicious food, clean linens, a comfy bed and pillows, and a parking pass (which saves a TON of cash in downtown Seattle). She also checked in and made sure we had everything we needed, plus she offered to pick up additional things from the store for us.

I can't thank Siena enough and would HIGHLY recoommend her to anybody.  Robert and I look forward to staying here on our next visit to Seattle."
9460,214935,2011-04-02,322774,Anne,"Accomodations were clean and spacious enough for me. I think if there were 2 people, it would get a bit crowded. I loved the little kitchenette nook and the snacks Siena left. I emailed her before my arrival, and asked for some favorites (green tea, muffins, skim milk) and they were all available when I arrived. 

You get your private bathroom, which is not off the bedroom but off the common hallway. There were plenty of towels and basic bath items.

What I loved the most is that Siena made me feel welcome even before I got there. She was great in sending emails before my trip to make sure I have the information I need. Thanks to her, I took the lightrail to and from the airport, which was much cheaper than taking a shuttle, and found a nice little crepe place right down the street by the Convention Center. "
9460,229448,2011-04-18,265462,Jeff,"The accommodations were fabulous, the location highly convenient, and the price more than fair. I would highly recommend staying with Siena, and will certainly make reservations here the next time I visit Seattle. "
9460,240572,2011-04-26,421821,Justin,I very much enjoyed my stay it is very close to the Washington conference center. Highly recommend and I will probably be booking another stay there sometime in the future.
9460,245579,2011-04-30,61163,Jennifer,"Siena is a fabulous host and the room is super cozy and very conveniently located. There were so many personal touches that made the experience so great: detailed email and printed instructions and directions, fully stocked mini-fridge with snacks and beverages to enjoy at anytime of the day, high-speed internet and cable TV/DVDs, clean room and bathroom and super comfy bed and pillows. I highly recommend staying with Siena!"
9460,250890,2011-05-04,386044,Ooo,A wonderful experience.  Sienna also checked in with me during my stay to make sure all was okay.  I would stay here again.
9460,275715,2011-05-23,331081,Luis,Excellent choice. I recommend.
9460,284548,2011-05-28,459707,Laurie,"The location of this condo is great - a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, near the Convention Center, and extremely walkable. The host was extremely on top of her game - checking in prior to and during our stay, through emails and notes under the door, providing a basket of cookies and milk, as well as champagne upon arrival. Instructions were easy to understand, the bed was comfortable, there is a variety of DVDs made available, as well as breakfast items. After a few days the living quarters were a bit tight for 2 people + suitcases and we Sienna offered for us to use the hall closet. Other than that, everything was great and we were very satisfied with our experience. "
9460,290124,2011-05-31,501113,Malory,"My husband and I had a WONDERFUL stay at Siena's. This was our first ever experience with AirBNB, and it was great! Siena was wonderful and left us lots of great goodies- it really made our experience feel more comfortable.  
Pros- great price, fantastic downtown/capital hill location, comfortable, great bed, delicious treats, homey
Cons- bathroom not directly connected to room (not an issue for us, but just wanted to let you know!), smaller room (again, didn't matter for us, we we spent most of our time out and about!)
I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone considering staying. We had a wonderful time. Thanks Siena!"
9460,306256,2011-06-10,330330,Laura,"Not only was this place in a perfect location and felt like being in a hotel suite... My husband and I were on a budget for our wedding anniversary, and Siena made it extra special with a bottle of wine and cookies.
:)"
9460,310663,2011-06-13,61606,Sharon,"I can't say enough good things about my stay with Siena.  The place is so conveniently located for going to a convention -- just a couple short blocks and you are there.  There was a lovely assortment of food items in the frig, fresh flowers in both the bedroom and the bathroom, beautiful artwork, lots of attention to detail and comfort.  I especially liked going to the 16th floor roof decks and taking in the view.  I enjoyed fabulous food at nearby restaurants and shopping venues as well.  Head down the hill and you will be at Pike Street Market - great location.  I will be back!"
9460,340910,2011-06-28,454040,Alejandra,"Siena is a great host! She took excellent care of us during our stay in Seattle. She is very organized and professional. She made sure we had everything we needed and was very responsive to all my questions and requests since the moment I contacted her prior to the trip throughout our stay. She was kind enough to accommodate our very late arrival after 2AM. The room is very cozy, and the bed and mattress are very comfortable. 

The location is good, right on Pike street, main downtown area, and less than 10 blocks walking distance from the Market area.

I certainly recommend Siena's place. Thank you for making our stay in Seattle a great experience!
Alex and Onix

9460,350833,2011-07-04,325992,Gary M.,"Marvelous facility, excellently furnished with breakfast choices, beverages and other amenities; landlady was most accommodating.  Wound definitely stay here again our next visit to Seattle.  Would highly recommend!  Thank you, Siena!"
9460,361555,2011-07-09,373664,Connie,"We had a wonderful experience at Siena's place! From the fabulous feng-shui arrangements, to the stocked fridge and free wi-fi, we looked forward to returning to the calming atmosphere of our room! We stayed 5 nights that included the 4th of July (where we watched the downtown fireworks from the rooftop!) and a convention. Our room was about one block from the convention center, shopping (including groceries), and several blocks from other sites. Siena gave us a parking permit to park in front of the building, and that came in quite handy (parking is otherwise hard to find and spendy). We saw Siena occasionally, never saw the housekeeper at all, nor did we hear anybody else in the building. The building has a security entrance, which was also a plus being downtown!

The bed was comfy, outside sound was blocked unless you opened the windows, the room was spacious. The bathroom was outside of the room, but that didn't bother us at all --- we never saw anybody and Siena provided bathrobes for us (the XXL one must be a misprint!).

The snacks consists of muffins with butter, fresh fruit, coffees/teas/beverages, yogurt. There were dishes, silverware, cups/glassware, etc. Lots of towels were made available. There was a place to launder our clothes downstairs (again, didn't see anybody), and when we piled towels/dishes outside, they were returned the next day.

All in all, it was a far better experience than staying in a hotel, and the price was superb! Siena was a great hostess!

Thanks, Siena! When we return to Seattle, we will definitely look you up!

"
9460,376634,2011-07-16,737809,Jack,"We really enjoyed our stay with Siena. She is very considerate and is a great host. She provided excellent instructions about the room and the building.  She also gives you a lot of useful information about what is nearby in terms of restaurants, grocery stores, etc.  The place has everything you need, is very private, and the location is outstanding. The room had teas, coffee, english muffins, and more!  She provides a parking pass so that you can park for free on the street, though I would recommend not renting a car unless you really have to as finding street parking can be difficult at times.  You should have absolutely no hesitation about booking with Siena. "
9460,443086,2011-08-14,555469,Kevin,"Our stay at Siena's was wonderful.  The location is perfect, very close to downtown shopping, restaurants, and public transportation.  There is also a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, little shops directly north. Tango, an awesome little tapas place with great happy hour specials, is only two blocks away!  The suite was smallish but Siena has done a great job maximizing space--we were never in each other's way; we were able to unpack our suitcases and stow away our luggage. The room is beautifully decorated and extremely clean.  We had plenty of towels and hangers, two things you don't think about at home but often find yourself needing more of when on vacation.  The room had a toaster/microwave/ability to make coffee/dishes/wine opener, etc, and a mini fridge with water/juice/milk/crumpets/jam/butter/yogurt.  The room also a had really nice fan and the wireless always worked.  We will definitely stay again next time we visit Seattle."
9460,473971,2011-08-25,802381,Keturah,"Siena provided us with excellent information prior to our stay on what to do in Seattle and how to get to the apartment, as well as additional information about the building (e.g. laundry facilities, dining options etc) once we arrived.
The room was a good size with mini kitchen and wardrobe facilities, with private bathroom just outside the door.
The breakfast (and snack!) options provided were copious and far beyond what we could have managed to eat.
The location is great for exploring the various areas of Seattle - especially if you want to see the areas just east of the city (e.g. Capitol Hill, Broadway), and not just (website hidden) Seattle in general: be aware that traffic is AWFUL - worse than any other city in the US by our experiences (including New York, LA and Chicago, though we have yet to try Boston which is supposed to be the worst). So allow time to get there.  Also you will get a parking permit for street parking but you might have to drive around for a bit to find something and may need to park a few streets away from the building.   This isn't a big issue if you don't have much luggage, but the area is quite hilly, so if you do have lots of luggage, you should probably drop the luggage off first.  It's not an issue, just letting people know so they can't complain afterwards.
Excellent stay - better than a hotel and cheaper too!"
9460,483003,2011-08-29,535547,Trisha,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for PAX, and Siena was an incredible host despite us never seeing her. She printed out the schedule for us ahead of time and provided pretty much everything we could need (there were Q-tips, a spare toothbrush which I needed because I forgot mine =X, lots of bottles of water, fresh raspberries which happen to be my boyfriend's favorite fruit, more stuff than I could list). We also managed to arrange for us to stay later, which meant we didn't have to drag our luggage around past check out, which we really really appreciated.

The place itself is also really nice. The building has this really cool old hotel feeling, like I could see a chic black and white 60s movie filmed there. The main sign glows neon purple/pink at night, and the elevator has these awesome typewriter-like buttons that you press. As for the room, the bed was really comfy and the place is really well decorated. It's also incredibly close to the Convention Center, which was really convenient for us. We'll definitely be staying here again if we come into town next year for PAX!"
9460,497560,2011-09-03,879788,Tom,"I came into Seattle for a week-long conference, and staying at Siena's place was really perfect. The location is perfect for anything at the convention center (but also for just about anything downtown or in Capital Hill, where we went out for dinner/drinks a couple nights, just a ten minute walk away). The accommodations were excellent, the perfect blend of professionalism and the personal touch. Siena had a nice spread set up for us on arrival, including a special bottle of Champagne we used to celebrate. No complaints at all, only that we couldn't stay longer!  "
9460,522913,2011-09-12,796067,Lijie,"The location of the apartment was unbeatable! It was just round the corner from the Convention Center and you could walk to all the attractions downtown easily. Siena was a wonderful host as well! She was very accommodating - I had lots of packages from online purchases sent to her address at different times. It was really sweet of her to collect them on my behalf multiple times :) There was also a very useful list of information prepared for us which brought great convenience to our stay, such as recommended nearby dining places, where to do laundry, where to get groceries etc... I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's going to be in Seattle!"
9460,536031,2011-09-16,92561,Janeen,"Wow, this is a great place to stay!!!  The location is excellent, the room is cozy, with a wonderfully calm color scheme and a very comfy bed.  The bathroom, your private little spa room, is just across the hall.  The room and bathroom are very private and very clean.  There are blackout shades on the windows, which allowed us to sleep so long we missed breakfast hours every day we were there!  So that's the room...now for the host...

Siena is the most Primo Host you will ever find!  She is personable from the moment you are put in touch with her.  She knows her town (and the people in it!) and can give you recommendations for dining and entertainment, which are Top Drawer!  You will not go wrong by staying at Siena's place.  We loved it and highly recommend it. -- Janeen & Mike, Colorado"
9460,628332,2011-10-14,432138,Sava,"Siena is a lovely person - helpful, accommodating, kind, and generous. 

this apartment is perfectly located - not far from the Capitol Hill neighborhood with great bars and food and such; and close to shopping, movies, and the convention center. 

the room was lovely - comfortable, quiet, private. Siena provided everything I needed including coffee and snacks for mornings, and any toiletries I may have forgotten. There was also a parking pass and a GO phone in case I needed that. 

I cannot recommend this location and Siena enough - the transaction was seamless, my stay was perfect, the room, location, amenities, and attention were perfect. 

if you're ever in Seattle, this is the place to stay. without a doubt. "
9460,641753,2011-10-18,998627,Beth,"Siena was a great hostess.  She provided us with a lot of information of things to do in Seattle and what we should see.  The room was clean and was the perfect size for us for the short amount of time we spent in it.  The bathroom had many linens as well as things we might have forgotten, such as band aids, aspirin, toothbrush... etc.  She also provides breakfast necessities and special requests such as soy milk and oatmeal. The location was perfect and kept us within walking distance of many of our daily adventures.   Our flight came in a few hours before check in time and Siena was very accomadating in letting us check in earlier.  My husband and I highly recomment this place to stay for anyone coming to Seattle for a weekend getaway trip.  "
9460,649114,2011-10-21,773290,Mary,"I cannot say enough about my wonderful stay at Siena's. In addition to the comments left by previous guests about all Siena provides, one evening I came back to a delicious and unexpected surprise at my door... Siena had made food to bring to another event and left me a sample. I never saw/heard her nor her housekeeper dduring my entire stay. I only regret not meeting her - maybe next time I stay there. 
As a solo traveler, I felt very safe as well as comfortable. The neighbordood felt very safe with several dog walkers. An enjoyable stroll walking back from some of the very nice nearby restaurant suggestions Siena gives. 
"
9460,665541,2011-10-26,742870,James,"Great stay, great location, very thoughtful and thorough  accomodations by Siena.  

Tango restaurant is great.  Extra note wine is half price on Mondays at Tango.  
"
9460,697385,2011-11-07,934429,Roland,6 out of 5 stars (at least). The location is great - just a few steps away from downtown but at the same time conveniently silent - and Siena is THE best host you can probably imagine. Maybe better.
9460,773454,2011-12-09,1282046,Margo,"Siena's place has it all going on and just about perfect for the exacting budget traveler... The location of the secure building is perfect, right between downtown and Capitol Hill. Clearly she has gone to great pains to ensure one's visit to Seattle is as perfect as you want it to be. From the advance email, to the welcome letter that will be waiting for you, all the details are provided that you will need to take advantage of all Seattle has to offer. It feels as if you are staying with a friend in the B and B industry, but the friend happens to be gone all of the time.... fridge and small organized ""kitchen"" alcove stocked with beer, wine, water, yogurt, crumpets, coffee, fruit, juice, etc...  Small space, there isn't a lot of additional space, but there is an empty hall closed where you are invited to store empty suitcases, etc... The bathroom across the hall is private enough, and adequate, with a decent shower. Seventh floor room is private, safe, convenient and an incredible bargain. Just right for one person, and for the price, not bad for two people who know each other pretty well. Would definitely stay here again! "
9460,851085,2012-01-09,84351,Beth And Scott,"FANTASTIC! Absolutely perfect location for people who have a conference at the Convention Center or Seattle Sheraton. Also very close to good restaurants and a coffee shop that roasts their coffee (Victrola's). I walked everywhere (no car) and all was well, even when it lightly drizzled. Like everyone before me, I was quite pleased and surprised with the amount and quality of food and beverage provided. Arriving at 10pm I was greeted with a glass of wine and lentils that I heated up in the microwave. There is also a toaster for the crumpets, which I discovered I love. I would DEFINITELY stay here again, with or without my husband-- the bed, the location, the amenities, the cleanliness, and the super-cute decor were perfect. Also, she provides a mini guide when you arrive with restaurant recommendations-- very helpful."
9460,899708,2012-02-03,1567154,Ben,"Siena is a amazing host and the location is phenomenal.  You can't go wrong staying here.  It is extremely private, and Siena makes sure to make sure your stay is comfortable and goes above and beyond to make her guests happy.  

I lost the keys...they fell out of my pocket on the Washington State Ferry, which is within walking distance, and Siena did everything she could to make sure that I still had a way to get into the room.  The keys were returned and I never had to pay anything out of pocket.  She also extended my stay which I requested, and made sure that I had more breakfast items to make it through check out.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  

GREAT LOCATION and EVEN BETTER HOST!"
9460,923429,2012-02-15,1663229,Mario,"Siena is a lovely host and her place in Seattle is beautiful. We had a great time in Seattle. Siena is a great host; very attentive and helpful with us while we were there. This place is conveniently located in the downtown area. Walking distance to Pikes market, downtown shopping stores, restaurants, and bars. Public transportation is great. Plenty of things to do in the city. Will definitely be staying here again. "
9460,936118,2012-02-21,368581,Michael,"Excellent host.  The location is perfect, super convenient to everything.  The room is a great place to crash.  I really appreciated the black out shades and the quiet you get once you close the super well insulated windows.  I was pleased to find some muffins and lactose free milk greeting me when I arrived.  Everything went well, I'll definitely stay here again.  "
9460,968231,2012-03-04,1385561,Andrew,"I was attending an event at the convention center and Siena's place looked to be the closest, so I took it purely for its proximity.

However, it turned out to be an amazing place for so many more reasons than its location.

1. Also close to amazing restaurants and the Capitol Hill neighborhood.
2. Siena has this apartment packed with goodies to eat and drink!
3. Quiet.  Concrete walls or something, it was quiet.  Slept well.
4. Siena - your virtual concierge.  Even though she's not there, she checks in by email - and also has done extensive research on every logistical question you might have about Seattle -- all compiled in a handy dandy info packet laying on the desk.  

Will definitely return if I'm ever back in Seattle."
9460,1026764,2012-03-21,1588101,Patricia,"Siena is amazing! The best host Seattle has to offer. I have been visiting Seattle off and on for at least 8 years, this is the best place to stay in all the districts.  Just off Pike, next to the convention center, a block from the new transit tunnel, amazing restaurants and even the theatre just a block away. I didn't even have to use the bus at all.  The place is clean, well decorated, perfect space for a single traveler. The little kitchen space is well  stocked with breakfast goodies, plenty of coffee & tea.  
Oh and did I mention the bed? Best nights sleep I've ever had!. Black out curtains, sound-proof walls, modern artistic decor.Private bath, shower, plenty of towels.
And there is wifi! TV with new cds, current info on what's going on in Seattle.
I'd give it 10 stars easily. Oh and did I mention, Siena is amazing!! 
I'LL BE BACK!

A delicious spread of breakfast options - thank you. A couple of minutes walk to the Convention Centre which was ideal for me. And not too far to Pike Place Market. I highly recommend this accommodation and would stay here again next time I am in Seattle. Thanks Siena. Amy"
9460,1135615,2012-04-16,435309,Damy,"There's only one question for you:  What will you enjoy the most?  Sightseeing in Seattle or this cozy room with every single detail you can think of remembered by Siena (the hostess) and Nadia (the housekeeper.)  
I am an avid traveler and a meticulous, and this was my second stay with Airbnb on a three-city trip.  I must admit, it was a relief to get to Siena's cozy place. She ensures you have everything from extra towels and water, juice and even wine to all bathroom essentials (shampoo, bar soap, a nice bathrobe) and even needle and thread!   I cannot say enough nice things about my stay, nor Siena whom I was very fortunate to meet. She's one of those few people you meet in your life that you'd love to have as a good friend for life. She's warm and friendly, sweet and funny most of all, curious about how your stay is going and how she can make it better.  

Siena even picked up a coat for a friend who had left it at another location in Seattle (about 20 mins away from her place) and mailed it back to NYC Priority Mail.  I can guarantee you, you've never experienced service like this...heck, I haven't received such service at Five Star Hotels!

On a final note, Siena is right when she says it is on a great location.  You're steps away from a bus hub and Pike Place Market is a short walk away.  You also have the Cheesecake Factory and shopping two blocks away.  The apartment is NOT next to the highway as it may appear to you on google maps.  It's an overpass but when you walk to the apartment, it's just like any regular street.

Book today, you won't be disappointed!

9460,1158931,2012-04-21,773290,Mary,"Wonderful stay, never heard another person while in the room. Room well set up for one and ""doable"" for two. Siena has fresh flowers and a well stocked kitchenette waiting for you. Very clear suggestions for activities and restaurants within walking distance await your arrival. The neighborhood is very welcoming & quiet, comfortable for walking, lots of people on the streets so feel very safe. Great hostess and I will return in a heartbeat whenever I need to come to Seattle. Easy to contact Siena if needed during stay.    "
9460,1190362,2012-04-28,1760853,Justin,Lovely stay. Would reserve again in the future without hesitation.
9460,1270062,2012-05-13,1762693,Karen,"We really enjoyed our stay.  Although we didn't see her that much, Siena is the perfect host. Everything you could possibly need is there. I came down with an awful head cold while there and Siena dropped off a natural remedy that really helped!  The room is cozy and beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean.  Thanks so much for a great stay.  We'll be back!  "
9460,1305968,2012-05-19,2310114,Jose,"Siena is the type of person that makes you love this AirBnB thing. She was delightful and the room was marvelous. There was everything I needed and more. I had to leave later than expected and she was more than happy to help me out by giving me more time to get my things ready and leave.

She even made more space in the room so I could fit my bike in there, so for that I'm really grateful. 

If you are hesitating on staying here you are crazy. Come a enjoy her hospitality, because it is way better than a hotel. Its location is super convenient, so you won't regret it."
9460,1339030,2012-05-24,1656182,Caroline,"My stay at this room was perfect and Siena as a host was amazing! The location of the apartment is a short walk from Westlake light rail station and Convention Center. Lots of fabulous restaurants in the area. The room is easy to access, decorated lovely and very clean and comfortable. I greatly appreciate the extra effort Siena made in helping me with receiving packages and also having access to a food bar with a great selection. The wireless access always worked and I had all the space I needed to do work and relax. I highly recommend this room to anyone staying in Seattle!"
9460,1380637,2012-05-30,447170,Stephanie,I would highly recommend Siena and her B&B!  I called it that because that's how it felt.  It was like being at home with everything you need from medicine to fresh flowers and everything in between.  I was sick during my trip and Siena had Nadia bring over extra bottles of water and things for me to help me get better!  I was so thankful that I was only in bed for one day.  I was able to get better the next day to enjoy Seattle before leaving town...Thank you again for your hospitality Siena and Nadia :)
9460,1398248,2012-06-02,1741125,Kathy,"Stay at Sienna's and you will feel like a local staying in a studio apt where the owner stocked the fridge with breakfast goodies plus wine & beer that you can enjoy up on the rooftop! Walked to Pike's Market, Olympic Sculpture Garden on the north waterfront, and to Ivar's at the ferry end.  Also eateries, groceries, & Fedex right around the corner.
The free street parking pass was a huge cost saver, but we only used our car to get to Discovery Park to hike the wooded and beach trails for hours and have a picnic. Sienna even provides a laundry basket and detergent if you need laundry access at her bldg, good bathroom lighting & all the necessities. Huge tree outside the window! "
9460,1485832,2012-06-15,2420710,Jill,"I highly recommend Siena's B&B.  The location is great, the room is cozy, and Siena and Nadia are wonderful hosts.  They'll go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and fun. :-)"
9460,1510659,2012-06-18,1866904,Katie,"I wish I could give 10 stars for Siena's apartment. Words cannot describe the comfort and hospitality we received during our stay in Seattle. We did not get to meet Siena, but she kept in great contact, checking in with us often and providing little surprises throughout our stay (chocolate)! The stocked kitchen was a lovely addition to the stay and made the room feel more like a bed and breakfast.

The location is perfect, we parked our car on the street and did not use it until we left the city. Coffee, oysters, the public market, and anything else we needed was easily within walking distance. 

I highly recommend Siena's apartment for your stay from Seattle. I encourage you to book her place!"
9460,1564769,2012-06-26,1747090,Noel,"I stayed at Siena's B&B for 8 days in mid-June '12 and would do so again. The room is ideally situated downtown within a few minutes walk of Capitol Hill, is private, and very nicely appointed. The bed is comfortable and a variety of continental breakfast items are made available. Siena was very helpful with restaurant and activity recommendations and was responsive to any questions I had. Highly recommended (but not if I'm in town again :-) )."
9460,1603673,2012-07-01,791645,Michael,"I found everything to be ""as advertised."" It was a pleasant, relaxing space that seemed to allow me to get past the jet lag much faster than I usually can in a hotel. I especially liked the ""side street"" feeling that it gave me, as if it would be difficult for anyone to find me, which was just fine with me! She was also very kind to check on me despite a health emergency with one of her family members. A great way to be right on top of downtown Seattle without the hotel buzz!"
9460,1647086,2012-07-07,1827002,Matt,"My wife and I spent a week's vacation at Siena's place and couldn't be happier with our experience.  First, Siena herself was a wonderful hostess- exceedingly accomodating, proactive and very helpful.  Upon confirmation of our stay, we stayed in regular contact leading up to our visit, and she even supplied us with an extensive list of suggestions of things to do that was very helpful.  She checked in with us a few times throughout the week just to make sure everything was going as expected, which we appreciated.  Next, the accomodations were exactly as advertised: a guest room off the hallway in her condo with a private bath across the hallway.  All very clean and beautifully decorated.  We arrived to find snacks in the small kitchenette off the room as well as drinks in the fridge.  A nice desk in the room with free WiFi so I could get on the internet via my laptop, and a TV with cable and a bunch of DVD's to watch, if the feeling moved us.  The building sits right across the street from the Convention Center and, with the use of the parking credentials supplied by Siena, we found parking easy on a first-come, first-served basis.  The location is well located to downtown and just off Pike Street where you could easily get on fine without a car.
I travel to Seattle four times a year for business and I'm strongly considering staying at Siena's place instead of a hotel, just for the comfort factor that I experienced."
9460,1688160,2012-07-12,1723771,Judy,"
What wonderful home away from home. It was all the unexpected extras that were provided that made it so welcoming and (website hidden), wine, drinks. cheese and crackers, breakfast foods and fresh fruit.  All there, complimentary and so nice. The bed, so comfortable.  The provided information on how to get there and things to do was so helpful. My husband and I enjoyed our stay and would recomment Siena's place to anyone wanting a quaint place to stay in downtown Seattle. Judy and Trevor, New Zealand."
9460,1760169,2012-07-21,2409927,Meredith,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Siena's B&B. Our favorite thing about the B&B was its location. We walked everywhere--Pike Market Place, the waterfront, the Space Needle, etc. Siena/Nadia also left a wonderful variety of breakfast foods/snacks for us to enjoy during our stay."
9460,1810734,2012-07-27,2284671,Richard,"As a busy business traveler, I am used to stay in hotels all over the world. In an attempt to limit the expenses of mu trip to a Seattle trade show, I decided to try a B&B. I chose Siena's because of the rating she got and the location (close to downtown, where the trade show was).

Well, what can I say? A lot, but let's summarize it as a surprisingly positive overall experience! 
Siena is definitely a brilliant host, even bringing over her (superfancy autoshift) bike for me to borrow at no cost. Turns out Seattle has a lot of hills, most of them very steep, so my whole ""I'll do everything on a bike"" idea wasn't so brilliant after all. But who cares, Siena's place is at around a 10 minutes walk from the downtown area, much closer than I had estimated based on Google Maps. This makes it very suitable for a business traveler like me.

Siena thinks of everything. The bathroom holds endless shampoos, soaps and what nots, as well as a hair dryer and an ironing boards. The in-room pantry holds a fridge with lots of very welcome extras, like bottles of water, beer and soda. The bed sleeps just fine, the decoration is tasteful. Didn't use the TV, but it was outfitted with a DVD player and a host of DVD movies. Very big plus for me was a high speed wifi connections that I didn't had to share with anyone else (how different this is in even the most expensive hotels, and they even charge you extra for it!). So working in an Europe-based cloud was very bearable.
Great value for money in other words and a very refreshing experience. I never saw Siena personally, but we had a lot of email contact before I came over and all comms were friendly and felt very welcome.
I never ever leave any comments on any of the hotels I visit, as there are so many, but I really wanted to make an exception for this lovely lady and her cozy apartment."
9460,1889271,2012-08-05,1771736,Tiffany,The location is great and Siena is awesome and (email hidden)e even let me use her cool bike. There are a lot of great coffee houses up the hill and a few great restaurants. I would recommend it for the price definitely.
9460,1966671,2012-08-13,468492,Simone,"The apartment is as central as it will get: I attended a conference at the Sharaton, which is only two blocks away, the block in between is the convention center. Meanwhile my boyfriend visited the sights - he walked everywhere (e.g., the Pike market is 10/15min walking distance). And if you prefer taking the bus, several lines depart right around the corner.

The apartment itself holds every amenity  one could think of (starting which a frigde stocked with things you will love, fresh flowers, shampoo etc., and even Aspirin, in case you need it). Siena would reply promptly to every email; we also had her cell number but didn’t have the need to call her, as she is a planning master mind and had thought of everything in advance. 

Overall , my boyfriend and I enjoyed the stay very much and can only recommend it!
"
9460,2312823,2012-09-17,2029900,Ernest,"What a fun, great place to stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.  The bed was very comfortable, the room was very clean and we really enjoyed all the little extras that were there to make it a great visit.
You can tell that Siena truly cares about her guests and wants it to be a very good experience and she's made sure the bedroom and bathroom are stocked with whatever you might need.  The apartment is walking distance to some great food and of course Pike's Market. and the neighborhood seemed quiet and safe.  Thumbs Up!  "
9460,2369337,2012-09-22,2710840,"Tina,Yuk Ying","We stayed at Siena's house for a week. The tastefully design & mood of the apartment first caught my sight at the airbnb website.  Before our departure,Siena  emails me very often reminding me of our trip and providing us many useful guides for getting around. To my expectation, the room is clean, very lovely with flower specially for the guest. Bathroom has lots of shampoos, soaps , hair dryer, even an iron and an ironing board. Siena prepared  lots of very welcome extras in the fridge, like bottles of water, white wine, beer and soda, fruit,milk, bread & jam. I can say our breakfast is not a light one. Moreover, Siena will send us some surprises  like fresh blueberries, chocolate & pot flower. The bed is very comfortable and  a high speed wifi connections helps my husband a lot. We highly recommend Siena's place and would like to stay again & again."
9460,2486366,2012-10-02,1822069,Sandra,"Sienna was a lovely hostess and very helpful. I left my nightgown there and she is mailing it back to me.  She was very gracious and totally accommodating, I was able to get a late check out, which I was helpful. The room was nicely decorated and she thought of every small thing. The fridge was stocked with enough for a simple breakfast.She also had a welcoming bottle of wine! I loved the location. I like to walk in down town Seattle and it was fun to be in the heart of things so quickly. My only complaint is that the hallways in the building smelled a bit musty, though it was not at all noticeable in the room. The bed was comfortable too, it has a nice memory foam topper. The wifi worked well. the bathroom was clean and she provided soap and shampoo and there was even a new spare toothbrush in case someone forgot theirs. Over all a very delightful experience!"
9460,2531035,2012-10-07,3504333,Thomas,These words cannot glow enough to express the positive experience I had staying in Siena's cozy B&B. She and her assistant Nadia were so very kind and solicitous of both my comfort and privacy. The room amenities were superior to those of any luxury hotel. I very much enjoyed my stay. Highly recommended for any business or vacation traveller. 
9460,2862188,2012-11-12,3576204,Teri,"This was my 1st visit to Seattle & my first time using airbnb.  Based on my experience, I hope it will not be the last for either.  My accomodations &Siena's hospitality were certainly a large part of the reason I hope to return.  I was attending a work-related educational event at the Downtown Sheraton & Siena's place is only 3 blocks away.  It is also right next to the Convention Center & close to most major hotels & shopping downtown.  I did not have a car but was able to get everywhere I wanted to go by walking or public transportation.  Siena's Convention Center B& B is uphill from most of the hotels, shopping & the Light Link Rail station, but the only time I really felt the climb was when I arrived with my luggage, & bus transportation is always available.   I was able to squeeze in some sightseeing & excellent meals (at restaurants Siena recommended), all on foot or using the light rail.  The room was serenely comfortable & quiet; I loved being able to get away from the hyperactivity of my meeting.  And Siena & Nadia really spoiled me with lots of plush towels in the bathroom, a robe and great treats in the refrigerator for breakfast, especially the fresh blackberries (a personal favorite).  Siena & Nadia were available if I needed them for questions and concerns, but otherwise I had my personal space & privacy; I really felt like I was staying in my own suite in a luxury hotel.  If I go back to Seattle in the future (& I certainly hope to), I will try to stay at Siena's again & definitely will recommend her place to anyone I know heading that way."
9460,2913148,2012-11-19,601662,Meredith,"Absolutely magical place to stay! Clean, comfortable, and close to everything. Convention Center was a block and a half away and easy walking distance to food, shopping, entertainment. Great communication from Siena and seamless key pickup and drop-off. Can't recommend highly enough! "
9460,2950643,2012-11-24,3861458,Alison,Awesome location. Very comfortable bed. Excellent communication with Siena. Her attention to detail is to be commended. We would happily book with her again.
9460,2986005,2012-11-28,3671781,Cynthia,"This place worked out great for us. I really loved the little extra perks like fruit and yoghurt, etc. Even wine and beer! The location is very convenient, and it was quiet and comfortable."
9460,3385885,2013-01-21,4612101,Dave,A great place with an unbeatable location for a great price. Not only does Siena provide a clean comfortable place with great amenities (it's like having a free minibar) but her recommendations for places to eat and things to see were outstanding. We got an extra special welcome at a couple of restaurants when we mentioned her name! Will happily stay again on our next trip to Seattle. 
9460,3434673,2013-01-29,83166,Julie,"A terrific place to stay! I was in town for a conference, and the location could not have been better - just a tiny walk in the morning to the convention center and minutes from all kinds of downtown attractions. The room was comfortable and quiet, a wonderful retreat each evening, and felt very private. Siena and her assistant Nadia were extremely helpful and thoughtful, providing a well-stocked breakfast area, fresh flowers and extra toiletries - I even came back one drizzly evening to find a small pot of homemade soup outside my door! Siena provided lots of information for my stay before I arrived and was quick to respond to any questions or requests I had. I would definitely stay here again."
9460,3875959,2013-03-24,4340791,Shaina,"My husband and I visited Seattle for 11 days to attend research meetings at the convention center and a nearby hotel. We can not say enough positive things about our stay! I met Siena once when first arriving and then did not run into her again for the duration of our stay. She left us very clear instructions about how to leave her dirty dishes and towels and about accessing the rooftop decks and some restaurant recommendations, etc. The rooftop decks had a great view! As stated in other reviews, the free minibar of snacks was really fantastic! She even left us additional goodies by the door throughout the stay. This really helped out, especially since we were traveling for such a long period of time and had early mornings/late evenings. The location was ideal for attending my meeting at the convention center and the Fairmont Olympic Hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. If/when I return to Seattle I would absolutely try to book again to stay in Siena's place. "
9460,4056695,2013-04-06,2750828,Martin,Place was super welcoming and had all the little nice touches to make me feel at home;) Highly recommended!
9460,4103587,2013-04-09,118846,Brad,"If your looking to stay downtown Seattle, location does not get much better than this. Walking distance to water, shops, and restaurants. if you bring your vehicle another huge plus is the onstreet  parking permit included. Parking downtown Seattle very expensive, especially overnight..
Room cozy and quiet. Nice older building. A little crowded with 2 people but perfect for 1.Nice small touches including bowl of homemade chicken curry. Excellent communication with host although we never met. Would definately recomend if looking for a view nights in downtown Seattle."
9460,4197191,2013-04-17,5131373,Sofia,"Our stay at Siena's place was wonderful, she is a great host. Just before our stay she gave us clear instruction about getting the room and many other thing. The place is really clean and confortable. The fridge was full of many good things for breakfast. Siena even provide to us a pass in order to park on the street. It is perfectly located in downtown , it is close to everything by walking in order to visit seattle. We had a lot of privacy during our stay.We only met her once, at the end of our stay. She was really nice and welcoming. If we come back to seattle we definitivly stay at Siena's place, it was as confortable as an hotel but we felt like if we were at home. In her instruction Siena also advise some restaurant and places which were really good. Definitely the best place to stay in Seattle!"
9460,4245530,2013-04-22,5090843,Julianna,"We had a fabulous stay in Seattle! The location is perfect, especially if you are attending a conference or other event at the Convention Center-it's really a stone's throw away. Even if you aren't, this is a great downtown location.

The price was amazing and even if I had been able to find a similarly located hotel for the same price (which would never happen), the value here is much greater. Food, including breakfast, snacks, beer, and wine, were all provided for free! You can tell Sienna really makes an effort to provide all the little details- flowers in the room, extra umbrellas, a guidebook, etc.

Finally, if you do stay here make sure to follow Sienna's wonderful restaurant recommendations. We ate amazing food everywhere we went :)"
9460,4317199,2013-04-27,5971283,Phillip,"I had a great time in Seattle, and a lot of that was thanks to Sienna and her accommodations. It's a great location and she really went above and beyond to make my stay pleasurable. I only met her once, but it was obvious that she takes great pride in providing a quality experience to her clients.

Everything was spotlessly clean and well cared for.

I can't recommend this place to stay enough really. Whenever I am back in town, I won't be shopping around. 

Thank you Sienna!"
9460,4364399,2013-04-30,5744544,Beverly,"Wonderful, cozy, comfortable, private.  Siena was very accommodating to our needs and provided numerous complementaries. We would return."
9460,4528675,2013-05-11,5063599,Zsolt,I had a fantastic stay in Seattle thanks to in large part by the room rented from Sienna through Airbnb. I can just encourage everybody to use the website to find lodging whenever needed. 
9460,4602382,2013-05-14,519778,György,"The stay in this aparment was wonderful, perfect location (just in downtown, Westlake station is 5 minutes walk, car rental is 3 minutes walk), nice room and Siena was a very kind host. 
I definitely recommend this place to stay."
9460,4804204,2013-05-27,5416078,Janet,"What a wonderful experience staying with Siena! The room is darling, the breakfast stuff was great, and it's all about location, location, location! We walked everywhere, had quiet restful nights, and didn't want for a thing our entire visit. I highly recommend this very sweet accommodation! Thanks Siena and Nadia! "
9460,4922918,2013-06-02,6174708,Youlim,"I have to tell you about Siena who would go beyond and above to make you feel comfortable staying at her condo. My flight got canceled, and  I arrived there around 11 pm. She texted me to see if I was ok and left me a nice warm meal with white wine so that I didn't have to go out after the long flight. God bless her! I'd love to come back and stay there. "
9460,4994508,2013-06-06,5910220,Michael,"Exactly as described.  Host is not actually there so no face-to-face contact.  But she was very generous with brochures, maps, DVDs for TV, and food for breakfast and snacks.

Very convenient to Convention Center!

One minor problem: it was unusually hot that week so window had to be left open, no A/C available or really needed.  But since the apartment is near an highway, this made it a little noisy at night.  But how often is it hot in Seattle?"
9460,5104201,2013-06-12,840442,Laura,"We are just back from a wonderful stay in Seattle at Siena's condo.  Siena provided detailed information and directions that we followed and had no problem getting to the condo from the airport.  In fact, we took the light rail and the whole trip from the airport cost us only $4!  I highly recommend getting there this way if you don't have a car.  The condo is in a perfect location and we found we could get to so many sites on foot and monorail.  One does not need a car at all.  We followed Siena's recommendations for a few restaurants nearby and had several great meals.  
The room itself was clean, nicely decorated, and stocked with absolutely everything one could need and more.  Fresh flowers welcomed us as well as wine, sparkling water and a stocked fridge.  The accommodations were very private.  We only ran into Siena once and she is a lovely person.  Very eager to make your stay a good one. She was very accommodating and worked with our arrival and departure times which allowed us to make the most of our time.   Personally, I prefer to experience a city this way rather than stay in a hotel.  I highly recommend Siena's condo for your stay in Seattle and I would definitely stay with her again when I come back to Seattle."
9460,5156073,2013-06-16,30088,Cheri + Andrew,"Siena was an excellent host.  She gave wonderful directions and left lots of great pearls about the neighborhood and things to do and see.  She was very attentive to expected needs and there were a lot of yummy treats for breakfast.  I was attending a conference at the convention center next door, and it was a very convenient location.  I would happily recommend staying here.  "
9460,5271272,2013-06-22,4773964,Bojana,"I absolutely enjoyed the stay in the lovely room! It had a perfect location for attending a conference in the Convention Center and for walks to Downtown and Capitol Hill, with a total privacy paired with warm and kind hosting including wonderful food and drinks. Many thanks to Siena and Nadia!"
9460,5635076,2013-07-09,524865,Brian,"First, let me say I highly recommend using Siena's place! I finally met someone as detail oriented as I am. When we arrived at her place, she answered my call immediately. Checking in was easy and problem free. When we arrived, there was a letter that pretty much answered any question we had. It was detailed so well, I looked back on it during the stay. As many have mentioned, when we arrived there were items in the refrigerator and some food on the shelf area above the fridge. Plates, spoons, forks, knifes, and glasses, etc were there. The bathroom was also well stocked with the items needed throughout the day. Need an iron or blow dryer? It was there...need to sew on a button? There was a kit if needed. Soap, shampoo, etc were also there. We even washed some laundry during our stay. Fresh fruit and other goodies were left in front of the door a few times. And the place was clean!! We never met Siena face to face, and I always felt we had total privacy. She sent me a text a few times, just to see how we were doing, a nice touch. I have used hotel alternatives in Seattle, Portland, Santa Barbara, L.A., Chicago, and Toronto on multiple occasions, and this was the best and most prepared place for the traveler by far. She has thought of all the little things you forgot or wish you had. Chance are they are there. Her experience with airbnb shows. I told my wife that we will be hard pressed to ever find another rental so well prepared. And don't let me forget to mention the condo is in a great central location. Especially important if you like walking places like we do. There is really no need for a car. We also used the rail system when we arrived and departed. $2.75 one way to and from the airport. The stop is about a 12 minute walk from her place. A great money saver. In closing, when your out of town, finding a place that is well prepared for the traveler should be your number one priority. This place is it! Secure this unit with confidence. "
9460,5712489,2013-07-13,6281115,Andrew,"Siena's place was the perfect place for my Seattle stay, especially because I didn't have a car. Located just on the border between downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill, it was extremely easy to get to both neighborhoods on foot. It was also very close to the downtown bus/Link tunnel so it was easy to explore neighborhoods farther afoot. The place itself was lovely and had lots of amenities -- free water, snacks, fruit, coffee, beer (!), writing utensils, letter-opener, TV/DVDs to watch, etc -- that really made you feel like you were staying in an actual hotel/B&B instead of someone's random room, but for a price that you'd never be able to match at an actual hotel/B&B in the area. I would highly recommend staying here and hope to do so again if I am ever in Seattle again."
9460,5823051,2013-07-18,5676464,Gigi,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and it exceeded my expectations! The room was clean and cozy, private, and tastefully decorated.  Not only were all the toiletries provided but the mini-fridge was fully stocked with snacks, fresh fruit, breakfast items, and even adult beverages.  The condo is located in a very convenient neighborhood just a short jaunt to the conference center, and exceptionally priced.  It met my needs perfectly. I can’t wait to visit Siena in Seattle again!  Thanks for a great visit."
9460,6274495,2013-08-06,6642163,Michael,"A home away from home. I won't repeat all the positives listed on other reviews (as there are so many) but to emphasise the experience was excellent and Siena could not have been more hospitable and informative, from a couple of weeks before, throughout and afterwards. We were made to feel very welcome and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this well kitted out apartment in what we considered to be the best location. Would love to return to Seattle and when we do we will stay here again."
9460,6457134,2013-08-13,6533076,Dan,"If you want a comfortable, convenient, reasonably priced stay in Seattle, you want to stay here. It has my highest recommendation. The condo building is really close to the Convention Center, and therefore everything else; 15 minute walk to the lightrail. In fact, it is a really quick and easy walk to all downtown has to offer (A MUST: Biscuit Bi*ch on 1st Street). It is also extremely near a number of good bus lines to take you other places. Sienna is an amazingly attentive host who stocked the kitchenette with yummy treats (fresh cherries!) and a lot of other little surprising comforts. But let's talk about the bed: I was traveling with my 35-weeks pregnant wife for a wedding, so comfort was a priority. When we got home on Monday, she asked, ""How do we make our bed as comfortable as the one at the AirBnB?"" No joke. Stay here. "
9460,6705372,2013-08-22,869401,Paul,"Great location, heat place, great host!!!  You'll love it here. "
9460,6847970,2013-08-27,3282499,Tricia,"Siena and her housekeeper, Nadia, have created an absolutely relaxing and beautiful space to come home to in Seattle. I was welcomed with flowers, fresh fruit, sparkling water, and a refrigerator filled with even more goodies! (Siena was kind enough to even ask my milk preferences!) They haven't missed a single detail in order to make the stay comfortable, accommodating, informative, and helpful; From the ""to-do"" recommendations and informative instruction labels around the apartment, to the DVD & CD collection in the entertainment center and the ""sometimes forgotten"" toiletries in the private bathroom.  And I have to comment on how comfortable the bed is! Absolutely perfect!  This is a wonderful place to stay and enjoy the best that Seattle has to offer, which is so very close by!  I had a fantastic time in Seattle during the week I was working there, and Siena's accommodations were very much apart of that positive experience!  "
9460,7005985,2013-09-03,3059776,Michael,"Siena was a fantastic host! I was working at the nearby convention center for a week, and when returning to my room in the evening I'd often find a small basket of goodies outside my door. It was always a welcome surprise after a long and exhausting day. The room itself was very comfortable, nicely furnished, and included a well-stocked kitchenette. It's rare that I feel truly at ease while traveling, but the accommodations here made me feel right at home."
9460,7160174,2013-09-09,5913676,Jamie,"Siena was a lovely host! This place was incredible--close to everything Seattle has to offer, very comfortable and provided all the amenities we needed for our stay. Would stay here again if I ever make it back up to Seattle! Highly recommended!"
9460,7306594,2013-09-15,7993059,Luie,"An absolutely wonderful experience. Siena is a great host, very accomodating and she did everything to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable. I have advised my friends and colleagues to stay at her place when they visit Downtown Seattle. The 100+ positive reviews about Siena and her place are all true. I hope all hosts will be like Siena."
9460,7432254,2013-09-20,6710384,Glenda,"Siena's room was fine for a short stay in Seattle. 
The bedroom is about the same size as a small hotel room - it has plenty of storage, then there is a kitchenette/food prep area off the bedroom and the bathroom is off the hallway - great shower and a generous amount of toiletries provided. The breakfast items left in the fridge also reflects a generous nature, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, milk, hard boiled eggs, muffins. 
We didn't need to buy any breakfast foods while we were in Seattle.
There is a convenience store just around the corner and a bustop nearby should you need it. 
The apartment building though is well located, a short walk to the main shopping precinct around 5th and 6th Streets and about an 11 block walk to Pike Place Market.
There is plenty to do and see, and I would highly recommend visiting Chihuly Glass Gardens, by the Space Needle.
A ferry trip to Bainbridge Island is also a pleasant experience.
"
9460,7672168,2013-09-29,5239102,Trevor,"Thinking about booking a hotel in Seattle? Fogetta'bout it!  Siena's place is literally an experience like none other. I stayed in her luxury accommodations while visiting for a conference and could not have felt more at home from the moment I walked in the front door.  From the fresh blueberries and sparking water greeting me to the toiletries and fully stocked fridge, it was better than staying at a five star hotel.  Not to mention the TV and plethora of movies available.  On top of everything, Siena is about the nicest host (and person) you will ever meet.

Simply said, stay here.  All of my friends staying at the Hilton and Sheraton were beyond jealous."
9460,7773056,2013-10-02,4383453,Armen,"Siena was a great host. Great experience, property is a few blocks from everything :) "
9460,7848880,2013-10-06,3707558,Charles,"If you're looking for a great Airbnb experience, here is the place to start!  Airbnb should use Siena to train other hosts.  She'll give you ALL the information you need about her place and has just the ""right balance"" between being friendly and helpful without being pushy or hovering over your every move.  Our experience was exactly as others have described.  I have to just reiterate the attention to detail.  Plenty of towels (no reusing if you don't want to), plenty of snacks & goodies, plenty of TWO PLY toilet paper, batteries, rubber bands, staplers, just about everything you can think of - Siena has already thought of it first ;)  A couple of notes about the location, if you're going to a convention, grab this place - it is SOOO close to the convention center, a very easy walk.  And it is also within walking distance to all the major downtown attractions of Seattle for those on vacation.  If you're in a car, I'd recommend looking up the ""Zone 21"" parking areas (where you can use the free pass Siena provides) around the condos and then parking your car and leave it there (up to 72 hours) as you walk to your destinations.  It is in the city (good for walking :-), but if you're not used to city noises at night, Siena also provides a ""white noise"" machine for your use.  The condominium itself is quieter than most hotels I've stayed at in big cities.  Again, if you're on the fence about Airbnb, this is a GREAT spot to get started, Siena does a wonderful job of making sure you have a comfortable and pleasant stay at her place."
9460,7979197,2013-10-11,7839974,Misoo,"Everything was much better than expected. The room was well equipped and organised with some extra nice touches - flowers, coffee, cookies.. Besides, Siena was more than a host to me. During my stay at hers, she was my guide, assistant, friend and big sister. I won't be able to forget the time, meals and conversations we had togeter. Without you, I am sure that my stay in Seattle must have been much less enjoyable. "
9460,8044701,2013-10-14,1245634,LeAnn,"I had been trying to book Siena's room for a few trips over the last two years and it has always been booked. I was so happy to get in this try and it did not disappoint. It was exactly what I needed and more! The location was perfect in every way. You could walk to anything downtown and easily catch a bus if going further. It felt safe for my daughter and I who was 19. Being able to park free in the city was a huge bonus, and the room itself was perfect! Siena contacted me ahead of time to find out if I had any special requests for breakfast and snacks. I told her our few requests and she went above and beyond in making sure that I had exactly what I needed. Most places give a reasonable breakfast but Sienna had great choices with snacks as well. I was so impressed! She also had fresh flowers in three places, anything you would need as far as toiletries, and great bedding. Siena was so helpful to us as far as information about the area, and at the same time respectful of our privacy. I can't say enough about our great experience! I cannot wait to come back to Seattle and will hopefully stay at Siena's every time! "
9460,8257753,2013-10-22,8928083,Scott,"Like the others who reviewed before me, this was a great find for me.  It was a great location, and the combination of bigger things (e.g. clean space, WiFi, reasonable price, etc.) and smaller details (e.g. bathroom toiletries, mid-stay check-in message, etc.) demonstrate that a lot of thought went into making this appealing to travelers.  "
9460,8363850,2013-10-28,613972,Attefa,"Siena was very pleasant and went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was enjoyable. Location was close to many restaurants, movies, and tourist hot spots. Room had ample space, wifi, tv with many dvd movie options, and cozy breakfast area. She made sure our breakfast area was fully stocked and that we were comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay at Siena's and would recommend it to others."
9460,8564442,2013-11-05,8441390,Crystal,"This place is awesome! Only a short 10 block walk from pike place market to the left and 5 short blocks from dicks burgers in Capitol Hill. It's a 1 mile hike to the space needle which to those who are not from a city like myself may seem like a lot but I promise you there is so much to look at that you won't even notice. I had my own private bathroom and bedroom a parking pass (which saves a lot of $$) and fresh food,coffee & teas!! At no extra charge! There's an aray of DVDs for you to choose from and Siena is sooooo super nice and helpful! She checked in on my perodicly through my stay making sure I didn't need anything or want anything. And the bed is soooo comfortable! Some days I didn't want to get up! I would definitely stay here and recommend to friends! "
9460,8691190,2013-11-12,9215201,Jim,"We had a great stay at Siena's AirBnB.  The room , bathroom and little kitchen nook were ideal for our 5 night stay.  My wife and I have owned and run an inn in Vermont for almost 30 years now.  If Siena ever moves east and is looking for a job, we would hire her in a minute.  She is an expert at hospitality!  My wife is gluten intolerant so Siena stocked the kitchen nook with gluten free items, including making some gluten free muffin tops.  Above and beyond!
The location was also very convenient, especially for anyone wanting to be in the Capital Hill area of Seattle.
Thank you Siena for providing such a wonderful place for us to base our visit out of."
9460,8774873,2013-11-17,6060561,Sarah,"Everything was as Siena and other reviewers said it would be.  The location is as close to the convention center as most of the hotels.  It was cosy and clean.  Very quiet and safe.  Easy walk from the rail station.  Siena made sure all was ready.  Thoughtful array of items in mini bar and for breakfast.  Thorough info. on restaurants, attractions and about Seattle.  Very happy with this choice.  I will stay here the next time I am in town.  "
9460,8834403,2013-11-20,9473874,David,"Siena is the best host one could help for! Her place is warm and welcoming. It's location is perfect to get around anywhere you would like to, walking distance to pikes place and other great locations and neighborhoods. She makes it her goal for you to have a great stay."
9460,8898177,2013-11-25,8995226,Emily,"Great room in downtown Seattle.  Was in town for a conference and the Convention Center is right around the corner.  Comfy bed, quiet private room, small treats, 10 minute walk to everything.  Siena is a great host.  Would stay here again if I make it back to Seattle."
9460,9095499,2013-12-06,1568400,Stephanie,"Siena and her cute downtown apartment were amazing. She went out of her way to make sure our trip was exceptional - from holding the perfect parking spot for us, to giving me extra winter clothes because I said I didn't pack enough and was cold! The breakfast, fruit and water in the mini fridge made things so much easier for us when we wanted to get out of the house quickly. And the parking pass for the city was icing on the cake. 

I would recommend her place to any 1 or 2 people coming into the city - tight quarters, but comfortable. Easy walk to great shopping, Pikes Place market, Capitol Hill.

Thanks Siena!"
9460,9216022,2013-12-14,10196846,Samuel,Siena is very accommodating and sweet.  Very attentive and considerate. 
9460,9367383,2013-12-24,5371330,Carol,"I stayed at Siena's place while I was in Seattle for a convention. The location was great, just two blocks away. The bed was extremely comfortable.  There was always plenty of food for breakfast. The apartment was beautiful, and Siena was so helpful. You will not find a place as cozy and as comfortable as this for the price and for the location. If I'm ever I Seattle again I will definitely stay here again and I recommend this place to anyone going to Seattle."
9460,9427093,2013-12-28,7713065,Zimin,"The apartment was well furnished, and well-stocked with food, laundry needs, and amenities. It may be a tight space but it's got everything you need for a comfortable stay! Siena is also an incredibly detailed and accommodating host. She was very kind all the while and we felt very welcomed even before we got there from the way she communicated with us. We also made a mistake with checkout times and that was completely our fault but Siena was still more than civil about it, which I am so grateful for. Thanks for everything, Siena!"
9460,9539630,2014-01-02,9266194,Kuan-Chuan,"As the previous reviews, the room is nice and warm with plenty of free food. Even I didn't meet Siena in person during my stay, she still gave me lots of useful information about where to go or things to do, which enriches my entire trip. This is my first time booking a room with Airbnb, and I'm glad that I choose this room. I'll definitely book this room if I visit Seattle again."
9460,9744339,2014-01-07,10354677,Chuyuan,"Siena's place definitely made my three-day-trip to Seattle a cozy and wonderful memory. Everything was super sweet in the apartment; and the location was just brilliant. Most importantly, I felt that Siena really cares about everyone who stays in her place! I would definitely recommand this bnb to all of my friends travelling to the city."
9460,9874663,2014-01-16,3007321,Glenis,"I enjoyed a superb one week stay at Siena’s place in downtown Seattle.  The room was clean, warm, quiet and welcoming and included fresh flowers with lots of space and light for me to sit and relax and I had my own bathroom, two steps away – nice.  I was provided with enough breakfast food (fresh blueberries, bananas, yogurt, muffins, teas, etc.) and snacks (beer, wine popcorn, etc.) during my stay, which was greatly appreciated.  The internet worked beautifully and I relaxed on the roof deck that has great views of the city. I was able to navigate around the city on my own without a car, the Westlake transportation hub and Monorail are within walking distance.  I felt safe walking around the neighborhood at various times of the day and evening.  Communication with Siena was clear and informative, from the time I made my reservation to my departure.
I had the pleasure of meeting the very hospitable and attentive Siena and Nadia, which was a delight.  Thank you ladies for a fabulous stay, I look forward to seeing you again. I highly recommend Siena’s downtown place if planning to visit Seattle.

9460,9948837,2014-01-21,8181557,Allie,"I honestly cannot express in words how fantastic Siena made my Seattle experience. She was very sweet & accommodating & truly such a pleasure to deal with. The condo is absolute perfection. The location is marvelous (I didn't rent a car & spent less than $20 on transportation for my whole trip because everything is short walk away)! It's perfectly tucked away from the hustle of city life so it's very quiet but still right in the heart of the action.

I HIGHLY recommend staying with Siena. You'll feel right at home in this beautiful city!"
9460,10015462,2014-01-25,9278877,Tamzin,"Siena's place was great, very central, I could walk to pike place market the space needle, there was great shopping and food options all nearby. It was very private and I found it very comfortable, complete with thoughtful touches like flowers, toiletries, coffee making facilities. I would definitely stay here again!"
9460,10145047,2014-02-03,157614,Florian,"I had a very pleasant stay. Everything was fine – good place (directly at Pike & Pine – just some walking minutes for food, music venues, art shops – or the other direction to the seafront and famous Pike Place Market), nice apartment at the 7th floor with windows, nice facilities – microwave, fridge, hot shower, tv, dvd, perfect Wifi and so on. A grocery is around the corner.  

If you have dirty dishes or towels you can give it to the housekeeper Nadia (I have never seen her), she puts it (cleaned) back in front of your room. Mostly with some nice gifts like food, drinks and newspaper. 

I never used it, but there is a washing machine in the complex.

Location is near to a main bus station and the famous monorail is not far away.  

Good communication with Siena. If you need her, she will be there. And you feel very welcome!

More than a good stay! Everytime again."
9460,10202959,2014-02-06,1942551,Eph,"Wow! What an awesome find. The room was literally a 2-minute walk to WSCC, where I'm attending a conference. The location was perfect and walked throughout the city (incl. the experience of the Seahawks championship parade), The room was impeccably clean and the continental breakfast (with Starbucks coffee and a French press) was a huge help to get my day. Ms. Ross was incredibly helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended and I would love to stay here again if visiting Seattle."
9460,10248307,2014-02-09,664373,Katy,"Although I only got to spend a short time in Seattle for a conference, my stay could not have been more pleasant! Siena provided loads of great information and the room was super comfy. The added ""complimentary mini-bar"" was the icing on the cake. She was also super flexible when weather messed with my arrival time. I hope to be able to come back soon!!"
9460,10527985,2014-02-24,10138362,Jodi,"One of the best places I've ever stayed! Not only was the room comfortable and in a good location, Siena provided everything you could possibly think of...from toiletries to umbrellas, and even food and drinks! I even came back to the room on a couple occasions to little food and drink care packages left outside the door! I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"

9460,10812800,2014-03-09,10766235,Michael,Siena is the ultimate hostess.  My room was clean and supplied with all the little touches one could ever need.  The condo is within walking distance to great restaurants and downtown.  Siena switched parking spaces with me and I was able to park right in front of the building.  I never needed my car at all during my stay because the location is so convenient to everything in the city.  I would recommend this condo and plan to return in the future!
9460,10904271,2014-03-12,6413941,Catherine,"A friend and I traveled to Seattle for a few days and we so enjoyed our stay at Siena's!  Although we never met in person, Siena went out of her way to accommodate us by allowing us to check-in with our luggage early and then letting us check-in earlier than scheduled.  There was fresh fruit waiting for us on arrival - as well as a well-stocked kitchen with wine, water, breakfast items, and other snacks.  The location is an easy walk to downtown and there are plenty of bus stops along the way.  Should we find ourselves in Seattle, we would definitely stay here again! "
9460,11003809,2014-03-17,11152677,Myrna,"I stayed here during my birthday weekend in March. The room was perfect and so conveniently located near everything downtown. The rooftop view was gorgeous and the 6arms bar about two blocks up on Pike st became our go to spot just about each night. Laidback environment and great happy hour specials till closing, the wine sampler special was my favorite. All of the details provided by Siena really added to our comfort experience throughout the whole trip. We were provided with the luxuries of home away from home with all the perks of a private get away. You wont be able to get this in your average hotel stay and I would definitely, and already have, recommend this location for a great stay in Seattle."
9460,11145849,2014-03-23,7092141,Shannon,"I am actually so very happy that I did not have the budget to stay in a hotel for a conference I recently attended at the Sheraton in downtown Seattle, because it led me to to Siena and her amazing place. Staying with her is one of the best travel experiences I have had - and though I say ""staying with her,"" I never would have had to see her if I didn't seek her out; I made a point of meeting her because I wanted to thank her personally for the amazing experience I was having. Though it is totally private, the place feels like you are being ""hosted"" by a dear friend, like a little bed-and-breakfast oasis. I felt provided for (there was wine and beer waiting for me, and breakfast foods!) and taken care of in a way that was so delightfully unexpected. I also cannot overstate how close this place is to the convention center and the other conference venues in the area, as well as numerous tourist attractions.  Why anyone would stay in the overpriced hotels a couple of blocks away is beyond me. 

In short: Siena is an angel and an amazing though invisible hostess, and this is one of the best values you are going to find anywhere. "
9460,11278703,2014-03-28,10808235,Francesca,"Siena was an extremely kind and great host! Being that it was my first time in Seattle, she was very accommodating. Siena and I were in communication the entire time and check in with me continually to make sure I was having a great stay. She was really really sweet. I also greatly appreciated her providing complementary snacks. Most properties typically don't do that so the fact she did was incredibly sweet of her. The unit is very quaint and cute for a a solo traveler like myself or a couple. The property is also conveniently located from Downtown Seattle. It is about 6 blocks from Pike Place Market. All in all it was a great unit and Siena is a great host! I would most definitely stay with her again when I go back to Seattle! =) "
9460,11342386,2014-03-31,10101182,Nickolette,"Fantastic place, extremely comfortable and welcoming. It was better than I expected and very well equipped! I will definitely recommend it to anyone needing accommodations in downtown Seattle."
9460,11483608,2014-04-05,5576013,Philippe,"We are just back from a week at Seattle. We stayed at Siena Ross Downtown Convention Center (website hidden) one word, it was a great choice on all aspects. The location : perfect; so convenient as right into downtown : 10 minutes to Pike Place Market! No need to take the car to visit the whole city. In addition, Siena helped by organizing the parking by switching her own car so that we could park ours; furthermore, we benefited from her parking pass / resident permit. Very very nice indeed.The room : very nicely decorated, with style, and very well equiped. The explaination that Siena had sent us prior to arrival were extremely comprehensive and helpfull : there was everything to help you prepare your visit of Seattle and suroundings. In short : if you need a place to stay at Seattle : no need to search further; you must contact Siena and stay there. Very best regards."
9460,11949441,2014-04-20,3187548,Nicola,This is a great apartment right in Downtown Seattle. Siena was a great host--very responsive--but I didn't need her for much since the apartment was so well equipped! Thanks for a great stay:)
9460,12140108,2014-04-23,668531,Andrea,"This has been my best airbnb experience yet. Siena's thoughtfulness in providing everything we needed and more just blew me away. The kitchenette was well stocked with snacks and beverages, and the first night we received a basket of muffins and yogurt and fresh berries for our breakfasts. It was an unexpected but delightful surprise. The bed is so comfortable, and the room is warm and cozy. 
Also, the central location made it really easy to get where we needed to go. The bus interchange is two blocks away, and so many great places (museums, library, cafes) are within walking distance."
9460,12329407,2014-04-29,11735206,Victor,"Siena was an awesome host, kind, considerate and always thoughtful.  This was a great, convenient and secure place to stay and I have already reserved with Siena again for next year.   From the moment she remotely buzzed me in (I called her at 1 am due to my very late flight arrival), her good cheer, gracious care and attention to detail were readily apparent, even unmatched, in my many travels.  The room is nicely sized with plenty of storage (large closet and two small dressers), two nice large openable windows, with dark shades for sleeping, and had all the comforts of a nicely and artfully appointed home, a very comfortable bed and fluffy very fine comforter.  The microwave/fridge/pantry had everything I needed, including a so thoughtfully stocked fridge and pantry (I am sure I am forgetting lots but including fresh raspberries, Greek Yogurt, English muffins, bananas, apples, nice jam, nice butter, milk, juice, 3 different beers, a bottle of very nice wine, bottled water, a bar of exceptional chocolate, jar of honey, her 7 pages of restaurant and other local recommendations (nearly all within short walking distance)--you get the idea- now I know how movie stars live).   Oh, forgot to mention the assorted fine coffees and teas (did I mention I'm a coffee snob and was in town for the world's largest coffee convention?), fresh flowers, coffee brewers of several sorts (Melitta drip cone with filters provided, and French Press), nice cordless electric kettle, small video library, flat screen TV, robes,  umbrellas, emergency rain coat, free on street parking pass (I didn't have a car but wow!), laundry basket with laundry soap and a pile of available quarters for the nice shared coin-op laundry in the building (worked great, I jogged every day to the Elliot Bay Path down Pike St. and so did laundry 3 times, it's only 9 blocks to the waterfront and only 4 blocks to Westlake Station subway station, which takes you all the way to or from the airport for $2.75).  My private bath was clean, nice, warm and nicely appointed, stocked with everything you could want and ample luxuriant, thick towels.  I attended a Convention, and could not believe short 10 to 20 step walk via the very pleasant Freeway Park sidewalk entrance to the Seattle Convention Center, it was essentially a private garden entrance directly to the main floor.   Several times during my stay, Siena emailed/texted to make sure all was well.     Awesome host, awesome stay!  Thank you Siena, see you next year!"
9460,12435369,2014-05-02,4920797,A.J.,"My stay at Siena's can be summed up by saying it was simply outstanding!  Her friendliness and hospitality took me back to my days I'd spent in Europe.  She is absolutely genuine and comforting; she made my stay feel like I was visiting a good family friend or relative.  The special touches were impeccable.  From her assortment of lovely fruits and berries to the fantastic chocolates resting on the cutest shabby-chic desk next to a bottle of French wine.  She greeted me in person the first evening and we immediately connected.  We shared an amazingly delicious meal in the Melrose Market section just a few minutes walk from the condo.  Afterward, Siena thoroughly oriented me to the place and answered all of my questions.  She had a list of helpful instructions, which I referred to on the occasion that she hadn't already answered it for me during dinner.  The bed was extremely comfortable and warm and it was a neat touch to have a spa waffle-weave bathrobe hanging in the closet just ready for me to relax.  The bathroom was the perfect size and had all the necessary (and many extra) toiletries which were complimentary for my use.  The first morning Siena met me before work and she walked with me in the park to show me how to get to work from her place.  What a treat that was!  It made me feel safe and well-cared for.  Since I'm a very busy gal with working in the city and commuting many hours per week up to Whidbey Island to be with my family, it was a place that I would easily call a ""home-away-from-home.""  There is nothing but positive comments as a take-away from my 3-night stay at Siena's.  The breakfast part of the ""b&b"" aspect really made my stay enjoyable.  Siena had a fridge full of yummy and healthy foods from crumpets to greek yogurt to hard-boiled eggs.  Making my coffee with the French press was nice before work each morning too.  Honestly, Siena made me feel so pampered that I immediately looked for open dates to stay again for my work schedule in the city for the rest of the summer, but so many other lucky people have beat me to it!  I'm sure my review will also make my future stays more difficult to book, but it's worth it.  Stay with Siena and you will not regret it for a second."
9460,12608312,2014-05-06,12152291,Susanne,"It was a great stay in Seattle and our start for a road trip down to San Francisco. Even though we didn't have the chance to meet her, Siena took very good care of us and even provided plenty of food and drinks. In addition the communication prior to and during our stay was excellent. As we had a rental car the parking licence was very helpful. The appartment is ideally located just a 5 min walk away from downtown and 10-15 min away from Pike Market. If you arrive by airplane it will only take you half an hour by train and 2.75 USD to get to the appartement."
9460,13204976,2014-05-22,1389364,Michelle,"The day I flew in was a day of epic failures. From being late to the airport to leaving my brand new cell phone in a taxi...and then I finally got to Sienna's. The room was inviting and there were fresh blueberries waiting for me. The day had been so crazy that I had forgotten to eat. Those blueberries were heavenly. I felt right at home. There were snacks and such in the refrigerator, which meant I didn't have to run back out to find food. I also found loads of information on Seattle. Sienna also provided me with flawless information regarding check in, which made my harried day less so. I can't recommend Sienna's place enough. I can only say you will not be disappointed. The location was perfect and so was the (website hidden)...the concierge at the lobby desk helped me retrieve my lost phone by letting me use his cell to call my own. Many thanks to this kind man. "
9460,13338686,2014-05-26,11392384,Bridget,"The accommodations were great. Everything was clean and orderly. Additionally, and of great importance to me because I'm a graduate student, the extras that Siena provided really helped me to afford Seattle on a graduate student budget. "
9460,13730026,2014-06-03,7177483,Dani,"I could not recommend staying with Siena more highly! Such a thoughtful host. The location of the apartment is fantastic. The room is cozy, clean and has everything you could need for a short stay. Every little detail was thought of - even leaving a bag of quarters for the laundry machines! Thanks again Siena. "
9460,13840214,2014-06-06,9189647,Michael,"Cozy room with everything we needed (including delicious food and drink in the fridge -- which got restocked too!), really easy to walk to where we needed to be, including shops, restaurants, the monorail, and a bus stop around the corner. A good laundry room downstairs. Siena thought of everything and made our stay very comfortable. She even met us to take care of our luggage when we arrived earlier than check-in time. Highly recommended!"
9460,14072467,2014-06-11,9688690,Stephen & Susan,"Great place, great location and fabulous host. Sienna provided loads of lovely things for breakfast and lots of extras, really very generous host. We would highly recommend this accommodation."
9460,14261475,2014-06-16,152774,Lesley N Gordon,"A Room with all your needs catered for.  Siena has thought of absolutely everything you could possibly require.  This tastefully decorated room is in a secure building with a lift.  It is a very short walk to the Convention Centre and is centrally located to many attractions, restaurants, bars and cafés.  This spotlessly clean unit is a credit to Siena, who is committed to her guests requirements."
9460,15439996,2014-07-09,9102819,Helene,Siena provided us with more than we expected. She was generous and hospitable. The location was convenient to downtown. 
9460,15901967,2014-07-18,12383304,Jason,"This was a very convenient stay during a conference at the Convention Center. Siena was a friendly host who made sure that everything was satisfactory.

Pros:
-Close to the convention center
-Well stocked with snacks/beverages
-No issues at all - very convenient
-Quite a bit cheaper than a lot of the area hotels

Cons:
-This is one half of the condo, and it's a bit small, so probably not the best if you plan on spending a lot of time there (but fine for a place to sleep)
-No AC (not a big deal normally, but it was pretty warm when I was there)

Overall, I was happy with my stay."
9460,16061079,2014-07-21,14334177,Erin,"Siena was welcoming and accommodating to our needs with check-in time and luggage. It was clear she was sincere in hoping to make our stay pleasant. The room was perfect for our needs, equipped with all one needs for a comfortable visit. The breakfast nook was a plus (stocked with treats!) and the overall location of the unit was excellent- we walked everywhere! Siena is a great host and has thought of everything- really!"
9460,16298047,2014-07-25,4683814,Martin,"We had an excellent experience with our host, Siena. She was available by phone whenever we needed to speak to her and we met her in person to get access to the apartment. She was very hospitable; we were greeted with beer and wine to refresh us on arrival (with a generous top-up half way through our four night stay) and also were provided by Siena with more than generous breakfast supplies.

The listing was described accurately and we found it very comfortable.

The neighbourhood was absolutely fine; very close to downtown and the major attractions. "
9460,16817144,2014-08-03,8084142,Janette,Our host was great. She was very pleasant! She brought us fresh fruit and flowers. The room was Very clean with all the comforts of home. The location was wonderful very easy access to pikes market pioneer square and the space needle. This host went the extra mile to help us enjoy our stay!
9460,17259529,2014-08-10,12006913,Andrea,"This place was so lovely.  It was very comfortable, the refrigerator was stocked with wonderful things, and there was even a blow dryer with a diffuser in the bathroom.  The location was great-- I loved walking around the area.  I would definitely stay here again!"
9460,17816052,2014-08-18,9286319,Stephen,"We had a great time visiting Seattle, the accommodations are in a great location, first vacation without a rental car for us and it wasn't needed at all.  Easy walk, taxi, bus ride where ever we wanted to go.  Room was clean, as described, safe, comfortable.  Thank for sharing your home!!"
9460,18165464,2014-08-23,4921029,Mary,"We loved this location as we were able to walk everywhere. Room was perfect and full of everything you could ever need. Best thing is Sienna sends you a very informative email on how to get to, get in and how to get to what you may want to do while in Seattle. It is a small room but who stays in it. If you are okay with that I would say it's the best place to stay in downtown."
9460,18466541,2014-08-27,2237985,Justin,"Our stay at Siena's place was great. The space was very cozy and homey, perfect for just the two of us. She provided everything we needed –towels, bottles of water in the fridge, and even black-out shades for the windows! We slept like babies. Speaking of, the bed was amazingly comfortable, which was good because we needed the rest —the apartment was only about a 15 or 30 min walk from the most things in downtown including the Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc. so we definitely did our fair share of walking. Siena was a great host, she was 100% responsive to all of our requests and questions before and during the trip. She was extremely thorough in all of her instructions on using the apartment and advice for navigating the city during our stay. I would definitely stay at this location again."
9460,18780071,2014-09-01,10544118,Patrick,"I cannot say enough about how FANTASTIC our experience was staying in Siena's property. The location is perfect, on the border between downtown and the eclectic and artsy Capitol Hill neighborhood. 

As for the room itself, we couldn't have been happier. Siena has put so much thought into making your stay comfortable...she gives you all the information you need prior to checkin, and keeps in contact throughout your stay to make sure you're well taken care of. The room itself is very nice, with a comfy bed and plenty of room to unpack and feel at home. 

We were quite impressed with the ""free bar,"" a fridge filled with complimentary goodies that really made us feel welcomed. Fresh blueberries and peaches, cheeses, fruit spreads, crumpets, milk, cereal, and selection of beer and wine...all of our breakfasts, and several snacks, we're taken care of!

Hands down, one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. I fully recommend staying in this location...I know I will next time I'm in Seattle!"
9460,19027278,2014-09-05,17605905,Debbie,"The place was spotless and Siena had stocked the fridge with goodies that us vegans could enjoy. The room is in a well kept building that is very close to all that downtown Seattle has to offer. Very easy to walk to pike market and the waterfront. 
I would highly recommend this listing as a great and economic place to stay. Siena gave us a gift card just for getting our own extra sheet from the dresser in the hall! Anything we needed was right there and she was very easy to get hold of.
I would definitely stay there the next time I'm in Seattle."
9460,19184371,2014-09-08,8031806,Christine,"A very friendly host who made us feel very welcome. Accommodation was as described and lots of little extras such as fruit, bottle of wine,chocolate, beer and tea/coffee making items. Excellent location just a short walk from the city centre and easy access to attractions. Definitely recommended."
9460,19364650,2014-09-11,17993862,Edwin,"Siena's place is perfect! She is so nice and friendly. She provided everything I need. Also, the location is great as it is just next to the convention centre, the Pike Place Market is just in walking distance. 
No matter you are visiting for business or travel, this place is a great place for staying. "
9460,19872772,2014-09-20,17129745,Valerie,Siena provided some very considerate touches that made us feel welcomed despite our late night arrival.  Her unit looked almost exactly like the photo complete with fresh flowers.  The location of her unit is ideal with convenient walking access to Downtown Seattle.
9460,20404935,2014-09-29,11856751,Trisha,From the beginning Siena ensured that I was well informed and catered for. I caught a taxi from King St station at a cost of $8 and found the instructions easy to follow. The apartment is in a central location and when booking tours I picked them up from the nearby Grand Hyatt. The room and facilities were very clean and comfortable. The shower was particularly good. I used the laundry in the building which was convenient. I especially appreciated the snacks and drinks left for me. I recommend that you try Siena's apartment when in Seattle. Also go to Bainbridge Island and The Museum of Flight. 
9460,20628660,2014-10-02,109801,Ken,Sienna was great !   Recommended.
9460,20732428,2014-10-05,5524752,Natalie,"Siena made sure we had a most enjoyable stay.  The room, which is in a self-contained section of a condominium, is very nicely furnished and, while cosy in size, has plenty of space for personal belongings.  What we appreciated most was the great care Siena took to look after us - fridge stocked with all we needed each day for a light breakfast, coffee and teas and some lovely additional touches like chocolate, wine and beer for us to enjoy.  The laundry facilities are good and we found parking for free using the zone ticket provided.  Location excellent -in walking distance of everything. It is near a freeway so some noise but  did not find this a problem. Great place to stay in Seattle. Check-in worked easily."
9460,21475737,2014-10-18,137044,Karen,This is a great find....in the heart of the city.  We loved being on the edge of Capital Hill (great restaurants within easy walk - we loved Odd Fellows restaurant and the Elliot Bay bookstore that stays open late) - and also to be able to walk to the Public Market.  Siena is a very experienced and gracious host!  The fridge was full of goodies - and supplies for everything we could want (and more!).  She is the most generous Airbnb host I've met!  Amazing!  The bed is comfy - and the attention to detail was lovely.  thank you Siena!
9460,21858427,2014-10-25,22737185,Rob,"An absolutely wonderful experience. A lovely place to stay, but the many thoughtful and welcoming touches make this a truly remarkable experience. From the fresh fruit awaiting me, the well stocked fridge with a variety of drinks and food, to the ample bathroom supplies with fresh towels and soap - this whole experience was great!

What was also very kind was the great lengths that Siena went to, in order to help me get the best out of my first trip to Seattle. When I arrived there was a printed email message on the desk that told me everything I needed to know about staying in her apartment, but also the best places to go in Seattle. 

I felt like I was staying with family and had true 'insider' knowledge about how to get around and enjoy Seattle. Plus, it was only a 10 minute walk to get to my conference location.

I also must say that Siena is a wonderfully warm host who is dedicated to ensuring that your stay is a positively memorable one. I shall try to come back for sure! My faith in humanity is restored! ;-) Brilliant.

"
9460,22011787,2014-10-28,15825550,Rachel,"Had a wonderful relaxing time.  Siena was so sweet and accommodating.  The room was as pictured and very comfortable.  Location was so perfect, walking distance to Convention Center, Pike's Place, and lots of downtown shops and restaurants.  Will definitely be coming back for my next trip to Seattle, thanks Siena! 

"
9460,22582801,2014-11-10,1407108,Heather,"Siena was a wonderful host! The room was cozy and comfortable with everything I needed, including yummy bread, fruit, cheese and wine. I would absolutely recommend staying with Siena next time you're in Seattle. Just off Pike street, perfect location to walk from. Super easy check-in too. "
9460,22822990,2014-11-16,3483639,Pete,Everything was as described in profile. We were completely satisfied. Room was comfortable and easy to leave and do the city. Close to everything and quiet and Safe... Siena made everything extra special with a flair. I would come back here any time I was in Seattle.
9460,22989841,2014-11-19,23268078,Sally,"This was my first experience of Airbnb and I was very pleased with how easy it was and how generous Siena has been. Check in was simple even though I was arriving late - the message left for me with cheese, wine, and chocolate were lovely. I slept very comfortably and was not bothered by the background traffic noise. This place is very convenient to the convention centre, and I found it easy to see the sights by walking from here. The room and bathroom were great, with everything I could possible need during my stay provided. Thanks Siena! "
9460,23063052,2014-11-22,21722475,Jill,"We throughly enjoyed our stay in Seattle and especially our downtown accommodations. 

Sienna Is a gracious host and provided literally everything you could possibly need and more!

Our space was lovely and a wonderful location . 

Thanks again for making our first trip to Seattle so memorable .

Jack & Jill Cahill"
9460,23685695,2014-12-08,11022858,Ian,Siena was a wonderful host! She really made sure I was comfortable and provided everything I needed for my stay! I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.
9460,23835023,2014-12-12,21531532,Robert,"Siena was a great Host.  She was quick to respond via Email and text.  She provided detailed directions on how to arrive at her Condo using various transportation methods from the SEA airport.  I chose to take the Light Rail and cancelled my rental car.  Her Condo is located in the heart of downtown Seattle and within easy walking distance of all the major sights and public transportation.
The Condo was very clean and nicely decorated.  Siena provided snacks, breakfast items, (cereal, yogurt, fruit, bagels, etc.) and beverages, (beer, wine, & bottled water).   I had forgotten to bring an umbrella…not to worry, two were provided.
Siena also had a list of local restaurants, grocery stores, and attractions with directions on how to reach them.  She definitely exceeded my expectations and I look forward to staying with her again on my return trips to Seattle.
"
9460,24150809,2014-12-21,23954872,Clemens,"Really nice apartment. I loved to stay there and perfect location to explore the city and experience the night life of the Capitol Hill as well.
The Bathroom is perfect and the room is very comfortable."
9460,24710314,2015-01-02,21569625,Annika,"Our host made us feel very welcome. We really appreciated the attention to detail, especially the snacks and drinks that made us feel at home from the get-go. The room, attached kitchenette, and bathroom were clean, comfortable and functional. 

 The room is centrally located to major attractions and points of interest. Seattle is a very walkable city and can be walked comfortably in a couple of days. We were very comfortable during our stay and the local references that our host supplied really made our stay much more enjoyable"
9460,25161721,2015-01-08,9775870,Ian,"Great stay!  The listing was just as described.  I stayed during an event at the Convention Center, for which it was awesome (especially considering that the ""conference hotel"" is not attached to the Center either, so you'll be walking outside and across a street in either case).  I easily walked my way around near the apartment for groceries and good restaurants within mere blocks; if you can bear to walk three-quarters of a mile, you'll have too many opportunities to count.  The bedroom and bathroom at the apartment are wonderful; no complaints.  I didn't see much of Siena during the visit, but she was always available over email and took care of my every request right away."
9460,25449290,2015-01-16,25694837,Katheirne,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Airbnb for the first time during our trip to Seattle.  We were both a bit nervous to try it out.  Our experience was wonderful.  Sienna is a great host who knows how to make guests feel welcome.  Little touches like remembering my boyfriends name even though I was the one who made the booking.  Siena is also incredibly approachable -  which makes her very reliable.  If you call or message her she will certainly respond in the most hallmark way you can imagine. She is very sweet. 
The room and bathroom are both very clean and comfortable.  The location is great!  We used Uber to get around to different neighborhoods and it was really inexpensive.  Feel free to use my code : katp156 for a free first ride (up to $20). 

Overall - because of the wonderful time I had here, I will certainly use AirBnb again.  Only now, I worry that the bar has been set too high! Thanks for the great stay!
"
9460,25538192,2015-01-19,22617982,Lalo,"Staying with Siena could only be described as an AirBnb dream! Not only was the location and amenities perfect. Siena went out of her  way to make us feel welcome with a mini continental breakfast, some beverages, and provided delicious coffee. The room was perfect for two, and close to everything in the heart of Seattle.  This was the best AirBnB i have yet to stay in. Siena was also very accessible through text and even helped me out with a mishap that occurred. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here and would definitely return here again.  

Thank you for making my first trip to Seattle a wonderful and comforting experience."
9460,25789031,2015-01-26,19661880,Amanda,"This place is very secure and as you walk to the end of the hallway, you'll see a mirror at the top of the door and that's the room. The room has a lock so you can have the feel of a hotel with the housekeeper across the hall. Siena is amazing for having a loaded fridge with fruits, bagels, beer, wine, juice and much more for FREE! The bathroom is stocked with towels, shampoo, body wash, cups, etc just like a real hotel! She is an amazing host providing us with a great stay and recommendations to places in Seattle! Thank you, Siena :)"
9460,25905336,2015-01-29,3272512,Matt,"Siena was very welcoming, and went way out of her way to make sure I felt at home. The ""breakfast"" part of B&B also included beer and wine in the fridge, fruit, snacks, and everything I could have wanted. Siena owns two private units off of a single hallway that everyone must use, but the room and bathroom feel private. Everything was clean and tidy, and even though the building isn't the newest it felt cozy and comfortable. The roof of the building is also amazing – on two different nights I took beers up there with a couple friends and enjoyed the beautiful view of the city at night. Great location and pleasant stay – would visit again!"
9460,26204711,2015-02-07,5140586,Jeff,"Simply Fantastic!  For start, it's in a great location, with down-town, public transport and tourist areas easy walking distance one way, and some great restaurants only minutes walk the other way. The place is great - comfortable, spotless, a great bed and private.  But what's amazing is the way Siena has thought of everything a traveller could need.  Not only is there a well stocked fridge with food and drink (how many places in the world have a free mini bar?), but every other small detail is catered for. And above all, Siena is the perfect host. I could not have felt more welcomed and could not recommend the place more highly.  Thanks Siena."
9460,26583672,2015-02-16,2109442,Harriet,"Cozy one bedroom, private bath with kitchenette was perfect for my stay in Seattle. A healthy walk up 43 steps to Freeway Park is your commute to the Convention Center. Siena is the best hostess and a warm hearted spirit. "
9460,27042875,2015-02-24,21334440,Laurie,"My daughter and I had a great stay at this location. Siena has a great eye for detail in decorating the room. It was nice and clean and beautifully decorated. Siena made sure to send out a detailed informational e mail to us prior to our stay regarding the room, area , parking etc. You can tell Siena is efficient because it helped out immensely. She made us feel very welcome by having coffee, milk and a few other snacks in the mini refrigerator. The neighborhood was great. Very nice people in Seattle and the room was within walking distance of Pikes Market, lots of restaurants, coffee places and so many shopping stores. The building entrance was very secure and we felt very safe walking around the neighborhood. We used the laundry room which made it very convenient and we went up to the roof top a few times to get some nice pictures of the city during the day & night.  
This is a great place to go be comfortable, relax and just have fun. We were there nearly a week and time flew bye. Cant wait to back again again to relax and unwind   :)"
9460,27500494,2015-03-06,6271096,Sherri,"Siena is a wonderful host!  The location of her condo is in perfect walking distance of so many things to do!   We walked to the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Science Center, Aquarium, Pikes Market Place, Underground Tour and many more....not to mention eating at multiple wonderful places all within walking distance of the condo.  Everything was ready for us when we arrived - even had parking available - which was perfect since we had rented a car!!  We utilized that laundry facilities and the upper deck which has a gorgeous view of downtown Seattle.  Cannot wait to go back again!!"
9460,27637477,2015-03-09,22211843,Katie,"From a friend who stayed with Siena in Seattle - ""We had a wonderful stay with Siena in Seattle. She made sure we had everything we needed and the space was clean and comfortable. The location was wonderful and easily walkable to Pike Place, downtown and Capitol Hill. She even surprised us with passes/discounts to many tourist destinations, as well as fresh flowers and fruit each morning. I'd highly recommend Siena's place! We had a delightful time and hope to return.""

9460,27858256,2015-03-13,1453601,Feng,"It is one great stay. Siena is super sweet and considerate. Enough food for breakfast. Enough guild for all my questions. She even gave me one ride to the airport,what else can I ask for? Big big thanks. Suzie"
9460,28381677,2015-03-23,25682853,Brianna,"Siena was very helpful and friendly. We were very well looked after and provided with all that we needed including excellent recommendations for dinner! Would particularly recommend ""Assagio's"" for dinner.

The room was comfortable and we had the pleasure of meeting Siena, who was lovely. We'd love to come back again soon!
"
9460,28693718,2015-03-29,21916941,Dominique,"The listing was perfectly located, just a few minutes from the hotel where my meeting was taking place. The owner provided very detailed directions to her place, as well as all kinds of useful information about how to get around the city and things to do. As this was my first time in Seattle, I really appreciated this information. The room and bathroom were very clean and pleasant. It was very nice to find some fresh fruit, good coffee, even a bottle of wine waiting for me. The internet worked right away. Siena was there, in the other part of the apartment, and she was really friendly and helpful. Overall a great experience."
9460,29014657,2015-04-02,539954,Lynette,This charming little space was thoughtfully stocked with everything I could have needed and more. I stay almost exclusively in rentals and Siena is one of the most considerate hostesses I have had the pleasure of meeting. She knows exactly what travelers need to feel comfortable and have a wonderful stay and she offers and so much more. It's all in the details that most overlook. She knows what she's doing and it shows.
9460,29165538,2015-04-05,11321959,Alex,"I had a great time staying here. I really liked the fact that it's just right behind the convention center so walking there was very short.  Sienna was a very nice host! She was very helpful with giving me directions to the apartment. She even recommended some listings on a few places with happy hour specials. The mini fridge was fully stocked and included a few adult beverages. Sadly I didn't get to drink them over the weekend since I was really busy at Sakuracon, but it was a nice touch! I would definitely come here again the next time I go to another convention :)"
9460,29812438,2015-04-13,24484192,Kathy,"Siena made our stay awesome! The room is perfect, has everything you need for your stay. She definitely gives the extra mile to make her guest feel comfortable. Everything that she offers you'll get and more. For us we were getting to Seattle a little earlier that the check in time and she was willing to keep our luggage and even give us a early check in. During our stay we got lucky and got to meet her and she was the loveliest, she even cared about us having a great time and recommended great places around the city that we could visit and even had some jackets for us to use during our stay. The location is perfect, we where visiting for a convention and it is less than a 5 minute walk to the entrance of the building, there are lots of good restaurants and locations to go and hang out during the night very near by. 

She really doesn't miss any detail and we really appreciated it, I could think about staying in any other place.  Hope next time we visit Seattle we can visit Siena again. "
9460,30130925,2015-04-18,4715723,Reese,"We stayed for 3 nights, and although we never actually met Siena or Nadia, we knew they were available if we needed anything. The suite was very clean and we had more than enough provided for us: from complimentary wine, chocolate, newspapers etc. to the small things like organic butter, which you don't notice at first but really seem to make a difference to make you feel at home. Nadia and Siena certainly went over and above our expectations and we would be happy to stay here again in the future. Thanks again!"
9460,30571405,2015-04-24,30713682,Norina,"I had a great time at Siena's place! I did not met her, but I knew that I could contact her in any case. The Room was clean and it is really easy to get around there, it is not far away from anything. To stay at the room from Siena made my trip totally perfect."
9460,31767818,2015-05-10,26693875,Gordon,"Sienna was the perfect host for the perfect trip! As my first time with AirBnB, I cannot wait to book my next! Accommodations were exactly as described and unit was beyond warm and welcoming! Easy access to the entire city and literally next door to the convention center. Also, the bed was much more comfortable than hotels. If you are ever booking near Seattle, you need Sienna!!!"
9460,32191764,2015-05-15,31696002,Cassandra,"Siena was a great host with a great apartment. It was very easy to get around Seattle and made even easier  by helpful suggestions. She left me and my friend snacks and drinks, and even refreshed them mid-stay. The access to roof decks was my favorite part. The skyline was beautiful in the morning with cofee made from the mini kitchenette. I would definitely stay with Siena again and recommend her to everyone."
9460,33062988,2015-05-25,463354,Tanya,"I stayed with Siena for 5 days & it was a great experience. Siena was very attentive via e-mail, and very sweet in person. The room is exactly as pictured, and the bed is gloriously comfortable. Her communication prior to arrival was clear & precise. What you don't see is that she has stocked the room with lots of extras such as fresh flowers, food, wine & beer in the minibar, washing detergent, tissues....there was nothing that I needed that I didn't have. The location is excellent and I, like the many others on AirBnB, would highly recommend staying with Siena in Seattle. Thank you Siena!!"
9460,33572134,2015-05-30,26674992,John,"Siena was the consumate hostess!  She made us feel welcome, starting several days before our visit.  She inquired into our needs, had extensive local information available and the accommodations were everything she said they would be; superb!  Siena is personable, pleasant and professional!  We would heartily recommend her and would love to stay here again, sometime in the future!  She made our stay in Seattle enjoyable!  Very convenient location, walking distance to Pike Market and fabulous restaurants."
9460,33959607,2015-06-02,34072539,Francisco,"Great host and place! 5 stars! We had the chance to speak to Siena she was very nice and always treating us! Everything super clean a fridge with food, wine and even beers! Excelent location in downtown very quiet. Better than an hotel for sure, will stay again. Thanks Siena!"
9460,34689446,2015-06-11,8240123,Karen,"Siena was so welcoming when we arrived. She thought of all the special touches. She had a cool drink and fresh fruit waiting for us in the room. The thoughtful things she did made our stay feel more like a vacation than work. The location is perfect for the Convention center. We walked through a lovely park to access the Convention center and it was less than a block away. The parking pass was a wonderful added bonus, we were able to park for free. Thank you Siena for making our stay so very special. 
Karen "
9460,34958199,2015-06-14,31583168,Scott,"This suite was everything advertised and then some.    The room was very comfortable and quiet. I arrived to a stocked refrigerator that included a nice bottle of wine to welcome me to Seattle.    

Having never been to Seattle before, I really appreciated all the great suggestions for local places to eat and drink as well as some really cool tourist activities that were provided.  

There is not much parking in the area but a car is really not needed as the building is within easy walking distance of many tourist activities such as Pike Place Market and central shopping district and public transportation (including the monorail, buses and Lite Rail)

All things considered, this suite was a far superior option to local hotels that cost twice the amount for less personable service.   I will definitely re-book this room if I am ever in Seattle again.  "
9460,35364459,2015-06-18,18688139,Roger,WOW .. great place and location. Siena was great and provided very detailed instructions. She was available as needed and made us feel right at home. Love the multiple USB charger connection for all my devices and the small desk to work! We had a very comfortable experience and will stay here again when back in Seattle. -- GREAT Place Siena!!
9460,35652268,2015-06-21,15009128,Mengqiao,The place is very nice and clean! Siena really tried best to make everyone comfortable in a nice little place just right next to downtown! The bed is super soft and the room is big enough for two person to stay for three days! We were able to find everything we need in the room! The location is great! We were able to hang around in downtown and just walk back to the place at night. Highly recommended to everyone who come to Seattle for a short visit!
9460,36023938,2015-06-24,33310878,Elyse,I can not say enough nice things about this place. I have traveled to 6 different countries and stayed in multiple places but this was by far my favorite. Sienna was absolutely wonderful and her space was so cozy! I highly recommend this place! You are in perfect walking distance to everything Seattle! If you are coming to Seattle this is the place to stay. Much better than a hotel! You will not be disappointed!
9460,36263942,2015-06-27,12764968,Belen,"Staying at Siena's was amazing. The detail she puts in your room and making it feel at home is wonderful. Although we didn't arrive as early as I thought, Siene was kind enough to have our room ready earlier than planned. We found nice treats by our door in the evenings after a long day out on the town. The location is perfect! Right by the convention center and very close to pikes fish market and a ton of shops and restaurants. If we ever come back we will definitely try to stay at Siene's again. Thank you For everything Siene!"
9460,36873291,2015-07-02,26322978,Byungil,"Siena was very welcoming to my visit. Everything was neat and clean when I arrived there. The house was just like the description written in aribnb. As for the location, I am sure you can go any downtown area by work. This choice was certainly my luck for this trip in Seattle. Thank you Siena, and I hope to visit your house again!

P.S. I liked your roof deck! It was great place to see the Seattle day and night!"
9460,37547764,2015-07-08,27899369,Justin,"We enjoyed our stay at Sienna's BnB! She was a very hospitable host. There was a lot of attention to detail: chocolates on the desk, drinks in the mini-bar, etc. We definitely recommend and would stay again if we find ourselves in Seattle!

9460,39149941,2015-07-21,13835974,New,"I had a five day stay and enjoyed the ambiance as well as the attention to detail that made my stay a lovely one. The  stocked kitchenette was delightful and well appreciated.  I have visited Seattle a number of times and I actually was introduced to some new fun things to see. 
Thumbs up to the Host and the thoughtfulness that was given to the smallest details. I will be back.

Everything was either within walking distance or public transportation was nearby. Siena was very accommodating and available. The mini fridge was stocked,  the fresh fruit and the beautiful fresh flowers were appreciated. She was very detailed with her directions, which was great and easy to follow. A completely awesome experience!"
9460,43026492,2015-08-17,30934649,Ryan,"Siena's place was excellent, and just as described in the listing! The location was great, within a short walk to many attractions, restaurants, and bars. As far as amenities, she exceeded our expectations as we were spoiled with fresh fruit, snacks, beverages, and even fresh flowers. In addition, she even offered us a ride to the airport! We really enjoyed our time in Seattle and would definitely recommend staying with Siena."
9460,43487980,2015-08-20,7704529,Ed,"Siena, thank you for being such a thoughtful hostess.  You really did think of everything!  We were pleased to find all the charming little touches - like chocolate bars next to the wine glasses; and a lovely bottle of Pinot Gris in the refrigerator. All of your printed out messages telling us everything we needed to know about the room (like how to make English muffin egg sandwiches using the microwave);  and about the surrounding area, including terrific restaurants and places to go, were all very appreciated and utilized.  The room and the bathroom with were both spotless! Thank you Nadia. :-)  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in your terrific space.  Thank you for making it so inviting.  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend your place to any of our friends or business colleagues.  We'll look forward to staying with you again the next time we're in the Seattle area.   All the best - Kari & Ed"
9460,44280516,2015-08-25,30769898,Stacey,"Excellent welcome and perfect accommodations for a long weekend getaway. Sienna was incredibly responsive, offered lots of local recommendations and did everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We greatly appreciated the bottle of wine and extra waters during our stay. Sienna is a tremendously thoughtful host. "
9460,45237994,2015-09-01,30222201,Dylan,"Overall Experience: A+++++++++!

We were staying in Seattle for the PAX Prime 2015 convention.

Everything about our stay was fantastic. Our host Siena (CC) went far above and beyond our expectations. We had some surprise, last-minute special requests and CC was very flexible and helped us to make it work. The location is perfect for anything related to the Seattle Convention Center--it's a two-minute walk around the corner. And you will be treated warmly and respectfully by CC.

The lodgings are better than hotels we've stayed in in the downtown area and much better-stocked -- a full fridge with materials for making breakfast, coffee, and so on. It is more than you'd ever need!

We are looking forward to booking with CC next year for PAX 2016. Book with her, you will not be disappointed!"
9460,46115280,2015-09-08,3766012,Lore,Our stay at Siena's was great! The room is lovely and the location great. Siena was very kind and helpfull and the breakfast items she left us were plenty. Also the basket with beers and popcorn one night was a real treat. We would certainly stay there again!
9460,46695874,2015-09-13,1014088,Luiz,"Siena is the most delightful host one can desire. The location was great,she was generous with food and drinks in the room and the bed was first class. Top 3 of my many AirBnb experiences!!"
9460,47256962,2015-09-17,38803954,Chelsea,"Siena was great! When I came in, there was wine and chocolate waiting...which was so welcomed after having my amtrak delayed two hours! The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and cozy. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable, usually I am an insomniac and for the most part I slept incredibly well because the bed was so comfortable. Siena stocked the mini fridge with water, beer, juice, and milk. She provided coffee, tea and the fixings, as well as fruit. What was really helpful was that she provided a heartier breakfast in the form of english muffins and eggs for your own ""homemade egg mcmuffin"" which was very helpful both time-saving and money-saving wise; I had my breakfasts covered the whole time I was there. She also has all your bathroom needs met if you forgot something. The location is very good for exploring downtown and you can easily walk or take public transportation. The last night I was there she even provided extra water and cookies! Siena was so helpful with regard to getting me to the airport; initially I was going to just take a shuttle but she was heading in the SeaTac direction so she gave me a ride. I am not used to a big city like Seattle, and it was a little overwhelming but Siena's airbnb made me feel like I had somewhere cozy to rest every night in Seattle. If I ever needed accommodations in Seattle, I would definitely head back to Siena's!"
9460,47630376,2015-09-21,29245752,Angie,"My experience at Siena's condo was exceptional. Every need is anticipated and provided for, as she puts great time and attention to detail for her guests. She accommodated my request for early check in and even gave me a lift to the airport! I was so happy to get to actually meet her and talk with her. 

I came to Seattle for both business and pleasure, and the location was the real star of the show for me. I was able to walk everywhere very easily. The only time I had to use Uber was to avoid the rain my first afternoon. Fortunately, the weather was quite beautiful and mild while I was here, so walking was a pleasure. Located right off of Pike St., it's just a couple of blocks down to the many adventures of the Pike Street Market. It's about 10 minutes up to the Space Needle area. I walked to the waterfront area as well as the Ferry terminal with no problem. I walked through Bell Town and Pioneer Square, and all were well within walking from Siena's unit. For convenience, I can't think of any other area that would have been better...noise level was low, but it was close enough to everything. 

The unit itself is beautifully decorated, the bed is very comfortable, there is plenty of storage space for hanging clothes as well as drawer space. The mini-fridge was stocked with essentials and was very helpful in the mornings for me, as I was still on east coast time. It was great to be able to make my own coffee and have a bowl of cereal. The bathroom was scrupulously clean and the shower was great. You do have to walk across the hall, but it's your own private bath and I found that to be no problem at all. I only checked out the rooftop deck one afternoon, and it was very nice--would have been wonderful for a couple. 

I can give the highest recommendation to Siena and this listing. It exceeded all expectations and would happily stay here again if I return to Seattle. It was truly like being in a friend's home rather than a cold hotel. "
9460,48270732,2015-09-25,33696195,Asako,"My boyfriend and I had a memorable time at her place.  This cute and tidy place is easy to go downtown so that we could enjoy the night scene of Seattle.  Siena is awesome host making earlier check in, putting some food and drinks in a fridge ( fruits, English muffins, yogurt, beer, wine and more!).  Driving us to the airport as well.  I'd like to stay here again!"
9460,50461740,2015-10-12,41948666,Hansa,"There were fresh flowers and dark chocolates in the room. Chilled bottles of wine, beer and perfect food varieties in the refrigerater. We enjoyed the red grapes and making and having egg and cheese for breakfast. The highlight of our stay was to look at the falling maple leaves from the beautiful trees and the mornig rain from the windows."
9460,50832731,2015-10-15,37181558,Chelsea,Absolutely loved this place. Clean and so close to everything. We were able to walk to everything.
9460,51112059,2015-10-18,36302283,Carolyn,"Siena was the most welcoming host imaginable––she went out of her way to make sure our stay in her lovely room was was as pleasant and comfortable as she could make it. Right from the start she surprised me with an offer of a parking space when I hadn't told her ahead of time that we needed it.  Chocolate, fresh raspberries and wine were all ready for us on our arrival––wow! The bedroom decor is lovely, exceptionally clean and the bed is fantastic––as comfortable as mine at home and I didn't think any could rival that. In addition, Siena left clear, well written instructions about how to access WiFi and other services and everything worked exactly as explained. The room was quiet, private and Siena provided robes for the across the hall bathroom that was sparkling clean and stocked with soaps and other necessities. Thank you Siena! If I lived nearby, I'd return again and again."
9460,51603809,2015-10-22,27764530,Cj,"My expectations of my trip were huge,  and having found what looked to be accommodation that seemed too good to be true... Well.....Fret not!!! Siena is the real deal!!! 

The apartment building is in a great location for walking,  buses,  taxis and UBER 

The room is gorgeous,  the bed is ridiculously comfortable - Siena has a supply of DVD's,  heaps of information on Seattle and things to do,  and the most amazing wee kitchenette which was supplied with water, milk, juice,  beer and wine, muffins (eggs,  cheese and butter also supplied),  cereal.... So generous!! The shower is amazing,  shampoo,  mouthwash,  soap supplied - talk about going above and beyond... 

Then there's the little treat fairy,  when arriving home after sightseeing there were biscuits and other goodies... Bringing a smile of delight every time. 

I was lucky enough to meet Siena and she is hilarious,  generous, kind and not forgetting ""a clever wee sausage"". 

I loved my time in Seattle, and having spent time @ 1400 Hubbell Place, and meeting Siena,  I have had the trip of a lifetime and made a friend for life. "
9460,52314205,2015-10-28,5887844,Susan,"We enjoyed our stay at Siena's place. It is cute, comfortable and cozy.  Siena's hospitality was way above and beyond what was expected.  We just kept exclaiming to each other with awe. She provided food to our taste, surprise snacks and advice on many aspects of our trip. She even selected a video and book especially for us and put it on our bed to greet us.  She didn't ask us to do cleaning chores as some hosts do.  I highly recommend staying with Siena. "
9460,52822942,2015-11-02,30662873,Annemarie,"The host did everything to make me feel welcome and comfortable: from having a stocked refrigerator to flowers.
The apartment is conveniently located in downtown Seattle near the convention center. Walking to Pike public market was a treat!"
9460,53240668,2015-11-07,18615922,Natasha,"I was most impressed with the value that I receive from the stay. There was so much food and she even allowed my brother to stay with me (who is a University of Washington student) without additional charge. 
That was generous. 

Other than that, I didn't see much of Siena and I had the privacy and space I needed. 

The location is fantastic - I was a single female traveler and I managed to go to all the attractions just by walking. Starbucks Reserve is only a 4-min walk from the condo.

Also, if you are coming to Seattle for a conference at the Washington State CC, book this place. I was able to come and go as often as I needed because the distance was really short. 

Overall, she deserves the AirBnB Superhost title!
"
9460,54700627,2015-11-23,41966495,Jesus,The host made us feel welcome. I love the welcome basket. Great location close to pikes place everything was walking distance. We found parking easily. Would recommend to others the room looked just like the photos.

9460,55716546,2015-12-05,15588483,Chua,"Great location, away from the buzz yet in downtown! It was great talking to Siena and she is always just a message away! "
9460,56964393,2015-12-20,37327432,Carol,Sienna met us and gave us a parking spot as the street was packed. Plus she stocked the  mini bar was customized for our diet needs .
9460,57370780,2015-12-25,30865445,Leslie,We loved how Siena was so kind enough to let us check in early and then stay as long as we needed to stay before leaving for Portland on Christmas . The space was nice and we loved the bed. My scoliosis feels better than ever. The kitchen saved our chances of starvation during the holidays when things were closed. Siena even was so kind to give us gifts on Christmas. Although we didn't talk much I felt like she is a friend to us. She's a beautiful person inside and out. You need to stay here to enjoy your trip to Seattle to its fullest.
9460,57958576,2015-12-30,51870435,Patricia,"Great place!  Very clean and stocked with all the essentials, and then some.  Walking distance from all the cool things to do in the city.  Host is accommodating to help your stay and departure go as smooth as possible, thanks!"

The place itself was very nice and clean and laid out well. I slept like a rock and felt super safe and secure.
Nice amenities and the 1 time I needed something Kevin responded instantly and was super helpful and friendly!"

8926188,53273275,2015-11-07,3221441,Montserrat,Very comfortable and well located apartment. The host was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Very good experience. 
8926188,54667198,2015-11-22,26412668,Holly,We never actually met Kevin but he was so quick to respond via text and let us know what to except or offer help if we needed anything. His house was perfect for our stay in Seattle!!!! close in a great neighborhood for walking to fun palaces and a great base camp for a few days in the heat of Capitol Hill. Thanks for a great stay !

When we needed some additional info, he replied quickly and kindly.  We much appreciated the coffee, water and snacks. We'd stay again! "
8926188,56495934,2015-12-14,47730316,Adi,"Pros: 
- Kevin was very responsive at all times, including over text. It never took more than a few min to hear back from him. 
- The neighborhood is great -- lots within walking distance to explore. - The place itself was really nice and cozy with a nice kitchen + things to cook/eat with. Plenty of space for 2 or more people. Extra sheets + blankets were provided for the sofa bed.

Cons: 
-The rest of the building is being remodeled, so there was sometimes construction noise, including at some pretty odd times (up until 10pm on a Saturday night). It was never really loud enough to wake you up, but was a bit odd given the timing. 
- The main heating vent is in the bedroom, so that gets pretty warm while the rest of the unit can be a bit chilly.
- Sofa bed is pretty old, and was hard to pull in and out. Not the most comfortable to sleep on.

8683011,52938258,2015-11-02,633774,Fontaine,"Daniel's spot was a great room in central Fremont. He and his roommates were super friendly and invited me to join them for dinner and hanging out. Since the room was on the first floor and the living room was on the second floor, it was easy for me to hang out with folks but retire easily to my room when I needed to work. They were also super generous and offered me beer and hot tea. Great hosts!"
8683011,53726478,2015-11-11,575485,Andrew,"Daniel and Darcy were excellent hosts--when I arrived they made me feel at home and I had a great time getting to know them a little. The bedroom is the only room on the ground floor, so when I went to bed, I felt like I had a nice amount of privacy as well. I traveled for business, so was in and out very quickly, but overall a great place and I'd be happy to stay here again."
8683011,54947260,2015-11-25,13545649,Richard,"Dan, Darcy & Sam were most congenial hosts, and the room was pleasant with a comfortable bed.  I enjoyed my stay in Fremont, hope I'll have the opportunity to visit again.

They also shared knowledge of the area to help this out-of-towner feel comfortable and at ease. I felt very comfortable in their presence since this was my first experience with AirBnB. "
689309,3317399,2013-01-09,214728,Louise,"Philippe and his family were friendly and welcoming hosts, always concerned about our comfort. They were flexible in times for our arrival, and made sure we knew our way around the apartment and the neighborhood.  The accommodations, including the king-size bed and private entrance were more than comfortable!  Having a separate tv / coffee room at the entrance, including a futon, was a bonus.  We certainly never felt crowded. The decor and amenities felt luxurious.
    We were there visiting our grandchildren and stayed in the apartment little time. However, after one of us had to leave Seattle early because of a family emergency Philippe and Siham even brought crepes for a special breakfast to console the one left behind.
  Our only caveat for long-term guests is that you should be aware the quarters were limited in space and equipment for cooking and eating meals.  There was only a coffee maker and a nice toaster oven, as well as a small refrigerator. This was a new rental when we visited, so the hosts may change that in the future.
  Overall, we can't say enough nice things about the apartment and our hosts. We hope to go back soon and won't hesitate to stay there again.

The bedroom is very comfortable and the Bed was that of a presidential suite. The bathroom was clean and easy to use. The living room offered a TV and a fridge, microwave and use for a weekend getaway. Philippe left some drinks and was there to help with anything we needed. They are very flexible with check- in and check-out which is very nice if thing happen to change! They will give advice on what to do during your stay in Seattle and the location is close to University District and many stores and restaurants. If you are looking for a place to stay- this is a HAVE TOO! I will definitely return! 

Thank you Philippe & Siham for such a great stay!"
689309,11387223,2014-03-31,5409371,Nicole,"Phillipe was above and beyond in terms of friendly, available, hospitable and the care he has put into the space. It was very luxurious and comfortable and he has thought of everything. Hope to stay here again when I'm back in town! "
689309,11523118,2014-04-06,11319077,Jenna,"We stayed at Phillipe's for a week. He was very helpful and accommodating, and the apartment was quiet, convenient, and relaxing. The high end furnishings made us comfortable while we were away from home and the blooming backyard garden was a breath of fresh air. We would recommend staying here."
689309,11762443,2014-04-14,5492466,Elizabeth,"Philippe was very welcoming.  The suite was perfect for my two nights.  The bed was huge and very comfortable.  Everything was very clean and well decorated: the towels were extremely thick and fluffy: very luxurious!

The garden outside was in its springtime glory, a beautiful picture out the living area window.  

The suite was in a great neighbourhood for me: close to where I was meeting and not far from downtown Seattle and Kirkland.  I enjoyed my stay very much."
9494415,55985246,2015-12-07,49739635,Alicia,"Great convenient location, clean, and Eric was easy to communicate with. The room was small but had everything we needed to feel comfortable for a short stay. "
9494415,56229379,2015-12-10,48285283,Carley,Amazing place! Had a great stay! Really loved the view from the roof. 
9494415,56347866,2015-12-12,1834276,Jerry,"My trip (very first) to Seattle started off amazingly by staying at Eric's. The building itself is beautifully designed, with more amenities and open spaces than any other place I've stayed at. Each floor has a common lounge/kitchen area, as well as laundry, which was a very smart thing to include. My room was set up like a micro-studio, and felt very hip and modern, which added to my experience in Seattle.

Eric himself was so helpful and detailed so that I was left with absolutely no questions in terms of checking in or accessing any of the ammenities.

I would recommend (weather permitting) that everyone who stays here have a cup of coffee on the roof, with its great view. Location itself is a nice short walk to two main strips of stores, restaurants, and coffee ships. I am already thinking of my next trip to Seattle and will be booking with Eric again."
9494415,56571967,2015-12-14,50880222,Keiana,I enjoyed staying here at Erics unit. The space was very clean and stocked with snacks like popcorn and refreshments in the mini fridge. All the little things you need were there like clean towels and tissues. The space was very cute and quaint but definitely much smaller than I imagined but it delivered privacy and the WiFi was great! I had a great time and I truly recommend this space for someone who just wants a quiet place to sleep.
9494415,56939080,2015-12-20,49192634,Reid,"Eric's listing was fantastic. He recently built the whole building, and you can tell that he has put a lot of thought into the property. The room itself was satisfactory (comfy bed, warm shower, sink, closet). Some things I found very convenient were the keycode locks, and the useful appliances located within the room itself, (hot water boiler, blow dryer). The location was super easy for getting around in the city. It's a 3 minute walk to Broadway and essentially a 25 minute walk to downtown. The roof has a great view of the city. Definitely recommend as a home-base for young people doing business in the city. "
9494415,57329616,2015-12-24,17078614,Braden,We absolutely loved this place! Eric was a terrific host. He got us our info quickly and was very responsive to questions. The room was exactly as described. Perfect for our pre-holiday getaway. Park nearby for the morning run. Great neighborhood for dinner nearby. A terrific contribution for our trip to Seattle. We will be back!
9494415,57496106,2015-12-26,52176492,Alex,"Eric took us in on short notice for multiple days with no complaints when me and my fiancée were stranded in Seattle. Room setup is nice for a couple, it feels cozy and private. There's cabinets to leave your stuff in and the kitchens are well stocked with utensils and pots and pans to make your own food
Most products available in the rooms are organic which is also nice. The other guests we met were really nice, which definitely brightened up our day. Would come back again if we stayed in Seattle again."
1209255,5493528,2013-07-02,6017248,William,"Dan was a terrific host.  His home was a great stay for my mother & siblings to stay while in town for my brother's wedding.  It's a terrific location, with lots of space.  "
1209255,5773309,2013-07-15,7362823,In,"Dan was a fantastic host and his home was just as described.  Fantastic place on Queen Anne in Seattle; close to everything!  Being a first time airbnb user, I was a bit unfamiliar with the process but Dan walked me through step by step and made it as simple as can be.  Emily and I had a wonderful weekend in Seattle.  Thanks Dan and Suzanne for sharing your wonderful house with us!"
1209255,5973268,2013-07-24,2159022,Tim & Mary,"Dan and Suzanne's place was great, about a $35 taxi ride from the airport. It is situated a very short walk from some lovely shops/cafes and to the local buses. The house was wonderful and exactly as pictured. It could comfortably sleep 3 couples, possibly a fourth if you didn't mind sharing bathrooms. The house is large so that if you're travelling with another couple, there is quite a bit of space for privacy. The beds were also very comfortable. WiFi was fast and the house was very clean as pictured.

Although this part of Queen Anne is up on a hill, walking around the local neighborhood was quite flat. If you want to walk North to Fremont, that's a very hilly walk (downhill there, uphill back)! The walk south is quite nice with a gentle slope down to Kerry Park with a great view of Seattle.

Communication with Dan was great before the stay and we had no need to chat during our stay as everything went smoothly. Thanks again for having us in your house and we'll be sure to try and stay here on our next trip to Seattle."
1209255,6200233,2013-08-03,2518131,Marcus,"Our team had a wonderful (business) stay at Dan's place! All clean, spacious and well-arranged. The pre-arrival communication with him was perfect, he helped a lot and provided full information on all the handling. We couldn't have been more pleased with him as a host. Thanks a lot! 
~Phil"
1209255,6547741,2013-08-16,8034194,Devin,"Dan and Suzanne helped make my family's visit to Seattle amazing. Their house is simply beautiful was perfectly located next to the points of interest in upper Queen Anne. The cleaning and presentation was immaculate. We also enjoyed using the Apple TV hooked up in the entertainment room and easily navigated the electronics. We stayed during the month of August and the house was cool and comfortable the entire time! Suzanne gave us some great recommendations for the area too. Overall, it was fantastic!"
1209255,6762626,2013-08-24,4955329,Isadora,"My family and I loved our stay at Dan and Suzanne's home. The location is perfect. It's residential and everything is in walking distance. We shopped at the local butcher and grilled a few amazing meals and used the  well equipped kitchen. We had several memorable brunches and dinners at neighborhood restaurants. The bakeries were so delectable. 

I recommend staying at Dan and Suzanne's house. They were very easy to communicate with and book with ease. The house is very spacious, comfortable, and well decorated. "
1209255,6872927,2013-08-28,7526336,Andy,This is an absolutely wonderful home. 6 of us were in Seattle for 4 days for a wedding and it was perfect. Very nice and spacious accommodations in the perfect area (Queen Anne). Dan and Suzanne were wonderful hosts and provided everything we needed (including a nice document on where to find everything in the area). Definitely recommended!
1209255,7013020,2013-09-03,7533522,Ryan,"Dan was an excellent host! He was very responsive before, during, and after our stay. Dan as very good about checking to make sure everything was satisfactory. The house in Queen Anne is in an amazing location and an amazing place to stay!!!"
1209255,7203250,2013-09-10,5329097,Alex,Dan and Suzanne have a great home. It was nice to stay out of the loud city. The neighborhood is very calm. The drive or taxi ride to the city and restaurants out of walking distance was easy. Cab drivers were a bit odd though... Didn't know the city at all. Overall great stay no complaints. Had more than enough for 4of us. Thanks again! 
1209255,7370265,2013-09-17,8117498,M.Christine,"This was my first experience using airbnb. I usually use vrbo. Everything went smoothly and I will use airbnb in the future. Dan and Suzanne got back to me quickly and there were no glitches. The house is comfortable--mattresses were good. The location was great. The neighborhood is very safe and there are many things within walking distance (grocery store, drug store, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.). 
I have never rented a house before where the owners left many groceries in the fridge and little room in the closets . It surprised me but overall the experience was favorable. If I go back to Seattle I would rent this house again. "
1209255,8676932,2013-11-11,9807190,Charles,"We had an excellent experience at Dan and Suzanne’s home. The home was exactly as advertised …a beautiful house, very nice neighborhood, close to the city, comfortable, clean, and fully supported by the hosts. We would happily stay there again in the future. A few very minor issues came up that are hardly worth mentioning and no big deal at all …the hot water heater did not really support five adults showering in the morning (we just staggered our showers between evening & morning) and there was a bad smell in the refrigerator (we did not need the refrigerator and Dan offered to fix it but we said it was OK). Please do not let these minor issues keep you away from this great house.
Thank you, Suzanne and Dan, for sharing your home with us. We had a lot of fun in Seattle.
"
1209255,9014249,2013-12-02,8094430,Newby,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were thoroughly impressed.  Dan was very helpful with all my questions prior to our arrival in Seattle. Once we arrived, the house was perfect for our family. The 3 BR/2 BA is the perfect size for the 6 of us. We rented over the Thanksgiving weekend, so we cooked on Thursday & they were very gracious in having a nearly empty fridge & offering us the use of all their kitchen items, so we didn't have to bring them. There was plenty of room for all of us to relax, watch TV, or sit on their lovely front porch. The location of their house to the Queen Anne commercial area is terrific......only 3 blocks. 

Our son is in Seattle for 4 years & we'll definitely return to Dan & Suzanne's. Many thanks !!"
1209255,11354190,2014-03-31,4615915,Elizabeth,Had a wonderful weekend in Seattle meeting up with family and sharing meals here at Dan and Suzanne's lovely home in the fabulous Queen Anne neighborhood. Great walking area. This home is exactly what airbnb is about. Great hosts. 
1209255,12333885,2014-04-29,2070963,Leticia,"I just love when the host instructions are clear, first night access is easy and doesn't depend in making arrangements to meet at very specific time.
Dan and Susanne were great hosts. Their instructions and suggestions were both lovely and clear. 
The house is very comfortable, looks exactly like the photos and it was impeccably clean. Crisp fresh carpets, soft abundant linens. Incredibly well equipped kitchen, powerful washer and dryer and for me the highlight: Superb library :) I started 2 books over there that I had to buy afterwards hehe
My daughter loved playing and running around in the fenced in backyard while we grilled and relaxed. 
We are looking forward to next time we need to go to Seattle staying at Dan and Suzanne's again.
"
1209255,12775772,2014-05-11,12214018,Joan,What a great house! We had a girls' get-together in Seattle and really enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and comfy and in a great neighborhood. Awesome hosts too!
1209255,13784553,2014-06-04,13680591,Jeff,This really is the perfect home in the perfect neighborhood.  Dan was extremely helpful and easy to work with.  Could not recommend this home or these people more.  Will stay here every time I go to Seattle
1209255,14072765,2014-06-11,8916302,Jon And Marne,"We had a wonderful time at Dan and Suzanne's. The place was perfect for our needs. We were visiting for a week for our son's wedding and we're happy to have such a comfortable home in a wonderful neighborhood. Queen Anne is the place to stay in Seattle. Everything you need is in walking distance and the city is just down the hill. The neighborhood was quiet, the house was nicely appointed. We had the downstairs bedroom and our daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter were upstairs. Plenty of room. The back yard was awesome. Parking was no problem. Dan and Suzanne were easy to communicate with and everything was ready for us when we got there. Highly recommended!!!"
1209255,14201271,2014-06-14,2133243,Rachel,"We absolutely loved this place!  Rather than get a hotel for a work conference, 3 of us rented Dan and Suzanne's place.  It was very nice, clean and absolutely perfect.  We loved the neighborhood, and yoga studio's nearby.  I would definitely stay here again!"
1209255,15567540,2014-07-12,12095912,Kathy,"The house was great!  It gave us the space and privacy we all needed, as we were traveling with our two adult daughters and a son-in-law.  We were even able to host a dinner for our extended family from Seattle, which was perfect!  We were only a few short blocks from coffee shops and restaurants, which was definitely convenient!  The garden in the back of the house was so enjoyable to enjoy coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening.  "
1209255,16199635,2014-07-23,14090621,Paul,"Six of us stayed 5 nights and were very comfortable. Everything was exactly as advertised. What an awesome home, and neighborhood. Good restaurants, pubs, and shopping within walking distance. Bus stop right around the corner will take you into downtown Seattle if you prefer not to drive. A peaceful backyard to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing was welcomed!"
1209255,16539855,2014-07-29,11037480,Diane,"Our hosts, Dan and Suzanne, welcomed us before our arrival with an e-mail that gave us necessary and helpful information about their home and environs.  The home and yard are as shown on the airbnb listing.  We enjoyed gathering in the gracious interior living spaces and on the deck.  The layout, master bedroom and bath on the main floor and two bedrooms and bath on the second floor, worked very well for our group which consisted of one couple and two singles.  We particularly like the art sprinkled throughout the house.  The location is excellent; a two block walk to the the Queen Anne neighborhood shops and restaurants and 5-10 minute drive to the center of Seattle.   Our sole disappointment was that there was no internet (or tv, but that's of less importance).   There are so many uses for internet when traveling that this was quite frustrating.  Dan and Suzanne did apologize and return $75 to compensate for this inconvenience.   We would rate this 5 stars had the internet been working as we liked everything else about this home.    "
1209255,16882211,2014-08-04,12113161,Barb,"Dan and Suzanne have a lovely and spacious home, and were very accomodating in making us feel comfortable.  Their home is in a wonderful neighborhood, with easy and close access to a grocery stores, shops, Starbucks, a few restaurants/bars, and a bus stop.  Their listing was very accurate!  It was a little odd that there were no screens on many of the windows, but we left them open to enjoy the cool air and didn't encounter any bugs."
1209255,18296817,2014-08-25,1566944,Christof,Beautiful house in a beautiful and calm neighborhood. A stay in Seattle can't be an better. Could not imagine to have a nicer place to stay.
1209255,18870982,2014-09-02,4934334,Jc,"Dan and Suzanne have a beautiful, clean , quiet and cozy home.  We had a perfect vacation staying in their home. The location is unbeatable, just steps from amazing restaurants, shopping, grocery stores, several gyms and yoga studios, a great park and community pool. This is one of the very best locations in Seattle . I highly recommend this lovely house and wonderful hosts."
1209255,25607986,2015-01-20,25590251,Frank,"The Caine's home is warm, relaxing and comfortable.  In addition to being situated in the Queen Ann neighborhood, their home makes you feel like your are a local.  You are 15 minutes from downtown Seattle in a very quiet neighborhood.  We would not hesitate to stay there again on return visits.  Excellently located - within walking distance - to the family we were visiting.  It would be hard to do better in this neighborhood."
1209255,29404592,2015-04-07,24660950,Sean,"My whole family stayed at this beautiful house right on top of Queen Anne Hill for a weekend and had a wonderful time. Dan and Suzanne were amazing hosts, very organized, and made us feel welcome in their home. This was the most comfortable way to travel, felt like we could finally relax. "
1209255,30334232,2015-04-20,30511855,Serena,"the neighborhood was incredibly charming and Queen Anne is a very special spot in the Seattle Area.  It is also, 7-10 mins from Downtown which is great bc you get the best of both worlds.  The city is insanely busy, it's great to spend an afternoon shopping, but to stay there your whole trip, would not be fun.  IT was so nice to come back to charmville and relax with good food and good shopping.  The house was perfect, welcoming, warm and had all the amenities you might need.  Dan and Suzanne will very helpful on every request or question we had.  The location from Queen Anne to this property is a block!  really amazing."
1209255,30751248,2015-04-26,31657628,Ellie,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1209255,33094536,2015-05-25,18844901,Kimberly,"We loved the house and neighborhood! Everything was just as expected.  Our family had room to spread out, we enjoyed sitting on the back deck and the short walk to so many wonderful restaurants.  We love Seattle and being able to enjoy it as a ""local"" instead of at a hotel was perfect.  Suzanne even went above and beyond and mailed a necklace my daughter had bought at Pike Place market back to us in Tempe.  We would enjoy staying here again"
1209255,33982616,2015-06-03,22001431,Karl,"The house is perfectly as described.  I can't say enough about the location of this house.  It is a 5 min walk from Queen Anne Ave, which has so many cool restaurants and bars.  There is a Safeway and Trader Joe's walking distance from the house.  It's a $5-6 Uber ride to Ballard, Fremont, and Pike Place market.  It is a 45 minute walk to the market or Fremont (all downhill), if you preferred walking.  
As far as the house itself - it is big.  There is plenty of space for me, my brother, and parents.  Three comfortable beds and two full baths.  We bought some seafood from the market and cooked in the house one night.  The kitchen has everything you need and the grill had plenty of propane.  Everything was clean as well.  The backyard is spacious and nice for enjoying a glass of wine on the patio.  One thing I wasn't accustomed to was everybody keeping their windows open at night.  So you have to be cognizant of neighbors in the evening outside with music and talking.  "
1209255,34408947,2015-06-08,16875289,Ashley,This property was just as described. Dan and Suzanne were very responsive and accommodating. We had a wonderful time here and would happily rent this house again! The beds were comfy and the location was perfect for walking to restaurants and amenities. 
1209255,35064515,2015-06-15,3793641,Barbara,"We really enjoyed our stay in Queen Anne.  The house was just as pictured and a very pleasant place to pass the time.  The bedrooms were lovely and comfortable and the house was clean and well organized.
Suzanne stopped by to water new landscaping but notified us first and was discrete.  
We used the back patio for a family gathering and the two grills, gas and charcoal, made it all very easy.  
A great find!"
1209255,35907702,2015-06-23,17240967,Carly,"The house was as lovely as it looked on the website. My family and I had no complaints. The instructions were easy to follow, and they offered added information about their favorite places to visit in the city. Nothing bad to be said!"
1209255,36911820,2015-07-02,14286603,Robert,"We enjoyed our stay in Dan and Suzanne's house in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.   They were very responsive and clear with the communication regarding the stay, entering the house, using the appliances, etc.   We loved staying in that neighborhood; there are a lot of cute cafes and shops, and the running trails were not too far away."
1209255,37321430,2015-07-06,6011352,(email hidden),"Dan and Suzanne's home was terrific, and I thought they were outstanding throughout the process.  The home is located in a wonderful part of Queen Anne, and the house is maintained in an excellent condition.  I found Dan and Suzanne to be very responsive both prior to our trip and during it when questions arose.  I would not hesitate to rent this home.  Thank you, Dan and Suzanne!  Charlie"
1209255,44414823,2015-08-26,34080011,Ryan,"I’ll start with the neighborhood. It’s fantastic. The house is located right in the middle of tons of cool stuff. We were able to walk to so, so much. One day, we even walked to the Space Needle (downhill--easy!) and back (uphill--not as easy). As far as parking goes, we never had a problem parking on the street at the house (three cars for three families). From here, I took lovely morning and late-evening runs to Pike’s Place Market, along the canal, past the Space Needle, across the bridges. I didn’t know where I was going, but it felt safe and was so picturesque. The house sits only a block from Trader Joe’s, Safeway, Storyville Coffee, Cupcake Royale, etc. etc. 

The lawn is lovely, and the kids loved playing outside in the yard. The grass is plush and soft—so green. Being from LA, we’re used to most lawns being some shade of brown. We used the propane grill, which was gassed up and ready to go. We used, cleaned, and covered it back up. Having a grill at our disposal—and making our own dinner—was a great experience. 

Suzanne and Don's listing was accurate—and maybe the house was even better than I expected. It definitely beat staying in some big hotel downtown.

We had only a few minor niggles. I texted Don and let him know, and he texted back. But there was nothing that needed immediate attention, so the trip went swimmingly:
1) The lightbulbs in the downstairs bathroom fixture were burnt out. I changed out the lightbulbs with ones from a lamp in the front room.  
2) The door knob was broken on the upstairs bathroom, so it would just fall off. 
3) The towel rods fell off in the bathroom. I finger-tightened the set screw on the downstairs rod, and it was fine. This was minor.

A non-niggle for us:
1) Suzanne said the downstairs toilet might be finicky. The first night, I heard it constantly running. The flapper wasn’t seated, and it looked like the chain was wrapped around itself. I untangled it and it was fine for our entire stay. 
"
1209255,45467571,2015-09-03,3644622,Bridget,"My family and I had a fabulous time! Great location. Beautiful house. Lots of space, for lots of family, in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance."
1209255,53062010,2015-11-04,24144825,Daniel,The neighborhood is fantastic! Short walk to restaurants and shops. We visited in early November and the fall color was top notch.
1095207,5603278,2013-07-08,3633489,Charlotte,"Such a lovely home to stay at while exploring Seattle! We had a large group and there were plenty of very comfortable beds and towels for everyone. The host was very accommodating when it came to our arrival and departure schedule as well.

Finally, this house has so much character! There's an amazing entertainment room in the basement, a reading alcove in the attic, a dual rain shower, inspiring decor, and even a zen garden. We definitely hope to stay here again during our next Seattle visit :)"
1095207,33472498,2015-05-28,3963554,Steve,"The place was very tidy and clean, it was perfect for the purposes of a business trip, there was three of us each with their own room and bathroom. The local bars in the area were very friendly and accommodating. "
20927,60796,2010-07-04,3884237,Ellery,"The cottage was great!  Brad and Liz are very friendly and welcoming - they made us feel right at home and their place is very comfortable.  It was in a great location in Ballard - you can walk to the cute part of town, to the Locks and also to the water. 

I would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
20927,63212,2010-07-10,39562,Peter,"Liz and Brad were wonderful hosts and very friendly and smart, I liked that about them. Brad and I connected quickly because of our science backgrounds and we could have talked science for days. 

The studio is very nice and having art around is indeed inspiring, the bathroom was quaint and nice and the bed ok for two. The garden was fun and I love the Ballard area this is a great find for airbnb folks. Downtown Ballard is a happening area with great places to eat like Bastille and I love being around anything fishing boat because I grew up in a fishing town. 

The neighborhood was so quiet and quaint I could not believe it, we left early on Sunday and did not get a chance to say goodbye to such nice and friendly folks. "
20927,71969,2010-08-01,152690,Jerome,"My husband and I stayed in Liz & Brad's cottage for our anniversary week-end.  It was the perfect place to relax in a beautiful little cottage surrounded by art and the gardens.  Liz and Brad were very helpful in suggesting great places for breakfast, dinner and entertainment.  All within walking distance.  We live in Kingston, across the water from Seattle and our time at their little cottage felt like we were in another world.  Lot's to do but a cozy place to come back to and relax.  I would recommend their cottage/studio as a home away from home but even better.  Darcy Herrett"
20927,77851,2010-08-13,19012,Tabitha,"The cottage was great! Their studio is amazing, and the bed was comfortable. Their garden was really beautiful and Liz & Brad are really nice -- we loved our stay. Thanks again! :)"
20927,88055,2010-08-31,200068,Shawn,We very much enjoyed our time at the cottage.  Perfect location and size - not to mention the wonderful art!
20927,93275,2010-09-08,207495,Penelope,"Very warm and welcoming and comfortable people and place, a great space to retreat to after a day of dashing about seeing friends and family and concerts and plays.  I fancied the garden style and loved the smell of tuberose as you walked up the path.  Imagined I would get further in Eric Metaxas' new biography of Dietrich Bonhoffer I purchased for the occasion but loved the quiet reading time I did manage. Bed is compfy, studio is spacious and attractive, Liz and Brad were gracious hosts, would stay there again in a heartbeat."
20927,94295,2010-09-10,174487,Jessica,"Our stay was great! We were in contact with Brad prior to our arrival to make sure everything was O.K. and he was extremely helpful. The cottage was amazing. I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else if we manage to visit again. After several days on the road, we were able to relax in such a beautiful and comfortable space. The Ballard area is fun and has a wide range of shops, restaurants, and cafes. Downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods are easily accessible by bus. Liz and Brad even had a little basket of information about the area - including a waterproof map and bus schedules - near the bed."
20927,99947,2010-09-18,232208,Nancy,Addison and I enjoyed meeting Brad and had a wonderful chat. We enjoyed the studio and missed not seeing the artist!
20927,103932,2010-09-24,208064,John,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at Liz & Brad's lovely cottage in Ballard, Washington. They could not have been nicer or more accomodating. The cottage was everything we had hoped for. We were surrounded by the art works, pictures and sculptures, of Liz that were in varying stages of completion. Liz is a talented artist as well as a mathemetics teacher.

The cottage was nicely decorated and was warm and cozy, even when it got a little cool outside while we slept. The futon was very comfortable.

We have no complaints and do not hesitate to recommend this place to others.

Thanks, Liz and Brad. You helped make our stay in the pacific northwest a memorable one."
20927,106131,2010-09-27,202384,Kathryn,"The cottage was a delightful sanctuary.  I was greeted with the scent of flower petals, lavender and a comfortable bed in a garden setting. After an extremely hectic day preparing for a family wedding I could return to the cottage for a shower, a cup of tea and some peace and quiet before returning to the next event.  The centralized Ballard location was great, I was able to walk or drive a short way to shopping, the Ballard locks for pre-wedding photos, and then to the wedding site at the Ballard community center.  Thank you Brad and Liz!"
20927,110054,2010-10-02,239766,Nat,We enjoyed our stay. Brad & Liz are friendly. We also love the cat!
20927,112398,2010-10-05,239609,Katherine,"The space is quite cozy and comfortable tucked away in the garden.  Weather permitting get takeout, a bottle of wine and relax under the arbor.  

Liz and Brad provided helpful insight into the Seattle culture--the stuff you don't get in guide books. They were extremely accessible while also giving us all the privacy we may have needed.   

The Ballard business district-within walking distance- offers plenty of food,shopping and entertainment choices.

I vote Liz&Brad as AirBnB's poster couple."
20927,119136,2010-10-14,248200,Linda,"The cottage is awesome and was much nicer than staying in a hotel room for a week.  There were hummingbirds outside in the morning and cat visits if wanted.  I would stay here again if I return to Seattle.

20927,122376,2010-10-19,217813,Carla,"I am a little relunctant to leave a positive review out of fear this lovely retreat will be discovered.
This is a private cottage set in a wonderful neighborhood of well cared for homes. The surroundings offer interesting architecture, pride in gardens, lots of birds, a community shoping area with character and a Farmer Market which is treat to the eye as much as the palate. It is a peaceful and quiet area of Seattle and Ballard is a great for walking. 

Liz and Rick are perfect - helpful but not intrusive.
They own two wonderful young cats.

We will be back."
20927,125751,2010-10-24,248194,Deva,Liz and Brad's place is great--cozy cottage in a beautiful garden.  It is very convenient to downtown Seattle via the bus and walkable to all of the great restaurants and bars in Ballard.  I would definitely recommend it.  
20927,135875,2010-11-08,278853,Calen & Dani,Liz & Brad's cottage is perfect for a weekend getaway. They are extremely hospitable and the cottage is wonderfully laid out. 
20927,141509,2010-11-19,206203,Amanda,"This is a sweet little cottage in a great neighborhood, close to lots of interesting shops and restaurants yet the cottage is quiet and peaceful.  Liz and Brad were very kind and generous and I would definitely stay there again."
20927,145038,2010-11-27,245918,David,"To gain perspective, I have waited to Rate and Review.

I think Brad and Liz would agree that the heating in the studio over Thanksgiving  was inadequate for the weather/temperature.  The wood burning stove was inoperable and the two electric radiators (turned up to the maximum) did not provide enough heat.  Luckily, we had brought a down comforter from home. It was so cold inside, we were unable to shower.   

Frankly, had I been the hosts, I would have notified my  guests  ahead of time about the heating conditions and not tell them about it when they arrived.

Had we known, we definitely would have made other arrangements.

20927,152384,2010-12-12,228312,Eric And Dana,"Great place and very walkable to a quaint retail shopping area. Brad recently improved the insulation, so we were comfortable despite how cold it was outside. "
20927,156646,2010-12-21,279347,Mary Ann,"Liz and Brad were delightful hosts.  Their Ballard Cottage is so comfortable and cozy, great for one or two guests.  My relatives nearby wanted to meet them but took sick over the holidays.  Perhaps next time.  Thanks for your warm hospitality.
"
20927,163151,2011-01-03,261612,Alisha,"Liz and Brad were fantastic! The studio was small, but cute and we were constantly inspired by Liz's art work. 

Ballard is a great neighborhood. It is quiet, yet located to so many great coffee shops and places to eat. We had a great time! "
20927,169491,2011-01-11,328913,Christine,"Thanks Brad and Liz - this was a wonderful ""home away from home"" for us while we were in Ballard.  It's a greaat  location in a quiet neighborhood, easy access to downtown Ballard, cozy and warm (even in January - and it will be cozier once the woodstove is fixed), beautiful art, and pleasant hosts.  What more could you ask for?  Well, maybe we could ask for all the flowers in the garden to be blooming, but then we'd have to stay until May...."
20927,172915,2011-01-21,206203,Amanda,My second stay with Brad and Liz and quite enjoyable.  The bed is very comfortable and they are great hosts.  
20927,179063,2011-02-07,38099,Ilya,"This was an absolutely delightful cottage, and I hope to be back! It was a peaceful oasis - and so warm and cozy in the winter. Very well equipped, too, with everything one might need. A great find!"
20927,199811,2011-03-15,170919,Nan,A lovely space to stay at while visiting Seattle.  We especiaaly liked the neighborhood of Ballard - the Sunday market and the number of good reataurants and being near the locks. And Brad and Liz were great hosts---we had good times talking  to them.
20927,212067,2011-03-29,393540,Ellen,Great place. My parents loved it!
20927,274826,2011-05-22,484200,Brian,"Stayed with Brad and Liz (and Jasper and Lily!) for almost 2 weeks in their cottage while attending a cooking workshop.  Great place to relax and unwind while staying in Seattle.  Central and easy to get anywhere by bus or walking.  Beautiful gardens surround the cozy cottage where you can sit outside and enjoy the sunshine.

I will definitely stay with Brad and Liz again in the future.  "
20927,289024,2011-05-30,618275,Dan,"Just a really lovely little cottage in a really nice part of town. A perfect way to visit Seattle and feel like a guest, not a tenant. Thanks, Brad and Liz!"
20927,302981,2011-06-07,628123,Daniel,"Liz and Brad's Ballard cottage really hit the sweet spot for me - quiet and peaceful leading to a great night's sleep, a perfect 10K distance from both Discovery and Golden Gardens Parks, friendly hosts but loads of privacy, plus two great cats and a really lovely garden.  Throw in back to back sunny days and wow what a great stay."
20927,343632,2011-06-30,488725,Cindy And Steve,"We really enjoyed the cottage...it was a peaceful, cozy, and creative space to spend the week.  We really enjoyed the visits by Jasper and Lily the cats!  It was convenient to the bus routes, the Ballard Locks, the Botanical Gardens and a great running/walking path along the water.  Thanks so much!"
20927,353361,2011-07-05,516671,Joyce,"I spent 3 nights and was happy as a clam. The cottage is cozy and art filled, and the gardens are lovely. The house is well situated...I was able to walk to wonderful bakeries, the farmer's market, and the locks. On my first morning, I thought I felt an ocean breeze of sorts and sure enough I did. Walking down the street, I was treated to a wonderful view of the water and mountains. Downtown Seattle was an easy 5-6 miles away.  "
20927,379348,2011-07-18,290500,Liz,"We loved being in such a calm, quiet neighborhood. It was also close to
several fun places to eat (breakfast, lunch and dinner)! 
We appreciated all the information about places to see, how to get around and the nice touches to make us feel very welcome!!!
Hope to come back again next year!  "
20927,411448,2011-08-01,769326,Matthew,"Great little cottage. My wife and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and couldn't have asked for better hosts. The cottage had everything we needed and bed was comfy as well. Location is great too, as it's within walking distance to a lot of things. Downtown is just a quick 15 minute drive away as well. We would definitely stay here again."
20927,512655,2011-09-08,521075,Clark,"Highly recommended little cottage with great hosts in a great neighborhood.  Brad and Liz were friendly and helpful with directions, suggestions of places to eat, and any requests we had.  Plus, there were cool cats for petting in the lovely garden.  The only issue we had was a somewhat flakey wi-fi connection, though Brad was super attentive in dealing with this.  We look forward to staying again next time."
20927,523889,2011-09-12,958813,Laura,"Brad & Liz were perfect hosts, and we couldn't have been happier with the ""home away from home"" we found in their Ballard cottage.  We enjoyed our walks through the neighborhood to nearby cafes and shops, and it was easy to hop a bus downtown.  The cottage is beautiful inside & out with all the artwork and surrounding gardens.  We had lovely weather during our visit and ran into Brad & Liz in the garden often, and really enjoyed chatting with them.  We highly recommend their Ballard cottage & hope we can stay with them again in the future."
20927,536257,2011-09-16,206203,Amanda,This is a comfortable cottage and I was happy to see and smell the beautiful garden as previous visits were in late fall. Brad amd Liz are friendly hosts. It is pretty quiet for the city and they provide a very comfortable bed and pillows. I highly recommend their Ballard cottage.
20927,568623,2011-09-26,943575,Patricia,The cottage is a lovely place that was extraordinarily convenient for me--an extra blessing. It had everything I needed including fascinating artwork to look at as it's Liz's studio. There was even a lovely kitty who visited with me when I sat on the patio in the morning. I was able to walk the maybe 4 blocks to a gardens and the locks and watch salmon swimming even. It was a great stay. 
20927,639138,2011-10-17,1263898,Suzanne,"It is a great place for respite  We were concerned the futon wouldn't fit my husband he is 6'3 but it was very comfortable for both of us.  We would certainly return when in town.  

 "
20927,662848,2011-10-25,1169627,Jennifer,"Cute, quiet cottage and fantastic location! The owners are friendly and the cottage is filled with beautiful paintings and sculptures! There are also some very friendly cats that come by now and again. Definitely not a hotel, cob webs here and there, but super convenient if you want to stay in Ballard! The futon was pretty good and we stayed for 4 nights. Clean sheets and towels, but the rest of the place could use a once over. Would give it 3.5 stars if that was an option on here. All in all, pretty good deal for the money and fantastic deal for the location!"
20927,695693,2011-11-06,1267518,Betty,Perfect spot. Host are so kind. Loved living surrounded by amazing art and a chance to be in a great part of Seattle.  Will return.
20927,703765,2011-11-08,699485,Sara,"We had a great time here. My boyfriend and I went to a wedding this weekend and were looking for a nice quiet and romantic place to stay that was outside of downtown. This place was perfect!

The room was clean, cosey, quiet and in a very great location. (only a ten min walking distance from downtown Ballard). I had some reserves about the futon and one of the previous reviews about it being like an icebox in the winter...But the futon was really a comfy bed and  there were two space heaters that heated the room just nicely. Liz and Brad were great and very accommodating. We'll be back again!"
20927,726369,2011-11-17,258677,Eric,"Brad and Liz's cottage provided me a perfect pied-a-terre for a week In one of Seattle's most lively neighborhoods. As other guests have noted, the bed is very comfortable and the environs are serenely quiet. It is wonderful to have your own space separate from the main house. You can come and go as you please without fear of disturbing anyone. Brad and Liz are close at hand if you need anything, but otherwise don't intrude. Downtown Ballard is a 5 to 10 minute walk away, with a wide assortment of shops and restaurants. There are frequent bus connections to downtown and the university district. The microwave, mini-fridge and electric kettle make it easy to fix your own breakfast before setting off in the morning. I found the 2 space heaters worked quite well in keeping the cottage warm and cozy in mid-November when the outside temperature was in the low to mid 40 degrees.
"
20927,734024,2011-11-21,1110427,Jeanine,This is a great little cottage. It's located right in the heart of Ballard and you can easily explore the neighborhood from its location. Brad and Lisa are friendly and accommodating - but also leave you to your privacy. It was very easy to check in and out and I would definitely stay there again.
20927,744560,2011-11-26,278618,Diana,"I only wish my stay had been longer. It's a lovely cottage in a charming setting: there's a grape arbor and garden, and you can hear distant ship's horns now and then. Having Liz's artwork and works-in-progress in the space made it feel like a real home, not just a rental unit. The cottage is nicely appointed; lots of luxurious warm comforters, and very good heating. 

Brad & Liz were warm and authentically welcoming hosts; I really felt they enjoy what they do, as hosts. 

I would definitely stay here again on another Seattle visit. "
20927,778332,2011-12-12,554916,Diane,"Brad and Liz were very welcoming and kind.  The studio is a really beautiful, amazing space.  I love Liz's paintings and sculpture., and the atmosphere in the studio is phenomenal.   UNfortunately, I have chemical sensitivities and had a reaction to the fabric softener they use in their laundry, which caused me to cut my visit short.  Most people would probably not have this issue at all, but anyone with chemical sensitivities might want to let the Severtson's know ahead of time, and be aware of this."
20927,857426,2012-01-11,713145,Chris,"Awesome little cottage!  It was perfect for my stay in Seattle.  Surrounded by great art, feng shway all the way!!  Super convenient to downtown.  All the privacy I could ever want and very friendly hosts who invited me in for dinner one night!"
20927,866981,2012-01-16,1600786,Kevin,"This was a very fortunate find. Ballard is a great neighborhood with tons of  restaurants, bars and coffee shops and the cottage is just a couple of minutes walking from the neighborhood center. The cottage itself is beautiful: complete a nice little kitchenette, interesting books, mini-fridge and anything else that you might need. The hosts were great too!"
20927,903795,2012-02-06,613623,Celes,Brad and Liz are wonderful hosts -- we loved our comfortable artist studio nestled into their pretty garden.  Great access to beautiful Ballard and all it has to offer!
20927,967571,2012-03-03,1822644,Carol,"The pluses are: very friendly and accomodating hosts, convenience to many Seattle satellite neighborhoods, very private, spacious, quaint, filled with art and comfortable futon bed.
The minuses: musty odor, strong dryer fragrance, cold tile floors that heat up slowly with free standing heaters, need for thorough cleaning and some basic upgrading. Cats are lovely but beware if you are allergic."
20927,1007950,2012-03-17,1646886,Ed,"Great place!

- Brad and Liz were great!
- The bed/futon was very comfortable
- The area, Ballard, is a lovely area that is a lot more relaxed than downtown (but not that far away)
- There is a great supermarket close, making eating a lot cheaper
- The space in general is pretty great, loadsa art everywhere, far more interesting than your average accommodation.
- Solid (but not amazingly fast) internet
- They have 2 lovely cats that love to keep you company!

I had a great stay in the cottage, highly recommended. "
20927,1053476,2012-03-27,1032649,Libby,"We came for a romantic couple of days and were well pleased. The cottage was private, charming, beautifully decorated with Liz's inspiring art. We brought our bikes since it is convenient to many scenic places, and the cats provided entertainment.  Brad was a dear to deal with. We feel very lucky and had a great time.  There was even a record player!"
20927,1059961,2012-03-29,2004901,Pamela,"My daughter and I had a terrific stay at Brad an Liz's backyard cottage.  The space was roomy and comfortable and extras such as teas and cups, cutlery, a small fridge and microwave were perfect for or needs.  We asked Brad for dining suggestions and his recommendations were the best!"
20927,1085009,2012-04-05,237512,Echo,"The cabin is so lovely and cozy! The futon was very comfortable, and the heat was adjustable and warm. The garden is so cute, and Brad was a lovely host.  We look forward to returning often!"
20927,1179111,2012-04-25,2049764,Heather,"My husband and I loved staying in this wonderful cottage.  The location was perfect, Brad and Liz are amazing hosts, and the cottage was a great space for us.  The garden/patio area is perfect for soaking up the sun, enjoying the wonderful flowers, and unwinding from the day.  Thanks for sharing your cottage with us and we plan on returning!"
20927,1226988,2012-05-04,60846,Andrew,"Brad and Liz are amazing hosts: courteous, kind, knowledgable, and friendly. Brad reached out nearly a week before our stay and was a constant source of advice throughout. I'm glad I trusted his bar/drink suggestions.

The pictures on the listing page don't do the cottage justice. It's simply the coziest 300-400 square feet imaginable. It might look small - like a shared space - but it's not. It's absolutely plenty of space for one or two people who need a home base from which to explore Ballard.

My biggest gripe about my stay would have to be the wireless internet. Unavailable the first evening, it was spotty every night thereafter. This wasn't something that Brad/Liz knew about before our arrival, and it wasn't something that was ""fixed"" by the end of our stay.

In lieu of a reliable connection, Brad let us work from within his house - where Brad made us coffee and let us borrow a handful of movies. It was a very reasonable alternative to constant access. Still, as someone who works from his laptop, I admit that I didn't get as much done in the evenings as I would have liked.

All that said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to friends and stay there again once the wireless is back in action!"
20927,1251691,2012-05-09,1316485,Joe,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Brad and Liz's cottage for 4 nights and we LOVED it!  The space was quaint, clean, comfortable and private.  Brad and Liz were easy to communicate with, incredibly kind, and offered great suggestions for things to do in the Ballard area (downtown and 'old' Ballard are only blocks away!).

We definitely plan on staying at Brad and Liz's cottage again during our next trip to Seattle."
20927,1271521,2012-05-13,237512,Echo,"The cottage is our choice every time we visit Seattle, and will recommend it to friends and family! Thank you Brad and Liz for providing such a lovely retreat!"
20927,1296813,2012-05-17,2351412,Melanie,"I stayed with Brad and Liz when I was visiting Seattle for a couple of days with my boyfriend.  The cottage was wonderful.  We had everything we needed, and the neighborhood was fantastic.  Brad and Liz gave us some great tips about the area, and their basket of maps was very helpful for finding our way around the city.  Also, the sweet cats were a big plus.  It was a great stay."
20927,1507922,2012-06-18,2478327,Rita,"We stayed at the Cottage in Ballard for the Solstice Parade in Freemont last weekend and had a great time!  Brad & Liz are wonderful hosts, which we believe is paramount! (Not that the futon wasn't extremely comfortable, with satiny cotton sheets and plenty of towels etc.,)  We had a dilemma with our car window not closing, and Brad immediately went to his workshop for duct tape and plastic! Ballard is a fabulous community to stroll through, with plenty of great restaurants and shops. The farmers market is also interesting. It was fun staying in a residential neighbourhood, in a charming heritage style home/artist' cottage, and meeting Brad and Liz.   "
20927,1585099,2012-06-28,332537,Mike,A great little studio cottage - set beautifully on a quiet street beside a home that is very obviously a labor of love. Brad and Liz were helpful and accommodating. We'll be back soon. 
20927,1620837,2012-07-03,561316,Nellie,"Brad & Liz's garden cottage was lovely! My husband and I were surrounded by inspiring art, lush gardens, and friendly cats. Brad and Liz are gracious hosts and we had a great time chatting about the city and their fascinating projects. Also, Ballard is a rad place to stay! "
20927,1641912,2012-07-06,846139,Bryan,"We really enjoyed staying here.  The place was charming and comfortable, and Brad and Liz were great hosts.  Be sure to ask them to recommend restaurants!"
20927,1666518,2012-07-09,1423994,Kristen,"Highlights were our kind hosts, a tidy and inspiring cottage, and a vibrant community. The bed is comfy, the space is charming with all of Liz's sculptures and paintings, and Brad had plenty of neighborhood suggestions for us to enjoy. "
20927,1754211,2012-07-20,2622104,Gary,Cottage was exactly as it appears in the listing.  Very comfortable.  Brad and Liz were excellent hosts.
20927,1766367,2012-07-21,969238,Alison,The reservation was canceled 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20927,1798350,2012-07-25,2759725,Rachel,"We loved the cottage and the Ballard neighborhood! The cottage had everything we needed without being fussy. It truly felt like home away from home. The futon is surprisingly comfortable, Liz's art and gardens are inspiring, and the cats are friendly. It's an easy walk to Ballard's main drag, which had plenty of restaurants, pubs, and shops to keep us busy for a week, and a short drive to other neighborhoods, including downtown Seattle.  We'll definitely stay here again when we're back in Seattle!"
20927,1814669,2012-07-27,2917567,John,"I can't imagine a better place to stay in the Seattle area!  The Ballard District has become a center of superb food and drink, with a number of great choices ranging from a French cafe, funky bars and fine dining.  Several convenient options for mass transit make other parts of the city easily accessible.  But, most importantly, Brad and Liz are the perfect hosts; they made me feel immediately welcomed.  The accommodations--the Cottage--is a very comfortable space, surrounded by an amazing garden.  On a more practical note: it could not be more reasonably priced--an incredible value!"
20927,1878435,2012-08-03,2948635,Jessica,"The cottage is great, and Brad and Liz were lovely! We loved staying there, surrounded by Liz's art. It was very comfy - we only wished we had more time to just enjoy the cottage and the beautiful gardens! We enjoyed downtown Ballard and the locks as well. It's a really neat part of the city. We would definitely go back (and stay here)."
20927,1982891,2012-08-14,148353,Rob,"This was probably my best AirBNB experience yet. Brad and Liz were great hosts who made me feel at home from the minute I arrived, and the cottage is a truly beautiful space. Despite being 5 minutes from downtown Ballard, it feels as remote and private as one could ask for. 

Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle. I recommend the cottage for anyone else visiting the city who wants a unique and relaxing experience. "
20927,2031814,2012-08-19,728807,Elizabeth,"A lovely property; a very comfortable space. Brad and Liz are welcoming, kind, lively hosts (who look ten years younger than their photo). Very much enjoyed exploring Ballard Ave. Easy trip from the airport, or back downtown to museums, ferries etc. It was great having a peaceful place to return to at the end of the day."
20927,2076910,2012-08-23,3030385,Mackenzie,"Brad and Liz were the perfect host. Very approachable, giving, and quite helpful. The cottage is absolutely lovely, and the garden was probably one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Also the cottage is in a prime location, very close to downtown Ballard, and to bus stations that can take you anywhere your heart could desire. Loved, loved, loved it, and would highly recommend if you are coming to Seattle to stay with these guys. Couldn't have asked for anything more, thank you!! "
20927,2193035,2012-09-04,1765670,Melody,"The cottage was absolutely charming and perfectly situated for our visit with our son who lives in Ballard. We were able to walk to the Lake Washington locks, several wonderful coffee cafes, our son's apartment and Ballard's Farmers' Market on Sunday, among other things!
Brad and Liz were wonderful...responded quickly to emails and texts and met us at the cottage when we arrived to show us around.  In fact if there was any disappointment, it was that because we were so busy with our son, we didn't get to see and get acquainted with Liz and Brad as much as we'd have liked :0)
We'll definitely stay there again the next time we visit!
"
20927,2224798,2012-09-07,1531672,Leslie,"I had an incredibly peaceful time at Brad & Liz's lovely cottage.  It was absolutely comfortable, easy, private, clean and with the great vibe of all of Liz's art.  Really great place...they were fantastic although we didn't see much of each other but everything felt so easy and mellow.  Thank you both and I will absolutely see you again!  Hi to my little friend, Jasper who greeted me nightly upon my arrival!  "
20927,2360406,2012-09-21,3125596,Sarah,"Absolutely loved my stay at the cottage! Liz and Brad are delightful, and I can't wait to see them again the next time I'm in Seattle! :)"
20927,2473514,2012-10-01,3578470,Hannah,"This place is wonderful-just as it was listed and just as the photos show.  There is a superlatively friendly cat that came calling a few times, the garden is lovely and Brad and Liz extremely nice.  Perfect!"
20927,2562001,2012-10-09,946885,Aditya,"Everything we hoped for. Nice, clean private space in a great neighborhood. Brad & Liz were super-nice, friendly and respectful. Would definitely recommend and stay again. "
20927,2642161,2012-10-17,3603006,Ellis,I had a wonderful stay!  Great location!
20927,2742178,2012-10-28,1945241,Christopher Sean,"An easy place to hunker down in to during a rainy Seattle stay, this little bungalow is simply a sweet spot! Brad and Liz both offered engaging conversation. Very accomplished folks and impressively creative with their hobbies and home, I shall definitely look to book here again. Nearby places to eat like the Portage Bay cafe topped my time in Seattle with tasty indulgence and then a nice little walk to the Locks complemented my start on the day. Highly recommended!"
20927,2786579,2012-11-02,3794337,Leena,"This was the perfect spot for me
I love Ballard and the guesthouse is cozy and comfy and filled with Liz's beautiful artwork
it was like staying with friends
They are both charming, warm, available and fantastic hosts

Next time Im coming withou the rain to enjoy sitting in the gardens!"
20927,2802112,2012-11-04,1126217,Randy,"We stayed with Brad and Liz for two nights Nov 1&2, and we could not have been happier!  The cottage is Liz' studio, a separate building in back of their home; it's really wonderful, full of her clay sculptures and various assorted works of art.  Nice comfy bed, coffee maker, micro and little fridge; all the comforts of home.  The location is ideal, on a super quiet residential street in Ballard neighborhood, about 45 blocks north of downtown, and a few blocks from great restaurants, shopping, Crittenden Locks and Shilshole Bay and it's marina.  Because it's a separate living area, we only met Brad for a few minutes when we arrived, but he was pleasant and helpful.  Highly recommend this place; we hope to stay with them on our next trip up to Seattle."
20927,2855787,2012-11-11,3718190,Sara,Charming cottage in a great location!  Would stay here again! 
20927,2916176,2012-11-19,2955512,David,We had a fine stay in the cottage.  It was clean and cozy. Brad and Liz have created a fine space for guests.  The cottage is conveniently located for exploring Ballard. Easity accessible to the rest of Seattle. We particularly enjoyed morning walks to nearby Discovery Park.  I would recommend the cottage to interested travelers.
20927,2938328,2012-11-21,4121120,Amy,"Super cute and perfect location.   Completely ""as advertised"".  Brad made it all super easy.  Would stay here again!    "
20927,2965704,2012-11-26,2645601,Robin,"My son and grandson stayed at the cottage over Thanksgiving holidays, while I stayed with my daughter who lives 3 blocks away.  All of us felt the cottage was perfect for what we needed- a good, clean space to stay but had the big plus of the ambiance of Ballard!  It was cozy and nice.  "
20927,2993071,2012-11-29,2167142,Sandra,"This was the perfect place for me to stay.  I took the bus into Seattle, then the ferry to Bainbridge Island and spent most of the day.  What a lovely trip on a sunny winter day.  My host's restaurant recommendation worked perfectly after an afternoon at the Chihuly Glass Museum.  Seattle is just really cool, lots to do, and beautiful to look at.  I hope to go back frequently, and enjoy the cottage often."
20927,3014541,2012-12-03,3988419,Stefanie,"Staying at Brad and Liz's cottage was a pleasure. The location was great, Brad and Liz were very helpful and friendly. The space was clean and quiet with a comfy bed and clean towels... all we needed for our weekend away. We would definitely stay again if we make another stop to Ballard."
20927,3143412,2012-12-23,3637579,Tim,"Just as advertised, cozy studio.  Great location, walking distance to Ballard's restaurants, quiet neighborhood.  Would stay here again without hesitation. "
20927,3378023,2013-01-20,4577913,Jacqueline,"I really loved the art studio cottage.  The bed was so comfortable, I slept like a baby!  8 or 9 hours each nite - for 8 nites!  The weather was cold, so I was under the blankets, snuggled into the pillows.  
The art, so beautiful, was really a special feature.  The cottage is the right size for 1 or 2 people.
It was where I wanted to be, close to Ballard to walk to dinner, take in the downtown.
I'd love to come back in spring/summer to see the gardens.  Brad and Liz, great hosts, there when you need them, but lots of privacy.  Thank you!"
20927,3393317,2013-01-22,4456655,Lisa,"Such a great space!  Comfy, relaxing and cute!  Brad and Liz were great hosts leaving us with such nice amenities as big fluffy towels, great coffee and tea, refrigerator for our local baked bread, and Jasper, the most friendliest of cats.  Loved Ballard, what a great area too with small shops, local bakeries, bars and restaurants.  Don't forget the Sunday Ballard market!
Thanks!"
20927,3462950,2013-02-03,2995234,Constance,"Nonpareil. I have never rested so comfortably away from home. The bed was a dreamscape, and I appreciated the excellent reading lamp that allowed me to sink into slumber beneath the shade of a good book. From the bedstead to the kitchenette to the bathroom, there was a broad and anticipatory array of amenities, but even without the blackberry sage tea and electric kettle (to boot), the place was a sanctuary of the highest order to which I nightly looked forward to retiring. The furniture, the artwork, the books, and the pillows created a calm and regenerative atmosphere which alone was worth the trip to Seattle---never mind that I had come to work!. That it was in the heart of Ballard (Seattle's Lilttle Scandinavia) still has me swooning.
Moreover, my hosts were warm and welcoming, and I look forward to visiting with them again one day."
20927,3490586,2013-02-06,4923170,Douglas,Very pleasant small cottage with privacy and responsive hosts.
20927,3518785,2013-02-11,215230,Carol,"A unique and refreshing stay- I did a mini writer's retreat in their nicely crafted cottage art studio in Ballard. Surrounded by sculptures and work in progress, this was just the place for tuning in with my Muse. Nearby cafes and the Golden Garden Beach were nice walking breaks too. Their two curious cats added an amusing note. "
20927,3593171,2013-02-20,3603006,Ellis,Thanks again Brad & Liz!!   I had a wonderful stay at your Cottage!!  
20927,3681091,2013-03-03,1386968,Heidi,"As all the other reviewers have said, this spot is just perfect. It has to be the best AirBnB deal in Seattle. We stayed two nights on a mix of work and play, and this was a great spot for both. Everything in the cottage is just as advertised (or better). It was comfortable and cozy, and Brad and Liz were very welcoming, as were their friendly cats. Plus, Ballard is a great area to explore and not a far drive from other good spots in the city. "
20927,3700338,2013-03-05,4956229,Kris,"Beautiful little cottage, so cozy and perfect!
The art is absolutely amazing and wonderful to enjoy while you are there and almost gives you the feel of being in Paris and how you would imagine an artists studio to be. Lovely!
And the kitties make great hosts and are always willing to cuddle with you.
I had a relaxing, comfortable vacation! Thank you Brad & Liz. :)

Kris. "
20927,3749954,2013-03-11,362016,Nancy,"Wonderful spot. Quiet, comfy, cozy Great bed. Slept well. Walking distance from great food spots. Highly recommend. "

20927,3854776,2013-03-21,3459761,Robert,"The cottage was beautiful, a working artist studio and retreat, very quiet, and a nice place to stay. Flexible time arrangements, very easy. Would rebook another time and looking forward to get to know Brad and Liz a little bit. Street parking was easy and plentiful. "
20927,3920825,2013-03-27,5353710,Berit,A great little place in my favorite location in Seattle.
20927,4066608,2013-04-07,2037096,Jonathan,"A splendid little Ballard gem.  I'm from the Seattle area and just wanted to give a visiting friend a taste of what the different neighborhoods have to offer.  Brad and Liz's place was a great choice for Ballard: they were great hosts, totally relaxed and knowledgeable; the location was fantastic; and the cottage itself was so comfy - even (or especially) on a rainy April weekend."
20927,4116829,2013-04-11,5209220,Jennifer,Had a brief but lovely stay at this wonderful little cottage. Brad and Liz were kind and welcoming. The cottage was filled with the wonderful creations of Liz and it was a very comfortable space. The futon was quite comfortable and we were plenty warn despite the cool spring weather. Good walking distance to nice shops and restaurants. I would certainly recommend this little cottage.
20927,4290254,2013-04-25,5084531,Lindsey,"Perfect option for staying in Ballard. Easy walk everywhere, accommodations were very clean, and the neighborhood very safe. Hosts were super mellow, only saw Brad once but he kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed. Southwest lost our luggage and didn't get it to us for a day and half. Brad offered us warm clothes since we had only light jackets after flying in from Florida. Very kind folks. Overall great stay, would and most likely will stay again."
20927,4338604,2013-04-29,232493,Margo,"What a wonderful stay Eddy and I had in Seattle.  By good fortune, we ended up in the Ballard district, the heart of  the downtown with brick roads and repurposed beautiful buildings from the 19th C within walking distance from the cottage.  A great farmer's market on Sunday, so many restaurants and coffee shops,  Ballard is perhaps our favorite district in Seattle.  The cottage was hard to say ""good bye"" to, colorful, cozy, comfortable, well-located. Brad and Liz are super hosts, friendly and helpful.  We highly recommend a stay with Brad and Liz.  "
20927,4417675,2013-05-04,5593203,Christine,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay in Brad and Liz's cottage very much.  The furnishings are very comfortable and the art is truly incredible and inspiring.  Since we visited during an early May heat wave, we also appreciated being able to sit outside in the lush spring garden.  Cats Jasper and Lilly made us feel right at home too!  We highly recommend the Salmon Bay Cafe for breakfast....you won't need to eat again until dinner.  "
20927,4446432,2013-05-06,1898711,Inga & Jennifer,Wonderful hosts! Perfect cozy space and area of town! The art all around us was an added bonus. Loved getting to know Liz & Brad and would definitely stay again!
20927,4634875,2013-05-17,5401518,Diane,"I stayed eight days this month ( May) in Liz and Brad's cottage and had a wonderful time. This cottage is charming! It's situated in a sweet-smelling, beautiful garden that was, happily, in bloom during my stay, on a lovely Ballard Street. An easy walk to downtown Ballard and very close to the locks. The cottage has been thoughtfully appointed--I had everything I needed and more. It's also lovely to stay in the midst of Liz's artwork, which gives the cottage a unique, personal feel. I'll definitely stay here again."
20927,4857496,2013-05-29,2432171,Sharon,"We had a lovely stay here! I appreciated the privacy and cozy atmosphere of the cottage, and having visits from Jasper (the cat) added to the homey feel. Brad and Liz provided great information about the neighborhood, and Ballard is totally delightful! Would happily stay here again when I return to Seattle!"
20927,4908674,2013-06-01,3060823,Renate,"Thanks Brad and Liz - we enjoyed our stay in your secluded, cozy garden escape (aka studio). It was the perfect base from which to explore Ballard and Seattle."
20927,4969542,2013-06-04,6318258,Donata,"On our trip down the American west coast we were lucky enough to start off at a really special place - Liz's and Brad's garden was just as magical as expected, we were blessed with beautiful weather and we liked Ballard actually more than downtown Seattle! We loved being there, a romantic and peaceful to charge your batteries after the big city buzz, which is pretty much right around the corner! (great to explore the open mic's and music scene of Seattle...) Brad and Liz were great hosts and helped us out as much as they could, it felt more like staying with friends than actually being hosted by complete strangers ;-) "
20927,5113500,2013-06-13,623307,Caryn,"Brad and Liz were super cool, nice, and accommodating.  Great, private, and interesting space.  Would stay again!"
20927,5140303,2013-06-15,5035412,Paula,"Wonderful little artist cottage!!!!!!  Close to everything: restaurants, stores, downtown Seattle and water front. We enjoyed our stay very much. Brad was great to answer any questions we had about the area and make suggestions as to places to eat."
20927,7066174,2013-09-05,6683826,Mathias,"Brad & Liz sind hervorragende Gastgeber, warmherzig, freundlich und hilfsbereit. So hatten wir einen schönen Start in unseren Nordwest-Urlaub. Wir verbrachten 2 Nächte im sehr interessanten Cottage mit  den tollen Skulpturen und Bildern von Liz. Das Cottage liegt in Ballard in einer ruhigen Wohngegend und doch ist das Stadtzentrum mit dem Auto schnell zu erreichen.
Vielen Dank Liz und Brad für die schöne Zeit."
20927,7227708,2013-09-11,8426794,Sharon,"What a wonderful little cottage. This was our first use of air b&b and it gave us a great impression. Brad and Liz were very pleasant, and gave helpful recommendations about places to eat in the area. We wish we got to spend more time talking with them but we were too busy exploring Seattle! Location is great and the cottage is cozy and comfortable. Would suggest this place to all friends passing through Seattle. Thanks brad and Liz!!"
20927,7245703,2013-09-13,3739917,Lily,"My husband and I stayed in Brad and Liz's artists cottage for two nights, and it was great! The cottage is charming and we had everything we needed. It was fun to explore Ballard, and the neighborhood was great for running, with a path by the water just a few blocks away. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Walrus and the Carpenter as well! "
20927,7309434,2013-09-15,3375611,Henrike,"Brad and Liz´s cottage is truly a special place and Ballard a great neighborhood on top. We can highly recommend it to everyone! In addition, Cafe Besola (French patisserie), which is in walking distance, offers definitely the best Latte and Quiche in town.   "
20927,7396921,2013-09-18,6662076,Doron,"We had a lovely time at brad and Liz's cottage. The bed was super comfy, everything was spotlessly clean, and all the art gives the place immense personality and charm. And Ballard is awesome! The Sunday farmers market was great fun, and we had some wonderful meals in the neighborhood. "
20927,7472365,2013-09-21,8835084,Alice,"We had a great time! Very quaint, comfortable studio in the heart of Ballard with easy access to public transportation and highway.  Liz and her daughter were excellent hosts. Highly recommended!!"
20927,7546558,2013-09-24,6539145,Renee,"The Cottage in the heart of Ballard was a wonderful place to stay. Brad and Liz (and daughter Rachael) were very conscientious about being easily reachable. The cottage was cozy and covered in beautiful artwork, the bed was comfy, and everything was clean. The stay was perfect."
20927,7628389,2013-09-27,8612777,Tim,"Brad and Liz were very helpful and prompt at communicating,  We reserved their cottage for our friends who were visiting from outside America, and they felt very well taken care of by their hosts.  The cottage is located behind the main house, with plenty of privacy and very quiet.  Our friends reported that they were very happy with the accommodations, and thoroughly enjoyed their stay!"
20927,8003864,2013-10-12,8850352,Seth,"Where to begin! This was the most perfect little cottage getaway. Brad came out to greet us upon arrival and was very helpful with eating recommendations as well as things to do and see in the Ballard area. The cottage itself was immaculate, with Liz's gorgeous art sprinkled throughout. Such great vibes! We had sweet kitty visitors, and the neighborhood was lovely to walk around within. We were sad to leave and wish our stay could've been longer. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfy, relaxing stay in Seattle. "
20927,8044073,2013-10-14,6549369,Megan,"Our stay at Brad and Liz's cottage was perfect. It was clean, warm, comfortable, and they have water, tea and a small fridge which were all very much appreciated. The artwork and sculptures in the cottage were outstanding. 

Unfortunately we never had the chance to meet Brad or Liz. We were there for a baptism so our days were long and full. I look forward to staying with them again sometime!"
20927,8118888,2013-10-16,8978382,Ashley,"What a great place in a perfect location! As a Seattle native I knew that Ballard is a wonderful place to stay. The cottage is in the perfect location, you can walk to so many great restaurants/bars/parks, etc. Liz and Brad were amazing hosts, as were their two kitties. Definitely recommend this cottage to anyone exploring the Seattle area!

20927,8520437,2013-11-04,8618034,Mary,"This was the first time that we used Airbnb and had a wonderful stay in Brad and Liz's cottage.  It's very comfortable, quiet, convenient  and great hosts!  It was everything we had desired!  We hope to stay here again whenever we are able to get back to Seattle!"
20927,8659105,2013-11-11,9233965,Shannon,"The Cottage is adorable and was just the right size for the two of us.  We had the opportunity to meet both Brad and Liz and found them to be very welcoming and friendly.  The parking is on the street, but we never had any issues finding a spot right by the house.  I would highly recommend this location to any other prospective airbnbers out there.  "
20927,8717611,2013-11-13,7610269,Leann,"Our stay at this cottage/studio in Ballard couldn't have been better. The accommodations were very comfortable, we were surrounded by beautiful paintings and sculptures (the guest room doubles as a studio), and our hosts had superb eating and drinking recommendations in the area. I strongly recommend staying here."

20927,9266546,2013-12-17,3365079,Eduardo,"Stayed for a weekend with my girlfriend and we had a great time at the cottage. Only got to meet Brad once but he seemed really great and his friend who checked us in was very amicable as well. The bed was really comfortable and the actual cottage itself was warm and cozy. The neighborhood was amazing and easily one of the quietest places I've ever visited. Everything was within walking distance. Wifi signal was a little weak but we really didn't have much use for it either way. Overall, an amazing stay."
20927,9775495,2014-01-09,10570613,Lindsie,Our first trip to Seattle was beautiful thanks to these two hosts! Warmth and hospitality is what we were greeted with and shown our entire stay!

They're in a cool part of Ballard next to stuff, the place is clean and decorated with Liz art, he welcomed us and gave a run-down of the town. We were free to come and go as we pleased after that. Very comfortable stay, would bunk here again in a minute.

Thanks Brad & Liz!"
20927,9996476,2014-01-24,723733,Sara,"I loved staying in the Cottage. It was super cute, very comfortable, and wonderfully quiet. Brad and Liz were communicative and amenable, but the Cottage has a lot of privacy. "

20927,10492198,2014-02-22,155275,Kim,"This place is as described, privacy, great location, good plumbing, and a host who responds quickly to text. We found the mattress comfortable and the pillows are many and very comfortable. If you book here, read the instructions given sent to you in the confirmation e-mail...it will tell you where the light switches are (the second room is not easy to find on your own). The location is excellent and within 3 blocks of bus service. We rented bicycles for our stay. The trails are close and convenient for city cycling (cars yield to bicycles and pedestrians). Liz and Brad were out of town for our trip so their daughter Rachael was our gracious host. We absolutely would stay here again."
20927,10551614,2014-02-24,6647417,Kris,"I had a great stay at Brad and 
Liz's cottage. Private and very  comfortable and perfect location for me.  I love the Ballard area and it is very close to friends and family. Unfortunately Brad and 
Liz were on vacation so I did not get to see them.  I actually know Brad from high school and would love to meet Liz who based on the work in the cottage a very talented artist. On street parking could not have been easier, would love to stay here again,
"
20927,10589615,2014-02-26,214189,Elisabeth,"We had a very comfortable and snug two days at Brad's and Liz's studio in Ballard. I loved the location - convenient to everything, but so quiet. The garden patio is inviting, wish it had been spring, not winter and rainy!  It will be so pretty then.  Didn't get to meet Liz and only said  ""Hello"" to Brad as he was riding off to work on his bike!  Maybe next time we can connect.  The family cats are friendly and fun.  And we did get to meet Rachael, their sweet college-aged daughter.  She was very helpful and available."
20927,10668046,2014-03-02,12368503,Anne,This little spot was perfect! Great cozy cottage and perfect location. Brad and Liz provide you with all the things you need to make ones stay charming. AND You can walk any to the best bakery in Seattle!

The cottage is the perfect distance to and from the heart of Ballard. If you are looking to escape and have a quiet retreat, then this place is for you. If you are looking to immerse yourself in Ballard's myriad restaurants and bars, then this place is for you. The commute is quick and safe. I would definitely come stay here again."
20927,10968719,2014-03-15,12871053,Mark,"Hell, yeah! Beautiful house, gorgeous residential neighborhood a couple miles from downtown, an easy jog to the water (I took a jog). My 2d day, hosts invited me in for an evening cocktail -- a sage martini, with gin and crushed sage and vermouth. No joke. This was my first AirBnB experience, and it makes me think that this is a great way to go."
20927,11141487,2014-03-22,2734499,Jason,Fantastic location. Lovely space filled with beautiful art. Delightful hosts. I was in Seattle on business and the space to care of all my needs.

I really enjoying waking up to Liz's sculptures every day and Brad was always forthcoming with suggestions about the neighbourhood, which we loved. I would definitely stay here again. "
20927,11401911,2014-04-01,12298536,J,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the artist's cottage.  It was comfortable, cozy, and we enjoyed being surrounded by art.  The friendly cats in the yard were always there to greet us and to say goodbye.  We also enjoyed eating at several restaurants in walking distance.  Would love to come back when it is not raining to enjoy the lovely yard too."

20927,12547364,2014-05-05,13425781,Travis,This beautiful cottage was exactly what my girlfriend and I needed! It is cozy yet spacious with a comfortable bed and great art work covering the walls. The surrounding garden and patio looked great as well but we didn't get a chance to use it due to the rain. Brad was very friendly and more than helpful telling us about some things to check out in Seattle during our visit. I would recommend the cottage to anyone and hope to go back soon!  Thanks Brad & Liz!
20927,12746533,2014-05-10,13325091,Elwin,"Fabulous space - we loved staying in their detached gate house in the lush back garden and being surrounded by Liz's drawings and sculptures. Beautiful earth tones. Great location away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Very convenient for transit riders. Too many great eateries for one neighbourhood.

Highly recommended. The cats are just as friendly as Brad and Liz.  "
20927,12905102,2014-05-13,14344220,Susan,"First time with Airbnb, and it was perfect! Brad and Liz's Cottage was a really charming place that made our stay in Ballard all the more special. Liz is an AMAZING artist, and waking up each morning in a supremely comfortable bed, surrounded by all that artistic creativity, was truly inspiring. The bed was roomy and comfortable, the amenities (microwave, French press, small fridge, cute bathroom) were convenient, and the surrounding neighborhood was easy to walk to. 
Ballard has MANY wonderful little restaurants and shops all within a 10-minute walk from this location. Very peaceful neighborhood with cool vibe. Bonus: we had a chance to chat briefly with Brad & Liz throughout our stay, and they are very warm and welcoming.  We are looking forward to staying here again when we next visit Seattle. HIGHLY recommended!"
20927,13006187,2014-05-17,800790,Jon & Laura,"Brad was a very welcoming and friendly host, and he made us feel right at home. We arrived a little early, and the Cottage was just being cleaned, but Brad welcomed us in and let us relax at the table in the garden patio while he finished prepping the Cottage. The Cottage itself was just as listed, and was very comfortable and a perfect size for two people. The bed was a futon, but as the listing states, it is as comfortable as a real bed.

The location is great. It is a short walk to NW Ballard, where there are dozens of fun bars and restaurants to enjoy. Brad gave us some recommendations, and each one we tried was fantastic. "
20927,13135091,2014-05-20,12903580,Kathy,"Art, flowers, privacy, quiet. Easy walking distance to restaurants and shops, the locks and botanic garden. Put them together and you have a lovely little retreat."
20927,13529314,2014-05-30,10041911,Howard,"The location is great: all the neighborhood homes are beautiful and well cared for. Short walk to restaurants and bus stops.Brad was very helpful giving us lots of local info. ; unfortunately we never met Liz, although shared her wonderful artistic accomplishments. Studio was not plush, but adequate."
20927,13877634,2014-06-07,14054183,Mark,"Brad and Liz were wonderful people,had a great stay just around the corner from my daughters house.Quite and clean cottage Liz's flowers were in bloom. Neighborhood very nice,shop's a short walk. Thanks Brad and Liz "
20927,14009790,2014-06-10,8678665,Matthew,"Brad & Liz were amazing hosts, and the cottage was absolutely perfect for us. We stayed for three nights and used it as a base of operations while we got married down at The Canal. The cottage was comfortable, which helped us relax the night before the wedding, and had all the amenities we could ask for. The cottage had plenty of space, so on the Big Day, there was plenty of space to get a bride, five bridesmaids, and a few other people ready simultaneously. Finally, there was plenty of privacy, which was very important for us as well. 

At the same time, Brad & Liz were always nearby if we needed anything. They even let us take some pre-wedding photos in their gorgeous garden! Overall a first-rate Airbnb experience, we could not recommend them more highly."
20927,14185511,2014-06-14,9688282,Michael,"Brad and Liz were incredibly hospitable and friendly.  They were pretty much the perfect hosts, welcoming us generously with tips and pointers about the area and visiting with us while we sat out on the patio enjoying a beer in the sunshine, but they also left us the space to quietly enjoy the privacy of their lovely, tranquil retreat from the city.  The sweet little back cottage set among the flowers and vines of the beautiful garden behind the main house was comfortable, filled with Liz's sculptures and paintings, and convenient to the Ballard neighborhood, which we really enjoyed exploring.  We'd definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!"
20927,14265725,2014-06-16,230140,Marie,"Brad & Liz have a unique space that offers a cozy respite with inspiring and relaxing touches. Their garden is wonderful in it's spring blooms!  The neighborhood feels safe and is super close to all amenities. We enjoyed our stay and recommend it to all who desire to travel off the beaten path, and have a taste for creative exploration.  It was chilly weather when we stayed but with the heaters they provide the little cottage heats up quickly."
20927,14431731,2014-06-19,14418525,Stan,"The neighborhood was very well cared for and Brad and Liz were very nice.  The fouton bed with no box springs or mattress was definitely not for any one over 40.
It was a stretch calling it a ""queen bed"".  Coffee and an electric pot took care of breakfast.  Fortunately there was a great coffee shop six block away and the
weather was great.  The shower was excruciatingly small.  Definitely not for the feint of heart."
20927,14549960,2014-06-22,12337783,Laura And Matthew,We enjoyed our stay in Ballard.  Brad and Liz were fantastic hosts.  The cottage had all the amenities and the property was beautiful.  We were able to walk to a couple of different bus stops so we could get around Seattle.

20927,19922660,2014-09-21,15481620,Ashley,Price is great for the place. Loved the house and all of the art. The garden area surrounding it is beautiful and peaceful. Brad and Liz are fabulous hosts and will make you feel right at home! It's also not too far of a walk to downtown Ballard or to bus stops to get to downtown Seattle.

20927,21133530,2014-10-12,10322884,Mark & Liz,"A restful, art-filled oasis near to coffee shops, restaurants and vintage shopping of Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. We could even walk to most of the 'hoods craft brew pubs, an extra bonus. We loved our stay, Brad and Liz were so hospitable and accommodating and we'll likely stay at the Cottage on our next trip to Seattle. Thank you so much! Mark & Liz"

20927,21621172,2014-10-20,6153249,Christeene Fraser,"I stayed here for a quick weekend trip, and could not be more pleased. Brad and Liz have created a lovely respite in the middle of the city - an art and light-filled little retreat in the middle of one of Seattle's best neighbors. It's within comfortable walking distance to the Chittenden Locks, Fremont, and dozens of fabulous restaurants. Also - quite easily accessed by public transportation.

Liz was a gracious hostess who assisted me with directions from Sea-Tac and recommendations for the best bakery I have ever been to, Cafe Besalu. I will definitely be booking this gem for my next visit to the Emerald City."
20927,21844051,2014-10-25,19963837,Neil,"This was a great spot for my 3 days in Seattle, and Brad and Liz made me feel very welcome.  Ballard is a great neighborhood!"
20927,21959011,2014-10-27,11247832,Jennifer,"My parents were in town for a short weekend and stayed at Brand & Liz's cottage. They absolutely loved the location and studio, and were thrilled to see Brad when we were at the Ballard Sunday market. It made them feel like they were in their own neighborhood. Thanks for making them feel right at home!"
20927,22195436,2014-11-01,2178894,Patricia,"Charming cottage in a great location.  It was well outfitted. Lots of art everywhere, both sculpture and paintings, which I enjoy.  This is my second stay there.  "
20927,22344145,2014-11-03,6707160,Melanie,"Brad and Liz's backyard art studio & cottage is a wonderful place to stay in Ballard. They were very welcoming and full of suggestions for great restaurants. The cottage is within easy walking distance of many options for food and entertainment, as well as bus routes, so we could have left our car parked for the weekend and not even worried about driving. It was clean and cozy and had a very comfortable futon. A bonus for us was getting to hang out with their lovely cat, Jasper. What a sweetheart! We'd definitely love to stay here again."
20927,22531326,2014-11-09,21826307,Lee,"Brad & Liz's cottage was a cozy, warm and accommodating home during our stay in Seattle filled with artwork and beautiful sculptures. Ballard is a very cool area with great small bars and restaurants and easy transport to downtown. They were easy to communicate with and their cats were adorable and welcoming. Highly recommended for your stay in the Pacific Northwest. "
20927,22682541,2014-11-11,23354137,Kristopher,Chanelle and I had a wonderful time. Your cottage was the perfect landing pad for our quick trip. You all were extremely hospitable and we appreciate all the food and cocktail advice. 
20927,22786095,2014-11-14,21732634,John,Great spot! Totally cozy and close to the heart of Ballard! I loved it! 
20927,23010731,2014-11-20,14166288,Adam,"The cottage was very nice.  Exactly what I anticipated based on the listing.  Brad and Liz were nice, I did not have much interaction with them due to my late arrival and working every day while there.  I would stay there again and recommend Brad and Liz's spot to any friends or family."
20927,25224886,2015-01-09,20402024,Nick,"Brad was a great host and wealth of knowledge regarding Ballard, re-introducing us to a great neighborhood I hadn't visited in many years.  The cottage was easily accessible, as was parking and quite comfortable.  Highly recommended for a Ballard stay."
20927,25502318,2015-01-18,17384443,Kaitlin,"A wonderful and inspiring space. Perfect location for walking to Ballard restaurants or even just relaxing inside on a rainy day. We were fortunate enough to balance  fun an relaxation here after a couple of days hiking around the Olympic Peninsula. 

Never got to meet Liz but I sure hope to someday as I loved her art and I imagine her garden to be one of the best. Brad was incredibly friendly and accessible with lots of great neighborhood recommendations. 

Only wish we could have stayed longer!"
20927,25875617,2015-01-28,13285403,Lynn,"Brad was very welcoming and related some of his life and travel experience with us. He spent time in Amsterdam where we live. We appreciated his collection of literature and his wife's amazing talent as a sculpture. The studio was very nicely furnished with wood work by Brad, art and sculpture by Liz. We liked the tile floors. The bathroom is small but adequate. The coach converts into a bed that did tend to cause the occupants to drift toward the center. Privacy in the living room section was somewhat compromised by the reed blinds that allowed a view out into the yard and, we assume, into the room. The small refrigerator is located right behind the head of the bed and we had to turn it off when we wanted to sleep. We are both light sleepers. All in all, we found the room very comfortable and conveniently located close to down town Ballard."
20927,26135502,2015-02-04,26085183,Matthew,"The cottage was great. Very peaceful. Brad provided tea to use in the cottage and when he realized that we were staying for the week, he bought more varieties to the cottage. 

The two cats are very friendly. 

This was my first time staying in Ballard. It was much more relaxing than other time I had visited Seattle. "
20927,26254779,2015-02-08,8903654,Nils,"Brad called to give us directions and met us when we arrived. The cottage was clean, quiet, and had everything we needed. Very interesting to be staying in an artist's studio! Brad also gave us a map and guide to the area, which we used extensively. Stoneburner cocktails for the win!"
20927,26433031,2015-02-12,7964157,Brent,"Awesome place, clean, awesome location, charming quiet and what I wanted! Brad and Liz are both great and hospitable and friendly. Highly recommended and a short walk to everything that I wanted to experience. I really liked all the art and sculptures in the place. Also very easy parking in the neighborhood."
20927,26597478,2015-02-16,25479304,Parker,"What a lovely cottage and such a fantastic stay we had! it was everything and so much more than what we saw through these pictures and description online. We thoroughly enjoyed all of the art on the walls, among the books and atop the shelves. We truly felt at home here and enjoyed coming back to the cottage each night after all our fun in Seattle. Thank you so much for being such great hosts and for the recommended spots! (Stoneburner and Cafe Basalu are the favorites!)

You two are such a wonderfully interesting couple and we enjoyed meeting you both. We definitely plan to come back and look forward to chatting with you once again.

Thank you!
~Parker & Candice"
20927,26899371,2015-02-21,17294567,Cassandra,"Brad and Liz are such accommodating hosts - bending over backwards to make the stay work for us while they were out of town. Though we didn't meet in person, they were incredibly easy to communicate with and even took the initiative to reach out and make sure everything was going smoothly. The space is very well-maintained and unique - overall a very interesting stay that I would highly recommend. "
20927,27057333,2015-02-24,9810231,Ruth,The cottage was amazing.  It was in a quiet neighborhood with plenty to do within walking distance.  The art is beautiful and gives the cottage a nice feel.  Everything was exactly as described.  The futon bed was very comfortable.  We got to meet Brad and Sam and it was very pleasant talking to them. They made us feel very welcome.  The cats were super friendly too!  Defnintely planning on coming back!

20927,27486288,2015-03-05,3546347,Kaela,"We had a lovely stay at Liz and Brad's.  The cottage was very comfortable, the flowers smelled divine, and Liz's artwork made it an incredibly unique space bursting with creativity.  We didn't get a chance to meet Liz during our brief stay, but Brad was very welcoming and recommended an incredible nearby bakery--a tip I am so grateful for!  "

The two cats are very friendly and there was a great selection of tea waiting for us too.  Location was perfect, a short walk to Ballard cafes, restaurants, shops and buses downtown. 

We would most defiantly recommend Brad & Liz's cottage to anyone who wants a great space to chill while seeing the sights of Seattle.

Many thanks guys, if we return we would not hesitate to stay again."
20927,28300519,2015-03-22,23428225,Marina,"Many thanks Liz and Brad for a wonderful introduction to Ballard and Seattle by having us stay in your cottage/art studio.

20927,28791594,2015-03-30,232493,Margo,"\We had a second great visit to Brad and Liz' cottage in the Ballard district of Seattle.  We're looking forward to a third stay. Perhaps for the owners' sake, we should keep this a secret, but Brad did our laundry.  Definitely above and beyond.  A charming cottage in walking distance to an historic, unique area of Seattle.   "
20927,29073687,2015-04-03,29993158,Wendy,"
We enjoyed our stay at this very artful, picturesque cottage. Brad greeted us and made sure we were familiar with the space and the general parameters of staying here. We were especially pleased to find that there was ample curbside parking for our vehicle. We felt welcomed and comfortable with the cottage."
20927,30816774,2015-04-27,10719532,Joseph,"Brad was very kind.  He asked us what are plans were and what kinds of things we liked to do.  He then made excellent suggestions about where to go and what to see.  Later in our stay, we caught some rare Seattle sunshine and just talked about life and things with Brad and Liz on their porch.

The apartment itself is a treasure trove of visual and artistic stimulation.  There was always something new to discover.

Excellent, excellent hosts and fantastic accomodations."

The decor is artistic and unique. Everything is clean and well-maintained. They are friendly and available to answer any questions. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in the Seattle area, and there is a lot to do that is close and doesn't require an intense amount of travel. The cottage is the best of both worlds of privacy without being secluded from all civilization. 

I will definitely book this place for every trip I make to Seattle."

There was never an issue of communication and they went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Thank you for letting us stay in your lovely little corner of the world. 
20927,33673107,2015-05-31,4533439,Erica,"We had a wonderful stay at The Cottage. Brad and Liz were welcoming and hospitable while making the place feel like it was our own. The cottage is clean and comfortable, far enough away from the Ballard scene that it is quiet, but close enough that it is walkable without problem. We tired ourselves out eating, walking, and seeing much of Seattle, and it was lovely to know that we'd have a tranquil place to rest when we were done."
20927,34052773,2015-06-04,28433498,Ryan,"Brad & Liz's place was awesome!
My girlfriend and I took a trip to Seattle to scope out future homes for next year when we move there from the Midwest. Brad greeted us at the cottage and was very flexible on arrival time. He made us feel very welcome and was very helpful answering questions about Seattle. He showed us all the hot spots in Ballard which was awesome. Their garden and studio/cottage is completely gorgeous. Their cats were very friendly and cute :). Definitely would recommend staying here. Its a quick bus ride to the downtown area, and Ballard is a very nice an quite place. It's a very pretty neighborhood. 

P.S.   Liz I loved your sculptures! I used to be really into ceramic and I envy your talent. :)"

I am so glad we stayed here, and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

With all the shops and cafes around it provides everything you could need for a week, including a shower with great water pressure.
Getting in was easy; they were on vacation themselves but one of their friends and their son took care of everything and truly made this a memorable and adorable stay. I would definitely stay here again! :D"

20927,45583389,2015-09-04,14076305,Claudia,"The cottage is in the perfect location, nestled behind an adorable home, surrounded by a garden and a short walk to downtown Ballard. Our host was warm and welcoming and available to help if we needed it. We enjoyed our stay. "
20927,46577794,2015-09-12,32915119,Lea,"Brad was there to greet us when we arrived. The accommodations were wonderful. It is a quiet neighborhood and the bed was comfortable so we slept well. Brad and Liz went the extra mile for us  and we spent some time conversing. Liz is a fabulous award-winning sculptor and we enjoyed her studio a lot. The cat, Lilibelle, is very affectionate and joined us on the patio a few times. The location is perfect for enjoying Ballard. We could walk wherever we wanted to go in Ballard. Mass transit is very good and the bus stop is a few blocks away. Next time we are in Seattle we will definitely seek to stay with Brad and Liz."
20927,46923863,2015-09-14,4992877,Andrew,"My fiancee and I had a great time at the cottage. Liz gave us a warm welcome, and their black cat, Jasper, made us feel right at home despite being 3,000 miles away from own beloved feline. He even stood on the sidewalk and said goodbye the morning we left! Anyway, back to the place: it's nice and cozy and we loved all of Liz's art. Ballard is a cool neighborhood to walk around in its own right and we had an easy time driving to downtown Seattle. I'd enthusiastically recommend this place to anyone looking for a quirky, unique, and comfortable stay in Seattle!"
20927,47317505,2015-09-17,6628468,David,"Communication was easy with Brad and Liz.  They and their daughter made me feel very welcome.  And it was a fun place to stay as I was surrounded by the beautiful art works of Liz!  The apartment was very comfortable and well located on a quiet street.

20927,47677671,2015-09-21,27662,Chris,"Brad and Liz's place is the best deal in Ballard. Their cottage is serene and a very close walk to the main drag. I would happily stay again!

20927,48879347,2015-09-29,24770014,Cassi,The cottage is cozy and had everything we needed.  Two resident garden cats kept us company when we hung out outside.  Brad and Liz were very helpful with advice of where to eat etc.  they also invited us up to watch the lunar eclipse from their balcony.  Great hosts!
20927,50330509,2015-10-11,3229888,Haley,"Thank you Brad and Liz for such an enjoyable trip! The cottage was cozy and charming and had everything we needed. The garden was so beautiful and our daughter loved eating the herbs right off the plants. Sorry the mint bush is stripped clean! Thank for you being such great hosts, we hope to stay with you again in the future! "
20927,51283001,2015-10-19,8263074,Fred,"If you are planning to visit Seattle and this AirBNB is available, don't read another review and just book it. The apartment is located in the best part of town within walking distance of amazing restaurants, great shops, and even a farmer's market.

All the neighbors are really friendly but they don't come close to the kindness you will be offered to by Brad & Liz. Great people who made sure our stay was as perfect as can be. We will be back."
20927,51767834,2015-10-24,45384903,Gina,"What a wonderful place to stay! Instantly, I felt at home by the welcoming hosts, Brad & Liz. Of course, I can't forget about the cats, Jasper and Lily. 

I was surrounded by comfort and amazing art. When in Seattle, you won't find a better place to stay. I'll definitely be back. "

The location is super walkable to all points in Ballard. Great spots to eat and don't miss the Sunday farmers market!  Brad was very welcoming.
20927,52375212,2015-10-28,9337962,Christine,"The cottage was exactly as described - clean, comfortable and quiet. I was sorry the weather prevented us from enjoying the patio and pretty garden more. Brad and Liz met us on arrival, gave us directions and recommended some local cafes. Jasper the cat also made us welcome. We were out most of the time so didn't have much time to get to know them better.
Ballard is a great neighbourhood to explore on foot with lots of attractive old houses and gardens. The Chittenden Locks were well worth a visit. 
We would stay here again: it was just the right combination of privacy and personal attention."
20927,53067381,2015-11-04,1572898,Afton,"We enjoyed our stay & thought the cottage was a great value! The location was quiet and cozy, while still walkable to the heart of Ballard. Bed was really comfortable, and once we had the space heaters going it stayed pretty warm in the cottage. Brad was very nice & helpful, and they had a bunch of city maps & info available."
20927,53707722,2015-11-11,16357053,William,"Great neighborhood; it is quiet, yet close to central Ballard, a very walkable location. The 'cottage' is very solid and well insulated, and the bed perfectly comfortable.  The garden environment is peaceful.  This accommodation was perfect for me, and I'd stay there again in a New York minute.  "
20927,53958602,2015-11-15,4376423,Rebecca,Brad met me on my arrival and gave me a tour of the cottage. The cottage is exactly as pictured and described. It was perfect for my plans for a concert and meeting up with family who live near Ballard. The cottage is very comfortable and clean. The bed provides an excellent night of sleep.

20927,55800355,2015-12-06,6705981,Toby,"Both Brad & Liz's cottage and the surrounding neighborhood are a pleasure.  The cottage is an art studio and there are drawings and sculptures, books, lots to look at.  We walked around the area in all directions; walked to the locks and the Nordic museum, plus cafes and restaurants.  "
20927,56170713,2015-12-09,22254531,Terra,"Staying with Brad and Liz was a treat! The studio is a separate building from their main house, so we never felt like we were intruding or had to tiptoe. The TV and mini kitchen were a nice touch. The artsy aspect from Liz's sculptures really made the whole space! Brad was a speedy communicator and everything was as described. I recommend staying here."
20927,56710222,2015-12-16,32835417,Savannah,Brad and Liz's cottage was perfect. The artwork all around our room was simply moving. Brad gave us some good pointers on the hip spots downtown and was great conversation. These guys were great hosts and would definitely recommend staying here!
20927,56801410,2015-12-18,2430308,Daniel And Patty,Brad and Liz were terrific hosts and the cottage is a lovely artist studio getaway filled with paintings and sculptures by Liz. I loved the cozy intimacy and the creative environment.
20927,56950633,2015-12-20,28450404,David,"This amazing Ballard artist's cottage was a joy to stay in. It featured amazing art, clean and useful amenities (small kitchenette), and is in a wonderful neighborhood. The Locks, old Ballard, and Golden Gardens are just a few blocks away. We ate at The Lockpost, a landmark restaurant, just down the hill. A great place for one or two folks to stay. "
20927,57450598,2015-12-26,25904614,Debbara,Brad & Liz's cottage was a comfortable and peaceful spot to recharge after holiday festivities with family. Surrounded by magnificent artwork & sculptures I slept like a rock! 
5060388,31953687,2015-05-12,30032521,Marko,"My girlfriend and I stayed 9 nights in the lovely cabin located in Carol’s Garden. Check-in was very relaxing even though we were very late due to a flight delay. Carol wasn’t there to let us in but a friend of her opened the door for us and showed us around. The cabin was clean and very very cozy. In addition to the alcove there was a comfortable queen size bed. The kitchen was well appointed so it was easy and fun to cook there or prepare a nice breakfast. Apropos breakfast: Carol left us bagels, Blueberry Muffins and coffee in the refrigerator so we didn’t have to worry about our breakfast the morning after our arrival. 
The Garden offers a nice place to have breakfast or dinner outside or to just relax and enjoy the sun. Carol has a Cat and a dog, both were very cute.
We had a great time in Carol’s Airbnb not least Carol is such a nice host, who gave us enough privacy but was always interested in a little chat. We would recommend this Airbnb who wants to live in a little Garden of Eden right in Central district close to several bus stations. Downtown is just a few minutes with the bus away, the neighborhood itself is safe and quiet. 
Thumbs up for Carol and her lovely cabin!"
5060388,32678788,2015-05-20,6625224,Adam,"We had an amazing time in the cabin, the pictures don't do it justice. It's a beautifully designed space, with everything you need for your stay. It was set in carols garden which gave a nice quiet getaway from the city around. Carol was brilliant and we enjoyed chatting with her and getting to know her. I would definitely recommend this place to others."
5060388,33237246,2015-05-26,1971189,Lo,"Super cute, peaceful cabin surrounded by a tranquil garden yet in the midst of a city. Great, walkable location just a few blocks away from Seattle's international district."
5060388,33469046,2015-05-28,3450531,Madeline,"Carol was a lovely host. She met us in person and gave us a little tour of the place, which was essentially what was described. We had a cozy stay in her cabin, and enjoyed the breakfast items she left in the fridge. We didn't use the outside areas surrounding the cabin as we were out and about most of the time, but Carol keeps many plants and flowers around her backyard area to create a serene environment. It's in a great, quiet location. Highly recommend!"
5060388,33992910,2015-06-03,22197234,Ian,"Carol's place is amazing, plain and simple. Small and cozy and located in the international district you are not far from all the amazing spots Seattle has to offer.  Carol is awesome and super helpful and even kind enough to leave us some snacks. Highly recommended!! 10/10!"
5060388,34418001,2015-06-08,30251430,Cheryl,"Carol is a wonderful host, she provided information about the area and restaurants.  The urban cabin is located in a quiet residential neighborhood but located near transportation, restaurants and within walking district to the International District and Pioneer Square.  The cabin is clean, cozy and much larger than the photos.  It's located in a flower filled tranquil garden and we enjoyed having morning coffee on our private bamboo garden. The  kitchen is fully stocked and Carol provides coffee and breakfast fixins.   Beautiful bedding, there is a new bed downstairs and cozy loft bed upstairs.  Quiet neighborhood and gracious host.  "
5060388,35682269,2015-06-21,15500690,Kelvin,Carol did an outstanding job keeping the cabin nice and clean. She was friendly and helpful giving us touring information. I will certainly stay in her place again next time visiting Seattle.  
5060388,38979243,2015-07-20,26326533,Chi Hua,"This is my fist Airbnb experience and it is so wonderful. My son and I stay in the cabin for one month. The cabin is very clean, comfortable and exact like pictures. There is a very pretty yard in front of cabin. You can read or just lay down there. 

The location is very convenient too. Only 15 minutes to king station and 20 minutes to stadium and 5 minutes to China town/ International District. There are several bus routes to downtown and other attractions.

Carol, my host is so helpful and warm. She takes care me and my son a lot. I enjoy chatting with her. Mimi, the friendly cat is so cute. She waits me in the yard to pat her. It is really unforgettable trip. I never forgot and hope to visit Seattle again.

Carol, thank you! We miss you and Mimi."
5060388,39482468,2015-07-24,28493113,Diana,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in dieser kleinen, gemütlichen Cabin, umgeben von einem lauschigen Bambusgarten. Netter Rückzugspunkt.Ich habe gerne die mit den Basics ausgestattete Küche genutzt. Gute Lage, wenn man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln unterwegs ist, drei Busse halten um die Ecke und fahren downtown und zur Metrostation Union Street, von wo aus man Anschluß in alle Richtungen hat."
5060388,39744382,2015-07-26,25193310,Cassandra,"This was our first time ever using airbnb and we were so nervous we'd have a terrible experience but it turned out great. The cabin looked exactly like the pictures, it was clean and private. Her cabin is in her backyard which is in the city yet felt like we were in a little oasis thanks to the beautiful back yard space and bamboo shoots for privacy. The neighborhood is in little sigon I believe, its not a terrible area and you can tell the neighborhood has residents that have lived there a long time. My husband and I felt comfortable enough to walk to a restaurant around 10pm Carol had suggested. Carol was a great host."
5060388,40896131,2015-08-03,2253492,Linda,"My friend and I found the cabin to be a perfect retreat at the end of our busy days in Seattle. The garden setting is so peaceful and the cabin had everything we needed. The location was great for us: easy to get to from the train station and easy access to Capitol Hill where we needed to be every day for dance workshops. Thank you, Carol!"
5060388,41591456,2015-08-08,871020,Tommaso,"We spent two nights at Carol's place during our west coast road trip. The separeted cabin in the backyard is nice, confortable and has everything you could need. Carol welcomed us warmly and everything was in line with expectations.
The neighborhood is not exactly the coolest in Seattle, but you can reach some nice areas (downown, capitol hill) in 20-30 mins walking."
5060388,41919272,2015-08-10,5429349,Eline,"Carol has a lovely cabin! The kitchen is fully equipped and the facilities are good. The queen bed is great. The loft a bit tide for two adults, but we knew that beforehand. Besides the cabin itself the garden is lovely as well and Carol is very friendly and helpful:) We had a great stay! We definitely would come back for another time."
5060388,42286301,2015-08-12,37280676,Patrick,"Carol is a welcoming person ! Her place is clean, cute, quiet and intimate. We recommend this place for couple without a doubt ! Easy access and free parking for those who come by car. Thanks for the hospitality. "
5060388,42530935,2015-08-14,30741137,Kyle,"Carol was very friendly and welcoming.  She took the time to give us a short introduction to the cabin.  The cabin is very clean and roomy.  Our 2 nights stay was cozy, comfortable and quiet.  Couldn't ask for anything else."
5060388,43027088,2015-08-17,824552,Emily,"We loved staying at the urban loft. I really enjoyed the location, it is located on the street I used to live on, which felt both wonderfully familiar and centrally located to do all of the things we came to Seattle to do. It is close to multiple buses that go both downtown, south to Columbia City and north to Capitol HIll and other neighborhoods.  We really enjoyed the space and the kitchen. There is a lovely space to sit outside on the sunny warm days. The cabin is a short drive to beautiful walks/bike/swimming on Lake Washington. The queen bed was very comfortable. We experienced both extremely hot days and cold during our stay and the cabin was equipped with both great fans and extra comforter. Carol was a delight to meet. She was warm and welcoming and also clear with cabin instructions. The urban cabin is a perfect spot for a get away."
5060388,43492873,2015-08-20,32624243,Christina,"Carol's cabin was just great for our short stay in Seattle! Carol was very communicative and we didn't have any issues getting to the cabin.

The cabin was very comfortable and the fridge was already stocked with coffee and a few snacks. The bed was super comfortable too!

The location was about 2 miles outside of downtown and so it was about a forty minute walk to Pike Place Market.

Would definitely recommend!"
5060388,43766221,2015-08-22,3535710,Neysha,"My friends and I had a fantastic stay at Carol's cabin!

Carol was a great host and made herself available at all times, even at our late check-in time.

This cozy and charming retreat was perfect for our brief stay in Seattle prior to getting on a cruise to Alaska. The cabin was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. Very true to the listing!

We absolutely loved the garden leading up to the cabin and the private seating area-they were absolutely gorgeous and well maintained. It was a treat to run into Mimi the kitty in the garden in the mornings. 

It was so easy to reach Carol's place from the airport and very easy to catch public transportation in the neighborhood. 

Highly recommended! :)
"
5060388,44422893,2015-08-26,1240941,Lorenzo,"We had such a wonderful stay at Carol's Urban Cabin.  It was beautiful and very comfortable.  The kitchen really helped us save some money on meals, we even had friends over for lunch in the lovely garden.  Carol is very helpful and discreet.  The location is great, we loved walking to the downtown area through Chinatown.  If you are coming to town for a Seahawks or Mariner game, the place is walking distance to both stadiums.  The walk to town is only around 30 minutes.  We found a really good Vietnamese deli that became our favorite too.
But Carol does a great job making the place warm and welcoming.  We left a bottle of Sriracha sauce as a small gift for future renters.  Haha."
5060388,44775444,2015-08-29,26134578,Nicholas,Carol's cabin was great!  Provided everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.  Carol was very helpful and accommodating.

5060388,49097387,2015-10-01,2660989,Tessa,"Carol was very welcoming, and immediately answered our text when we landed, and gave us easy directions to follow to her place. 
My father stayed there while he was in Seattle and described it as "" a garden of Eden"" and ""couldn't be better"". Carol was always available for questions/concerns and my father felt very welcome. The place was also very clean. He especially enjoyed the central location of the cabin, which was very convenient. We would rent from Carol again!"
5060388,49895036,2015-10-07,10661212,Wally,"This was an absolutely lovely little cabin for our Seattle stay. Carol was great, and the lovely garden setting was very relaxing. "
5060388,50093182,2015-10-09,14440659,Monica,"We had a great time at Carol's.  She was great at communicating before our arrival, was there to greet us and show us around the place, and then was perfect in letting us be.

A great place to stay, and I would highly recommend staying here. The next time I am in Seattle this is the place I will want to stay."
5060388,50936224,2015-10-16,206203,Amanda,"The urban cabin is a comfortable, affordable, and centrally located alternative to hotel lodgings. The kitchen is reasonably well equipped for cooking. Good internet. Both the main and loft bed are comfortable, and Carol is easy to work with and responsive. I can imagine how lovely the surrounding gardens are in spring and summer. I recommend this place."
5060388,51536528,2015-10-21,18595122,Robert,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and Carol made it super easy! Her communication was prompt and thorough and made us feel very comfortable. The cabin is very nice and felt very quaint and homey. Even though it's in an urban area, it felt very secluded and was very quiet at night. The bed was really comfortable and we slept well. I'm sure her garden is wonderful during the growing season. This is a great place to retreat to after the hustle and bustle of Pike Place Market."
5060388,52349710,2015-10-28,27671969,Lauren,"We had a wonderful stay at Carol's cabin! We had everything we needed, it was very clean and tidy, not to mention very cute!

Carol was very helpful and hospitable. The neighborhood is near the International district, with a large variety of Asian restaurants to choose from. All three places I ate at were delicious! "
5060388,54981499,2015-11-27,19597261,Steve,"This cabin fit our purposes exactly.  It was in a great location with restaurants in walking distance.  Carol made sure we were welcomed when we arrived, but we tend to keep to ourselves, which was not a problem.  The wifi worked perfectly so we could catch up on netflix.  We'd return in a heartbeat."
5060388,55186657,2015-11-29,33621989,Tinsley,Very nice house! 
5060388,55350590,2015-12-01,7803818,Danuta,"Carol's cabin was perfect for our mother/daughter getaway ....exploring Seattle for the first time. The location was very close to the central city (public transportation available), yet felt like miles away and 'cabin cozy'. Carol made herself available for any needs/questions that might arise; communications were great to accommodate our uncertain arrival. Thanks for the treats you left for us, Carol - a thoughtful welcome for a relaxing stay. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!"
5060388,56149689,2015-12-09,408599,Joseph,Carol's place was amazing! Everything from check in to check out was hassle-free and spot on. Highly recommend!

5060388,57995752,2015-12-31,41792996,Chris,"This accommodation was very comfortable and Carol made us very welcome. The cabin is in a convenient position: just a 40 minute walk or short bus ride to downtown Seattle.

5446180,36884318,2015-07-02,34403518,Tammy,"This condo was in a great downtown location - we walked to the Space Needle, Pike Market, the aquarium, etc.  The building had wonderful amenities - nice gym, coffee shop, small gourmet market, etc.   The condo was beautiful and felt very safe.  The sofa bed was broken and slanted down awkwardly at the bottom and the sheets provided were way too small and couldn't be used.  If you do plan on cooking much in the condo - would recommend stopping outside downtown area for food.  The markets in town are all gourmet markets with more ready made foods.  All in all  - we had a great trip!"
5446180,38425918,2015-07-15,15618233,Steve,"All was great. Zero host interaction, but everything was as advertised and ran like clockwork. Great location. Coffee, Sushi, market and more in the building. Highly recommended. "
5446180,40335078,2015-07-30,35271305,Sinead,Great apartment in a fantastic location! It was as the listing described. We really liked how there were restaurants and other things on the ground floors. The only thing we would say that it might not be ideal if you need a living area and are using the pull out bed. But that was just our needs and would totally recommend this property! 
113951,417506,2011-08-03,767996,Rivka,"Jill was wonderful. She called to make sure we arrived Ok and make sure we had everything we needed. She created a list of local restaurants for us and was overall a pleasure to interact with. The place itself was clean and very comfortable. I particularly liked the set back off the street location. We would definitely rent this house again.
Thank you"
113951,470071,2011-08-23,792385,Casey,"This was the best choice that I made, Jill's house is so nice and very cozy just like the way it looks on the pictures. She was so helpful and answers or returns calls every time. Within walking distance you have a supermarket, pharmacy, shopping area and a bus to Downtown. If you are driving to Downtown it only takes about 12mins. The inside was very clean, comfortable beds and we even had a welcome bottle of wine. I would come back stay here again."
113951,506818,2011-09-06,928774,Jennifer,"Highly reccommended!!!

I really enjoyed my stay at Oasis in the City.  It is a beautiful place and Jill and Rick (her fiance) are so incredibly sweet and accommodating.  I had a bit of trouble with the tv's and both of them were very responsive and fixed me up right away. The place is clean, gorgeous and has everything you need. And it is close to the downtown/ city/ market, Lake Washington and other nice Seattle areas.  There are some great Asian eating places close by too.  I especially like Vietnamese Pho (soup) and found a great place not far away.  I would absolutely recommend this ""Oasis"" to anyone who wants a great place to stay in Seattle.  It was a home away from home. Thanks Jill and Rick for everything and I enjoyed your wonderful hospitality!!!"
113951,530719,2011-09-14,863190,Nancy,Jill's house is absolutely just as beautiful as it looks online. The beds were very comfy and the kitchen has every convenience for a nice sit down dinner with friends or family. We found the neighborhood delightful an in walking distance to Seattle's wonderful transit system . Waterfront dining is also close by if you want to take in the scenery on foot.
113951,1774507,2012-07-23,1892222,Jean,"The location was easy to get around from and to.  The pictures and describtion were right on.  Jill was a joy to work with before, during and after our stay."
113951,1817915,2012-07-28,2191794,Ondrea,"Beautiful, fully-functioning, conveniently located home.  Perfect for two couples."
113951,5584865,2013-07-07,2599552,Jake,"Jill was an amazing host! We couldn't be happier with the communication, the house, and the hospitality. I would love to stay again. "
113951,5734372,2013-07-14,6805570,Sandie,"Jill's Oasis in the City is just that. It was a wonderful place for our family of 5 adults from all over the US to rendezvous and hangout. Although the whole house is beautiful, we especially enjoyed coffee and happy hour in the fenced backyard patio. Loved our stay there. "
113951,46910605,2015-09-14,15025644,Jay,"Oasis in the Sky is very spacious not to mention immaculate with everything we needed for a great stay.  The rooms are beautiful and the beds are insanely comfortable.  Staying at “Oasis” was like staying at a friend's home.  The place was warm and comfortable and it was easy to relax there when not running around the city.  Easy check-in and simple entry made arrival quick and efficient.  My wife said it was the best place we have ever stayed....and trust me, that’s saying something.  Jill is an excellent host and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.  In other words, we really liked the place! "
113951,49654979,2015-10-05,3311753,Barbara,"Very nice place. Clean, plenty if suplies. "
7699495,52656602,2015-10-31,41405331,Pavan,This place was great and I loved my stay!
7699495,53380403,2015-11-08,32543491,Molly,"We had a great time at this lovely Seattle condo. It was super nice, clean, and walking distance to everything downtown. If you have any business being downtown this is a great place to stay and very easy hosts to have! "
7699495,54253692,2015-11-17,8821878,Mark,"This place is awesome!  It's well maintained, in a great location, and android/drea are the most helpful hosts I've ever dealt with.  You won't be disappointed!"
7699495,56150457,2015-12-09,32923602,Emily,"Our trip to Seattle was amazing. Staying in Andric and Drea's apartment/condo made our trip well worth it. The location is perfect! It's pretty much walking distance from most places downtown. We rented a car but barely drove anywhere. Why walk, when most places are a good 15-20 minute walk away? Aside from location, Andric and Drea were great hosts. They're very quick to respond any time I had questions and they made sure I was comfortable through out my entire stay. They even allowed us to check in a little bit early because we arrived sooner than expected. The day before we flew in, they  informed us about the weather in Seattle, so my boyfriend and I could be prepared with what we needed to keep warm. The apartment/condo itself was beautiful. Very clean, spacious, and comes with anything needed to feel comfortable during the stay. Overall, I'd say, we couldn't have asked for a better stay."
7699495,56871491,2015-12-19,50322515,Jean,"Perfect location. Immaculate, comfortable apartment. Easy, timely communication with host. Couldn't have been easier. Thanks for an enjoyable stay(and the welcome goodies,too)! 
"
7699495,58160181,2016-01-01,49029343,Dan,"This is a terrific place to stay, centrally located in a well-managed building. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, completely equipped with everything you need. They even supplied ponchos and an umbrella!

The hosts are superb. Extremely responsive and communicative.

Having spent 10 days here, we recommend it highly."
2906694,16128567,2014-07-22,3376509,Ernestien,"Leslie was very friendly and helpful. 
The stay in the basement is particularly nice with children, as you stay in a large children'room, with lots of toys and a big trampoline outside. Some of the beds are more suitable for children because of the size. The double (bunk)bed is close to the ceiling.

The location and neighborhood is great with the lively Alki beach just nearby (nice views). We had nice breakfasts and diners there. We also took the water taxi from there which was very nice because of the views on Seattle downtown.

We think it is a good value for money.
"
2906694,17052826,2014-08-06,8525758,Mara,"Thank you so much for making our stay in Seattle perfect!
Leslie was such a wonderful host to us. 
From the moment I booked she was so helpful and kind, making us feel welcome before we had even arrived. 
She provided such a lovely basket with handy items and all sorts of useful information. 
The basement is so clean and every thing you need is right there. (Thanks for all the tea and coffee items to use, much appreciated as we kept forgetting to buy sugar)
Kitchenette, bathroom and laundry and there were so many toys for our daughter to play with. Netflix to watch at any time, we were all completely entertained when not out and about. 
West Seattle is such a excellent area. Shops, restaurants and the beach so close by. 
I would highly recommend any of Leslie and Andrew's properties. Super hosts and nothing is too much trouble!   "
2906694,17229079,2014-08-09,18422470,Deanna,"Fantastic! My 5 year old daughter was perfectly at home staying here.  The older kids and myself loved being so close to the beach, also not far from everything else Seattle has to offer.  Would recommend to anyone with children, very comfortable, all the amenities we needed! Thanks to Leslie and her family for letting us stay!!"
2906694,17298857,2014-08-10,10053543,Siwei,The basement is awesome. I will totally stay again.
2906694,17584864,2014-08-14,19035489,Gaëtan,"I really enjoyed my first airbnb experience with Leslie. The place was very confortable, spacious, conveniant and we had a lot of freedom and privacy. Leslie is very nice and she gave us a lot of advice to enjoy our stay. Thank you a lot"
2906694,17697714,2014-08-16,17587074,Audra,The apartment was great very clean and roomy.  The hosts were wonderful they kept in contact and offered us assistance if we need it.  Our family was very comfortable there we would definitely stay again
2906694,18136535,2014-08-22,19243102,Thomas,"We stayed 2 nights AG Leslie's home. Everthing went well, we had complete privacy. The room was clean and large, being used by Leslie's daughter normally. Kitchen well equipped, just quite dark as it is in basement. My daughter loved the trampolin in the garden a lot...

Reaching Seattle centre by bus takes some time (40 min about); there is a boat as well with a Shuttle to the pier (with waiting time for boat it took longer)."
2906694,18273994,2014-08-24,19836359,Cris,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay in West Seattle! The basement apartment was easy to find, clean  close to shopping and Alki beach. The neighborhood was also very quiet. 
Leslie made our stay very comfortable. She provided air mattresses, fresh towels and toiletries. She was easy to correspond with, too. I would highly recommend this place!

"
2906694,18327319,2014-08-25,10053543,Siwei,Second time stay at Leslie's. Awesome place. Awesome area.
2906694,19061163,2014-09-05,8268798,Brooklynne,"We had a really nice stay at Leslie's place. It was clean, nice and comfortable and she was very helpful. We only gave her a few days notice for when we wanted to come and she was very easy going about it. She had everything ready for us and she printed off the water taxi schedule so we would know when we should leave for it. We were a bit nervous about the beds because my boyfriend is 6'5, one looks a bit small and the other is a top bunk but it worked perfectly fine. We would definitely stay here again! "
2906694,19556560,2014-09-14,20697683,Carolina,We had a wonderful experience at Leslie's place.  Great location and family environment.  She had great toys for my kids to play with.  Gracias Leslie. 
2906694,19882945,2014-09-20,16023209,Blanca,"The place was clean and comfortable   My recommendation to the guest is to please stick up the kitchen with more pots and pans.  When I rent a place, it's so that I can save money and not eat out as much. I couldn't do this here because there were very few pots in the kitchen. Not even paper towels. The guest did provide towels but I found myself washing them because they smelled damp. The guest was very nice. "
2906694,20036358,2014-09-22,9921971,Steven,"We only got to meet Leslie for the last minute of our stay, but she was very nice and accommodating in our prior interactions.

This is a great little place for a family - lots of toys in what seems to double for a pre-school or large playroom for kids.

A large sized couple may find it lacking for bed space - The double bed loft is at the top of child sized ladder, and frankly difficult for an adult or two to manage. There's only about 24"" from your nose to the ceiling. Claustrophobes may not survive it.

The place had everything you might need for your stay; full kitchen, great shower, perfect location in West Seattle and a short hop to Alki."
2906694,20265570,2014-09-26,11920108,Jesse,"Leslie and Andrew were great, and responsive hosts. The basement apartment was comfortable and adorable!! Would stay again!! "
2906694,21361388,2014-10-15,20700041,Audrey,"Leslie home is fantastic! The apartment is huge, very comfortable and has everything you need or more. It should be perfect for a family. The neighbourhood is peaceful and access to public transport is easy. Leslie was promptly responding my messages and check-in/check-out were smooth."
2906694,21570453,2014-10-19,20769362,Sasha,"Leslie was a great host very responsive. The basement apt was great and had everything we needed however sleeping arrangements could be tight for more than one person. 
"
2906694,22161850,2014-10-31,22619026,Sandra,"Leslie nos enseñó el apartamento nada más llegar y nos informó de las atracciones de la ciudad y como llegar a ellas desde la casa con transporte público. 
El apartamento es muy acojedor y se mostraron muy atentos en solucionar qualquier problema que pudiera surgir durante nuestra estancia. 
Recalcaron que no dudaramos en pedir qualquier cosa que necesitabamos puesto que la cocina no estaba equipada al 100%."
2906694,22217357,2014-11-01,8108931,Sharan,"We didn't have a chance to meet Leslie but she made sure that everything was set and provided enough details in advance. The place was fantastic. Comfortable for five of us and very close to West Seattle. The room was colorful, clean and comfy. 

"
2906694,23537502,2014-12-03,22779292,Mandy,"Really good 2 nights stay. Cozy room and many children toys in the room. Leslie is very friendly and helpful, she even helped us print some important documents for us.Quiet neighborhood. Location is not convenient without a car."
2906694,24291959,2014-12-24,368937,Chetan,"Best host everrr ...
We were late for checking in and I had trouble opening door of basement so called her up late in night and Leslie did answer phone and helped me.  Was really nice of her. 
Thank you so much for the help Leslie,  I know where to stay whenever I visit Seattle henceforth..."
2906694,24575755,2014-12-30,2598767,Jackson,Stayed an extra night. Super easy and flexible!
2906694,24631685,2014-12-31,2598767,Jackson,"Leslie was a great host to us. We stopped by for two nights and was flexible with our schedule. The basement is awesome, you will feel just like a Princess, royalty in Seattle. Highly recommended. "
2906694,24681214,2015-01-01,14382955,Cherylyn,"We never had a chance to meet in person but from the messages we exchanged, Leslie was very kind and helpful! The place was in a nice neighbourhood and looked just like the pictures. Everything was clean and the room was very spacious, would definitely stay here again!"
2906694,25098223,2015-01-06,24498489,Jazmin,"Upon our arrival we were able to check in an hour early, which worked out perfectly. The room was clean and cozy with lots of toys. There was 3 beds which were perfect with out party of 5. Leslie was helpful with any questions I had. Overall it was a great experience and would definitely stay here again."
2906694,25291067,2015-01-11,25319668,Sook Yinn,"The host makes me and my friends feel very comfortable. Everything look exactly what showed on the pictures. It is a very spacious basement comes with a small kitchen. It is good for at least four persons. The room is clean and there is a small tv in the room. Leslie is a very considerate person. She pretty much had everything ready for you, which includes toiletries, towels and nail clipper. I would definitely recommend this place to stay."
2906694,25525601,2015-01-18,25148097,Gemma,"Leslie was a very good host. She gave the all instructions thru email and the instruction book in the apartment.
The basement was clean and organized. Very spacious. Everything was provided for our comfort....Also, very close to Alki beach,it was fun! Just the Apple TV- its a new animal for us,we had hard time figuring that out...but overall : very good place!
Thank you for hosting us, we enjoyed our stay."
2906694,25642894,2015-01-21,25165558,Arthur,Definitely a great place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone. A very great price for a great room.
2906694,25889354,2015-01-28,26438022,James,"Leslie and her husband are great hosts, and I strongly recommend this AirBnB if you are looking for a great place to stay in West Seattle.  The space can easily accommodate a small family, is very comfortable and clean, and a short walk to a good variety of restaurants.  There is an awesome trail by their house that leads right to Alki Beach which is a great area to walk around.   You can catch  a bus about 6 blocks away which takes you right to downtown Seattle in about 20 mins.  There's a great backyard with a small fire pit, a great shower, and a little kitchen for cooking meals.  
Overall I don't think you can get much better than this AirBnB  for the money.  "
2906694,25977584,2015-01-31,24820497,Heejae,It was good and comfortable. Thank you! 
2906694,26324611,2015-02-09,1727727,Kai,Had a great time at Leslie's basement suite.  A ton of room to spread out.
2906694,27220038,2015-02-28,24409969,Marissa,We had a wonderful time in Leslies Apartment! We had our separate entrance and everything we needed. With the watertaxi we we were  in 10 minutes in downtown seattle which is a nice experience
2906694,27972161,2015-03-15,26552869,Ruijun,Nice location near the beach and very quiet environment. Things like body wash and shampoo are available which was very convenient for us. Huge room space for three people.
2906694,28333506,2015-03-22,28475618,Jim,The accommodations were as advertised.  We were familiar with the neighborhood and that area of the city.  This fit our needs for our visit.
2906694,28520744,2015-03-25,26162711,Nisha,"Although we never met leslie, she was great at responding and the place is very quaint. The basement is very pink with princess toys everywhere, but it still felt homey.  "
2906694,28707860,2015-03-29,18760509,Kristin,"This was the perfect apartment for my trip. My two friends and I had plenty of room, and access to a kitchen was great. Leslie even made sure that we had a tea kettle when we asked if there was one already in the kitchen!
The area is really nice, a grocery store is super close and the drive to downtown Seattle doesn't take very long. We didn't end up busing anywhere, but there is a bus stop very close, so I'm sure it would have been convenient as well."
2906694,29171171,2015-04-05,9160650,David,"A really lovely place to stay, spacious and comfortable, the private entrance means it's perfect if (like me) you are in and out at different times and didn't want to disturb your hosts. 

The basement apartment was fully supplied with all the things you need for a pleasant stay, and the amenities were great. Some really useful touches like coffee for the morning and a little basket of essential bathroom supplies, which was great as I'd forgotten shampoo. The kitchen was great, the wifi top notch, the bed was super comfortable. Also the neighbourhood is leafy and quiet, but just a short 5 minute drive from the ton of great restaurants, coffee shops etc in West Seattle, and there was always space to park across the street. And Leslie was the perfect host, providing all the information I needed prior to the visit and showing me round the property, and with the key arrangements it was easy to leave when I needed to without a lot of logistical arrangements. Just a great stay all round."
2906694,30024986,2015-04-16,28635505,Myriam,"Wenn ihr eine ruhige Unterkunft sucht u ungestört sein wollt seit ihr hier richtig. Den Schlüssel findet ihr in einer gesicherten Box, Reisetipps u Infos zu Einkaufsmöglichkeiten u den Busfahrplänen liegen im Zimmer bereit. Das Zimmer ist soweit in Ordnung für Kinder gibt es massig Spielzeug u für kleine u große Kinder ein Trampolin im Garten das genutzt werden kann. Toll ist die Nähe zu Alkibeach. In die Downtown braucht man ca. 45min. Abends fährt nur noch die D/C-Linie nach Westseattle zurück deren Stops in Downtown nicht immer einfach zu finden sind, da es sich um eine Expresslinie handelt mit entsprechend wenig Stops, erkennbar an roten Markierungen. Taxis kosten um die 20 $."
2906694,30130450,2015-04-18,27758598,Rosheen,不需要遷就房東時間辦理入住跟退房，房東會提供密碼鎖，入住半地下室的小孩遊戲房，寬敞且乾淨，有帶小孩出門旅遊的家庭十分推薦入住。
2906694,30487886,2015-04-22,20659560,Max,We didn't meet our hosts as we arrived pretty late. But there was a lockbox so we had no problem to get in. The room was really big with two big beds for two people and a air mattress for two more people. We had a small kitchen and a bathroom. Everything was clean and tidy. There also was a small TV with a Apple TV where we could use Netflix.
2906694,30488733,2015-04-22,30856235,Devin,The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2906694,32621186,2015-05-19,32768190,Toyin,Our host was very welcoming and helpful. She clearly communicated the rules and provided information on getting around Seattle that was extremely useful.
2906694,37416723,2015-07-06,3177674,Mark,"Leslie was very personable and helpful answering our questions about how to get to downtown Seattle. The location was quiet and convenient as the nearest bus stop was at the end of the street about a 5 minute walk and groceries a 3 minute drive. The room was comfortable for the 3 of us. The only criticism we would make is that the kitchen equipment was a little lacking e.g. no tea towel, washing up liquid, and cork screw! For a longer stay it would be nice to have a place to hang and store clothes. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would return another time."
2906694,38111489,2015-07-13,31370878,Courtney,"Leslie quickly responded to all requests and accommodated our needs. The apartment was as described and we enjoyed having a home base for our Seattle trip. The neighborhood was awesome! It was quiet and easy to get to public transportation. We walked down to Alki Beach through the forest, which was divine. Parking was easy and overall this was a great fit for our family with two kids.  "
2906694,40288237,2015-07-29,33479299,Chia Chi,Leslie is a very kind host . She provide everything I need and the house is good and the kids loves their bed and toys. 
2906694,40324722,2015-07-30,2658875,Sulin,Leslie was a great hostess with a great place for a family :)
2906694,41183416,2015-08-04,37227372,Guy,Really a basement. Quickly removed some toys. I thinks this is a childrens room when not rented out. 
2906694,41402278,2015-08-07,37435212,Danielle,"We really enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  It was comfortable and quiet, and my kids loved the toys and trampoline.  We had everything we needed in the apartment. The neighborhood is very nice, although we were busy elsewhere in the city and didn't get to visit the park and Alki beach.  "
2906694,42519270,2015-08-14,32897395,Christine,"La maison est bien située, dans un quartier calme et proche des commerces, d'une plage et d'un ""water taxi"" pratique pour Seattle.
La chambre était grande, telle que décrite et montrée sur les photos, c'est une chambre d'enfant. Un peu bruyante cependant (route, buanderie et étage du dessus). 
Leslie nous a bien accueillie, elle est disponible pour toutes questions. "
2906694,42702284,2015-08-15,37509372,Chengyi,"It was geat,we have got enough space for six people, and had a good rest. I am sorry for that we did not message host that we are leaving because we were in such a hurry and forgot about that."

2906694,43611803,2015-08-21,32447716,Alain,"Our one day stay does not allowed us to take full advantage of the accommodation. The house is located in a quiet area.The room is convenient. Leslie is very attentive, willing to give infos and answers to our questions. I appreciated the business with Leslie."
2906694,44165624,2015-08-24,10893957,Wendy,"Leslie is a very nice host and the room is great especially if you're staying with kids. My daughter loved the toys and jumping on the trampoline. The bed is comfortable and the room is spacious. Leslie went out of her way to even drop us off at the ferry terminal which was so kind of her. She was very accommodating. I will say however, this may not be the best place if you are a very light sleeper since it is a basement apartment. There is some slight noise (TV, footsteps) from above. If that doesn't bother you then this is a great place to stay!"
2906694,44560853,2015-08-27,37897371,Michael,"What a beautiful house and it is so close to Seattle. Leslie is a great host and provided us with a lot of information about Seattle in a binder that she has for her guests.

We travelled with two boys and we all had a blast. We spoke with Leslie when we arrived and she was so a very nice and helpful person and staying at her home was such a fantastic experience.

Thanks Leslie for everything."
2906694,46293372,2015-09-09,40189766,Noelle,The basement looked just like the pictures show.  The neighborhood is very convenient to the city.  Leslie was very nice when we briefly met her at check-in.
2906694,47702299,2015-09-21,10699221,Adam,Very nice host.  Lovely basement. Perfect for our needs (4 adults and 3 kids). Close to Alki Beach and grocery stores. Easy to get on/off freeway.  Nice neighborhood. Good amenities. 
2906694,47863001,2015-09-21,23297426,Jitka,"The room is very nice, clean and spacious. The only problem was noise in the morning because you literally hear every step they make upstairs. Don't expect to sleep in but otherwise it's fine. Nice location too."
2906694,48230937,2015-09-24,25283894,Flint,"Leslie responded promptly to my messages and request to book the apartment. She and her family were very accommodating by providing a list of Seattle attractions, public transportation, and general recommendations. Instructions on checking in/out were also very straightforward and easy. Although the tv was a small computer monitor it was nice having access to the internet and an apple tv. The house is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood and very close to downtown West Seattle--where you will find several great bars and restaurants!

There were a few issues, however, that warrant a lower overall rating. The first is the room itself. Although spacious, it is in the basement and you can hear everything that goes on above you. There was a dinner party during our second night's stay and it was very loud. We had hoped to rest awhile after working all day but were unable due to the noise. 

The noise was also a problem during the mornings. If you have any aspirations of sleeping in past 7am then this location is not ideal. From expected noises such as footsteps to the more jarring sounds of people moving chairs, children throwing tantrums, objects being dropped, and watching television with the volume turned up, it was very difficult to rest. This was particularly disappointing given we live in a large city and are bombarded with similar noises in our apartment on a daily basis and were looking forward to a respite from this type of environment.

This would be an ideal spot for a family with children, but maybe not for a young professional.

1084084,18709578,2014-08-31,15565174,Adam,"We checked in very late, but we were still able to get to our apartment. The apartment was much better than staying in a local hotel."
1084084,20347596,2014-09-28,3880031,Michael,"PROS:

Unit has great views, was close to great venues for visitors and restaurants and very conveniently located in the city. Unit was clean and the building was very luxurious (lobby, amenities, pool, library, gym, were all fantastic). I loved the fountain lobby on the 8th floor. 

Stay Alfred was pretty great to work with, they were very responsive by phone. I told them about the issues below and they stayed in touch and were able to refund part of our stay. They have an app with all the apartment details and check in / check out were seamless. 

CONS:

2 major issues affected our stay. The unit smelled of smoke when we first arrived, enough so that I quickly became congested. It turns out the building has many smoking units and has central air so whenever neighbors smoked we would get to enjoy it. We left the doors/windows open the entire stay which minimized the smell but was inconvenient, glad it wasn't winter (note that it wasn't as bad as an actual smoking unit, leaving windows open clears it out, but still kind of nasty). The hallways reeked of smoke so imminent neighbors must be chain smokers. If you are allergic or sensitive to smoke I would steer clear. 

Blinds were inadequate to block much light, lots of ambient city light lit up rooms at night. If you prefer a dark room at night it will be hard to sleep here. "
1084084,21904886,2014-10-26,1008027,Nicole,"We LOVED this apartment. Conveniently located in downtown Seattle with free parking! I'd recommend this apartment to others and will stay again when we are in Seattle.

1084084,31358634,2015-05-04,31049531,David,"We had a fantastic stay at the Metropolitan Tower during our trip to Seattle.  The apartment was very clean, modern, and well furnished, with private washer and dryer, very convenient!  Jordan even has detergent provided!  The view was great!  Being in a corner of the building, the room provides a 180 degree view of the lovely Seattle streets below.  The location is close to everything, less than 3 minutes driving to Pike Place market and 5-10 minutes to get to the Space Needle.   Jordan was very accommodating and adjusted his schedule in order to fit ours in.  His instructions and guidelines are very concise and straight forward.  I especially enjoy the app (Alfreds) made specifically for our place.  It made navigation and finding places such a breeze!  I know exactly where to stay for my next trip to Seattle.  Thank you Jordan!"
1084084,32562396,2015-05-19,5839876,Michael,"Great experience, would stay again"
1084084,41215351,2015-08-05,35271305,Sinead,"Amazing apartment! Really large space. The two bedrooms were a good size and the master bedroom had a spacious walk in closest type area and a great ensuite. The living room area was big enough that we could put out the two trundle beds and still have the couches as a living area. The location was ideal, walking distance to the market (10mins max). There were also toiletries for us which was good. The only slight issues were that the trundle beds were not that comfortable and there were only four chairs for the dining table. Since it is meant to sleep 6 more chairs would be better. But it was a great apartment and the building had a swimming pool, gym and outside area. Everyone there was so friendly. "
1084084,41600275,2015-08-08,5478070,Thomas,"The metro apartments were absolutely amazing! We got amazing feedback from the group staying there. People were very comfortable.

It was beautifully furnished and centrally located to everything we wanted to do during our stay which made it the perfect choice. Thanks Jordan, we will be back soon!"
4531944,23706679,2014-12-08,20686482,Ingrid,"The cottage was absolutely adorable and so welcoming!  I stayed there while visiting my daughter, who lived only a few blocks away.  We greatly appreciated the goodies in the refrigerator and loved spending our evenings there having wine and relaxing after a busy day out and about."
4531944,25120843,2015-01-06,21063685,Emily,"Susan is the most gracious host! From her warm greeting, to every single square inch of detail and thought put into this cottage, it definitely made my stay worth while. Susan was easily reachable and was more than willing to answer any and all of the questions I had. The cottage is an oasis of luxury and comfort. Gorgeously decorated and very cozy. By far, nicer than any hotel I have stayed at. Quietly nestled in a cute area of Seattle-very walkable to shops/restaurants/grocery store/etc. My favorite being Green lake itself. Such a wonderful place to walk/run/ride a bike and admire the beauty of nature. Every need is within walking distance. You can also catch the bus not too far from the house. The cottage is just a short bus ride to the famous Pike Place Market, and many other downtown attractions. The location of the cottage was incredible. It allowed access to many different areas around Seattle. Such a positive experience staying in the Cozy Green Lake Cottage. I will most definitely be coming back and staying in this wonderful place. Thank you Susan, such a magnificent host and place!"
4531944,25297257,2015-01-11,25694379,Jennifer,"Right from the start, Susan was wonderful! Her communication with us was warm and welcoming and made us feel like we were her private guests, catering to our every need. The Cottage was immaculate! I felt like I was staying in a Pottery Barn magazine shoot! The finishes were quality...the bed was comfortable and cozy, the bathroom towels plush, chilled wine in the refrigerator, chocolate and crackers in the cupboards...seriously, the best experience I could have hoped for!
Susan even gave us a recommendation of she and her husbands favorite restaurant in the area.  I couldn't have asked for anything more..everything was ready for a romantic getaway with my husband!"
4531944,34939122,2015-06-14,28724131,Chad,"We traveled to Seattle in June as our 1 year anniversary trip, and we stayed for a week at the Green Lake Cottage. 

Communication was great from the start, and it couldn't have been easier to check in and out despite a very early morning flight. We felt welcome right away especially when we saw that Susan left us a bottle of wine with a note for our anniversary. She also checked in with us during the week and sent some great tips to enjoy the city.

Everything in the place was consistent with the listing, and it looked even better than the pictures. We loved how much natural light came in even with the shades closed. The bathroom was fully stocked with shampoo, qtips, a hair dryer, etc. We were definitely glad to have A/C as the week was pretty warm. 

We absolutely loved the neighborhood. It seemed all of the houses nearby had beautiful gardens, and the area was very quiet. There is a nearby running path around the lake that is a beautiful 3 mile loop and a fantastic donut shop on the way home for a nice treat (Mighty O). There was a grocery store less than .5 miles away where we stocked up food for hikes and picnics around the city. We also found plenty of great dinner options within walking distance. 

We rented a car and found it was very easy to park in the neighborhood. It was also really easy access to the expressway for day trips. We took the bus (#16) a few times which was really convenient from the cottage and a quick trip downtown. 

Overall it was a great place to stay!"
4531944,35223061,2015-06-16,3068854,Joyce,"We really enjoyed the cottage, it was clean, beautifully decorated and well equipped.  It was located near the lake.  Susan was a great host and was responsive to our needs.  "
4531944,35639883,2015-06-21,28582206,Byron,"The Cozy Green Cottage is appropriately named.  Our stay met and exceeded our expectations.  Everything you need is at your fingertips and more than enough room for two people.  The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet.  Fortunately for us, our son lives only seven blocks from the cottage.  This made our stay most convenient.  The Wallingford and Freemont areas of Seattle have great coffee shops, pastries shops and great food (locally owned and operated).  As a beer enthusiast, there are craft beers and beer gardens galore.

The cottage, the host (Myles) and the area could not have been better for Carol and me.  We highly recommend the Green Lake Cottage and the host.       "
4531944,36964958,2015-07-03,150701,Mike,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights at the Green Lake Cottage and were very happy! 
We communicated several times with Susan before our stay, got all the information about arrival and it worked out perfectly. There was a nice bottle of wine when we arrived as well as coffee for the morning. 
The neighborhood was really nice and quite and we always found a parking spot out on the street. The garden outside the cottage was really pretty and maintained.  We live in Tucson, AZ now so it was delightful to see robins out in the yard!
We were in Seattle during a heat wave so coming back to the cottage and air conditioning was super. We also enjoyed the sky lights..so light and bright during the day and nice at night too, to see the sky.
Thanks to Susan and Myles for a great stay, and a great overall experience.
Peggy H."
4531944,37144155,2015-07-05,30341177,Terry,"We had a wonderful stay! Communication couldn't have been nicer or speedier -- in email, text and in person -- and their thoughtfulness as hosts was evident in the little welcoming touches: refreshments, a guide to the neighborhood and an already air conditioned space during a heat wave. The cottage was airy, beautifully designed and appointed, and absolutely spotless. Had the weather not been so taxing, we would have spent time in the charming little garden as well. We would have happily stayed longer and anticipate returning again."
4531944,37650497,2015-07-09,17032384,Jeff,"I was delighted with the Green Lake Cottage. It’s in a perfectly quiet location yet is quickly accessible to the lake, restaurants, and transportation routes to the city center. The cottage itself is beautifully designed and impeccably presented. On top of that, Susan and team are amazingly responsive. I had a couple of questions that were answered immediately with follow-ups. My stay couldn't have been better."
4531944,38252779,2015-07-14,24530788,Ben,"The cottage was great! So clean, well kept, and fashionable. We loved how quiet the area was, but that we could also take a short walk and be in the trendy Green Lake area. It's also a short walk to a reasonably priced grocery store and nice Starbucks. It was perfect for our visit to Seattle! We would stay again when we come back to Seattle to visit."
4531944,40588900,2015-08-01,8354280,Andy,"Susan and Myles made were extremely hospitable and made our stay even more enjoyable. They left a nice welcome note and bottle of wine for us, and the cottage was spotless. It was so nice to stay in this beautiful neighborhood. While it is within walking distance to so much, the cottage feels like an oasis in the city. 

The cottage is fairly small, but certainly doable for 1-2 people. Plus, with all there's to do in Seattle, you really won't be hanging around inside the cottage too much. If you're planning a trip to Seattle and want it to feel more like home, this is your place."
4531944,40829976,2015-08-02,39276696,Jakkapat,"Amazing. As a first timer, the cottage had given the one of a kind experience. Thank you."
4531944,40946720,2015-08-03,36901778,Carol,"The Cozy Green lake cottage was just that and more. Cozy, but also light and bright and clean . It is situated in a private landscaped backyard for an indoor/outdoor experience. It is nicely furnished, with a very comfy bed, plush towels and everything you could need. Neighborhood was quiet and a short walk to cafes, a park/lake and close to everything. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommended it. Owner was very open and always available as needed, but also respected our privacy . Basically a 10!"
4531944,42128847,2015-08-11,693922,Lilly,"My husband and I arrived at the Green Lake Cottage (GLC) after an international flight, and were delighted to be met by a bottle of sparkling water, a kind note, and a clean, comfortable place to stay. GLC was so easy to find, convenient to public transportation and restaurants, and Susan and her family were incredibly attentive and communicative about every aspect of our stay. It was a treat just to stay in such a well-designed carriage house (tiny house aficionados must stay here!) and when my mom visits Seattle next I'll be telling her to stay here!"
4531944,42742690,2015-08-15,30323700,Andy,Cozy and very cute!  Clean!  Very nice!  Great location!
4531944,44490233,2015-08-26,1808673,Gali,Wow! This was the best AirBnB we have ever stayed in. The cottage is a magical oasis nestled in an adorable neighborhood. The pictures don't do it justice. The place was emasculate with the most comfortable bed ever and amazing design details. Susan and her team were incredibly responsive and wonderful to work with. We will definitely book again if we happen to visit Seattle again!
4531944,45941150,2015-09-07,5671744,Kelly,"What a delightful little cottage!! I had a wonderful stay from start to finish. The owners are friendly and communicative ... and their place is even more adorable in person than in the pictures. The cottage is beautifully appointed (like a magazine!), bright and clean, and has everything you would need for a visit--including a fully equipped kitchen and a private courtyard for enjoying a Seattle morning with a cup of coffee. I wish my stay could have been longer ... I will certainly be back to Greenlake Cottage! Thank you for your hospitality! :)"
4531944,46879135,2015-09-14,37238014,Tom,"Susan & her husband have done an excellent job with their cottage, where my wife and I recently spent 10 days.   It is a very bright, cozy, attractive place, perfect for one or two people.  The finishes are all high end.  It is very well equipped with refrigerator, cooktop, microwave, dishwasher, flat-screen TV, a very comfortable queen-sized bed, and Wi-Fi.  The neighborhood is quiet and is just a short distance from Seattle's beautiful Green Lake, a perfect place for a morning or evening walk.  Susan's communication was excellent from start to finish.  I don't think you'll find a better place for one or two people when visiting Seattle.   "
4531944,47364054,2015-09-18,20400433,Katie,My husband and I stayed 4 days and loved this little cottage! It is worth it! So cozy and even better than the pictures! Best air bnb we've stayed in. Great restaurants and green lake in walking distance. We loved exploring Fremont and Ballard as well! Wonderful place and wonderful hosts!
4531944,47646384,2015-09-21,25970030,Tyler,"Susan was a super host from start to finish and Green Lake is a delightful respite! Wholeheartedly recommend this lovely cottage that is perfectly situated to take advantage of Zoka Coffee, Mighty-O Doughnuts, Elysian Brewing, Green Lake recreation trails and just a quiet, safe and fun neighborhood. The cottage is super clean, comfortable and has everything you need to enjoy a relaxing stay. "
4531944,48511326,2015-09-27,28112037,Jennifer,"The Green Lake Cottage is charming, well appointed for your needs and designed and decorated beautifully. Susan is a fabulous host - very communicative, attentive and energetic - she wants to make sure you have a perfect time.  A few of our favorite aspects of this property: the overall design and decor, the walk-ability of the neighborhood to restaurants and the lovely Green Lake.  I would highly suggest this property to anyone as you won't be disappointed! "
4531944,49049344,2015-09-30,31610328,Leslie,"Hosts were very helpful. We did not meet them in person but stayed in contact if we needed anything.

The place is VERY nice, but also tiny. I really enjoyed my 1 night here, but for a longer stay it would have been too cramped.

This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle, closer to Wallingford than Greenlake in my opinion. It's a quiet residential area, but very close to multiple neighbors. Thin walls, tons of windows, and proximity to other houses - may not be private enough for some people.

I would definitely stay here again if the need arises, but I wanted to point out a few things for prospective guests."
4531944,49426424,2015-10-04,8158013,Kendra,"My husband and I stayed at the Green Lake cottage on the last leg of our Seattle and Portland vacation. The cottage was clean, bright and very homey. Although we didn't meet our hosts in person, Susan, Miles and Katie were very welcoming and responsive to any questions we had and made checking in and out a breeze. Green Lake is just a short walking distance away from the cottage as well as some nice restaurants and cafes. We highly recommend having dinner at mkt, recommended to us by Susan and it was fantastic! We wish we could have stayed longer and would recommend the cottage to anyone traveling through Seattle!"
4531944,50789688,2015-10-14,1126242,Melissa,"Susan made me feel welcome from our first contact. She is a lovely host with just the right amount of involvement (attentive not intrusive), same goes for the check-in hosts, Myles and Katie. The cottage is perfect and pristine, and homey too with amenities (hairdryer and iron and more). It is well appointed with cooking ""gear"" if you're into that. The place is charming and so well situated. It feels private, and the grounds are aesthetically pleasing as well. The neighborhood offers so much and Susan was quick to give pointers. Fun neighborhood with tons of walking. Street parking is a breeze. I'd be delighted and honored to return."
4531944,53146679,2015-11-05,43780439,Irene,"What a really fantastic cottage.  We couldn't have asked for anything more than maybe to spend more time in the garden.  Everything was perfect for our stay, providing a respite from our heavily family focused days.
We will try to return here on our next Seattle visit and highly recommend it to couples who want to be in a great neighborhood that is close to everything."
4531944,53231817,2015-11-06,578490,Jake,I had a wonderful time in the Cozy Green Lake Cottage. It was beautiful and comfortable. The skylights during rain were exactly what I wanted in the Pacific NW. Would stay here again.
4531944,54011766,2015-11-15,42777840,Bianca,Susan was very helpful. Great neighborhood.
4531944,54410720,2015-11-19,7390119,Amanda,"I had such a great stay at this adorable cottage. The cottage was designed beautifully and very well-maintained. Susan was a delight. She was incredibly helpful, warm and personable. She checked up on me via email/text but wasn't intrusive. The location can't be beat. Close to restaurants and shops and just a short drive or bus ride from downtown. Highly highly recommend!"
4531944,58010776,2015-12-31,4262844,Amy,"The cottage is VERY cozy and comfortable.  All the amenities you could want in an airbnb.  A perfect spot for a couple.  
Susan was really helpful with neighborhood recommendations, and the surrounding area is really cool, with some of the best restaurants/bars/donut shops in the city!
We felt very welcomed (they even left a bottle of wine for us!), and we were excited to call the cottage home for a few days."
4531944,58476300,2016-01-02,43206423,Julie,I loved how quaint this adorable little cottage was! The area is perfect (Greenlake is a few blocks away and there's a QFC within walking distance)! Communication with Susan was fluid and I always got a response when I reached out to her. 
9866461,58253926,2016-01-01,16113799,Forrest,Eric was incredibly polite and accommodating. His place was clean and as pictured. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Building has plenty of parking and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. Very convenient and a great value. I would recommend stating here. 
6557018,42483784,2015-08-13,40818305,Carolina,"The loft was very spacious and comfortable and Valerie provided all the necessary ammenities including toiletries, towels, and linens. It was a beautiful place and not to far from the city. Just about 15 minutes from Seattle. Overall a great stay for our night there."
6557018,42755403,2015-08-15,6513512,Tim,"This studio was clean, classy and comfortable. We had everything we needed to make our stay in Seattle perfect. It was very easy to get into downtown Seattle by going south on 15th Avenue. All in all, it was a great experience!"
6557018,43145640,2015-08-17,32310340,Cara,"Our plans changed so I cancelled this reservation, but Valeria is really communicative."
6557018,43459501,2015-08-19,39856281,Brandon,"The listing was very accurate, just as pictured. Valerie was a great host. Our check in and checkout times didn't quite match up but Valerie was very accommodating and left us with access instructions. We had plenty of parking and great access to the bus to get downtown. "
6557018,44029796,2015-08-23,41188088,Kristina,Overall the stay was great! There wasn't much of a description about the appliances that were available so we had to run to the store to grab coolers. Valarie was easy to contact and she responded in an appropriate time with answers. 
6557018,44506078,2015-08-26,42319140,Velorie,"Valerie was very accomodative to our last minute plans to extend our vacation a few extra days in Seattle. Nice place, glad we were able to stay there!"
6557018,45533739,2015-09-03,3114335,Drew,"The loft was charming and clean. We were out and about and didn't spend a lot of time there, but it was very comfortable. We would be happy to stay there again."
6557018,45632099,2015-09-04,21039091,Aaron,Very easy location. It was clean. Loved the bathroom. My only critic is that 15th is a pretty busy street so it can get loud but it wasn't that bad.   
6557018,49870833,2015-10-06,10234390,Kyle,Valerie was super accommodating even though we made a request literally at 5pm the same day we wished to stay. She hit me back within a few minutes and we were ready to check in within the hour.
6557018,50363956,2015-10-11,8434233,Will,Had a great time. Loved the location.
6557018,50977558,2015-10-16,35994989,David,"My colleagues and I came into town for business and stayed at Valerie's condo. It was great. Extremely convenient, parking right outside the front door on the street, and she was available at anytime for questions. One thing to note, and it was not a negative for us because we weren't there very often, but she does not have a true kitchen in the unit. She has a small fridge, coffee machine, toaster oven, and few accessories, but that's it. The sink is in the bathroom.

Again, we loved the spot. But if you're looking for a kitchen in the unit, it might not be quite right for you.

I would gladly stay with Valerie again!"
6557018,51810308,2015-10-24,46165312,Nancy,"Had limited contact with host.  She left the door open for us and the key on a table .  We had our own entry in to the studio.  Loved the coffee pot and coffee left for us by the host.  The space was big enough for two people.  A light by the bed would be helpful.  The water pressure in the shower was low, and no instructions on what to do to check out.  We very much enjoyed our stay in the Studio."
6557018,54488103,2015-11-20,17023233,Kerrie,"I have coordinated two special events at this particular venue. The first time we rented the entire townhouse for my daughters bachelorette party with 10 guests! The space was amazing... Valarie has created a modern space with decor and dishes that were perfect for our occasion. We had hoped to utilize the rooftop but it happened to be too windy for our Moroccan themed tent... So we moved it indoors with a bit of shifting of furniture :) it worked out just fine. Valarie on each stay was available to meet a few requests with early check-in and extra dishes on the second visit for the studio. The only hiccup was needing some backup restock for TP that had been overlooked by the cleaning crew. She was gracious in her apologies on the oversight and made herself available for any need we might have going forward. I adore this space and will keep it at the forefront for further occasions we might plan as the Ballard community is a great place to stay in for all the delicious restaurants and shops therein! The townhouse does have extremely steep staircases so it may be a problem for anyone needing handicap access to upper levels, but the downstairs studio off the Main Street seems like it might work for a stay that does not require a kitchen and the bathroom is a large space and the shower is big and open. Valarie mentioned she may have some new Airbnb spaces opening in Feb... I will definitely keep an eye out for those as well! "
6438518,35235691,2015-06-16,33671318,Marie,We loved this place. Nice and clean and a great location to all the Fremont/Phinney neighborhood's Seattle has to offer. We will be returning again for sure.
6438518,35357658,2015-06-17,26491673,Maria,"Hugo is an amazing host.  The entry process was easy and high tech!
His home is beautiful, clean and new.  He has done a great job remodeling and decorating this cozy, comfortable space.
The location is excellent, across the street from the Zoo and truly at the intersection of Fremont, Wallingford, Green Lake and Phinney Ridge so near a lot of cool amenities.
I regret not getting to meet Hugo as he was amazingly helpful but hopefully another visit to Seattle."

6438518,44435871,2015-08-26,30310009,Genevieve,"Hugo's intention to look after people in his home is remarkable.After a very diffiicult and dissapointing Airbnb booking in New York which resulted in Hoteling it for 6 nights and $2300.00 later. Hugo's home was light relief. Not being a coffee drinker and my travelling companions on this constant search for good coffee. I learned how to use your great coffee maker for them!! Thanks Hugo for all your assistance, a bit surreal as you were there for us but not visible! Great shots at the park accross the road, thanks for the restful time :)"
6438518,44691838,2015-08-28,40966730,Anthony,"First Airbnb experience -- awesome! A very nice space in a great part of town. Fits 4 comfortably, takes in much light, and has a cozy / private feel. Hugo is very responsive and helpful. "
6438518,46178542,2015-09-08,41218893,Emily,"Hugo's space is ideal. He has thought of everything to make a short or long stay very comfortable. We really appreciated having a kitchen that was fully equipped to make our own meals. When we return to Seattle, we will certainly try to stay in this modern and comfortable space again. I highly recommend!"

6438518,46895625,2015-09-14,39543856,Ann,Hugo is definitely an awesome host. I arrived there early in the morning and he not only let me check in and also very nicely opened the door for me even though he just woke up. (I am so sorry Hugo!) The apartment is clean and tidy. Great size for two couples. Totally enjoyed this trip and will go back again! :D

I was breezing through the neighborhood on a bit of a busy business trip, so I was mostly interested in getting a good nights sleep, but they gave me some great  information about the area to use during my free time.  The place was spotless, with everything I might have needed and in a wonderful location.  Plus they have an extremely friendly cat and dog that I was delighted to hang out with.  I would be happy to come back and stay with them next time I am in Seattle!"

Great restaurants nearby offer plenty of choice. Lee provided excellent communication and some excellent tips about Seattle and the local area.  Kerry Park offers great views over the city and is only a few blocks away. Lee does have pets which didn't cause us any concerns at all. The apartment is compact and comfortable.

Lee let us have the place to ourselves the first night. He made sure we are comfortable and asked if we needed anything . Lee was responding to my text almost right away. He gave us good tips on places to go. The place was very clean, just like the pictures . The neighborhood was beautiful and safe. There was a nice little downtown and a wonderful view of the city within walking distance to his apartment
I would highly recommend his place to others."

We slept well and enjoyed a delicious donut for breakfast at a cafe on the corner.  The apartment felt squeezy with us the in the bedroom and Lee in the living room, but it was fine for a night."
