1071843,5844792,2013-07-19,6583908,Emily,My parents stayed here for two weeks and had a fantastic experience! They felt like they actually lived in Seattle for two weeks! Wonderful home away from home.
1071843,6107283,2013-07-30,467436,Sue,"Wonderful apartment, great location and parking included...
I stayed over a week, and the apartment worked out for me perfectly.  I was in town for a family wedding and between the parties, dinners and the wedding itself, it was great to have my own place in the center of everything.  I highly recommend this apartment! "
1071843,6195855,2013-08-03,2168441,Mark Arthurson,"Location is outstanding - if you're looking to see the Seattle Center it's a VERY short walk to Space Needle, EMP, etc. Pike Market isn't far at all either. However it's not proximity to attractions that sets Serina's place apart. 

From the moment we came, she had EVERYTHING for us to make it a comfortable stay. From indoor slippers to luggage stands, pastries for breakfast and even a vase (we asked for one since we wanted to purchase fresh flowers at the market) she had it all. The space was really clean, obviously she takes good care of her units. Not much noise in the area too so we slept very comfortably. Outstanding experience and should we come to Seattle again, I'd be quick to look for one of Serina's spots."
1071843,6388776,2013-08-11,5962432,Bill,"We enjoyed our stay at Wake Up by the Space Needle.  Our apartment was very clean and had the necessary items that made us feel at home.  Our host, Serina, was very helpful and provided us with maps and directions to local attractions.  She helped us with bus schedules and other transportation information.
Serina was pleasant and always available if we had questions or needed instructions on how to use washer/dryer, etc.
The location made it very easy for us to attend the opera and get around to other parts of the city.  
If we ever visit Seattle again, we would definitely plan on staying at the Wake Up apartment.
Serina was a great host!!!"
1071843,6468655,2013-08-13,2317044,Sarah,"Serina was a wonderful host! It was great that she could show us around the apartment during check-in, and she was so accommodating to our fluctuating schedule. The apartment was beautiful and comfortable and had all of the kitchen utensils, toiletries, etc. that you could ask for. The location of her place was ideal for walking around downtown and for taking the bus anywhere in Seattle. The pass-code deadbolt on the door (as opposed to a keyed entry) was also ideal for my friends and I to come and go independently and not have to worry about sharing a key.  This was a great place to stay, I would highly recommend it!"
1071843,6622992,2013-08-19,7177153,Candice,"Excellent, clean apartment, ten minute walk to Safeway and coffee shops, 25 minute walk downtown. Laundry and dryer a bonus! Very noisy street with buses, general traffic and people in the street late into the night. Great view of the space needle! Quiet neighbours. Just be sure to arrange parking in advance with serina otherwise you'll have to pay for on street parking or a pay lot. Venetian blinds only in the bedroom so expect to wake up with the sunrise! Coffee machine was a nice extra. "
1071843,6940077,2013-08-31,4050261,Lauren,Beautiful apt and gracious host.
1071843,7033763,2013-09-04,737226,Kirsten,"this is a really cute, convenient unit with everything you could want! it's very clean and open, and having a code instead of a key is super easy. if you like to sleep with the windows open, be aware that there's quite a bit of street noise (which should be obvious given the awesome location). the kitchen is really well stocked, and the wi-fi is great too.

Serina is truly awesome - so flexible and really communicative and generous!

(although a note for future Bumbershoot attendees: the unit is less than 2 blocks from the middle of the Seattle Center, but you will have to walk up or down to the northern or southern entrances during the festival - a little more distance but still very walkable.)"
1071843,7276913,2013-09-14,2930151,Amy,"We had a great stay at Serina's apartment in Seattle. The apartment was spacious, clean and well appointed with extra amenities including  a Keurig coffee/tea maker, toiletries and even pastries for breakfast. Serina met us when we arrived so check in was easy. The neighborhood was very walkable to lots of restaurants and bars and basically across the street from the Seattle Center (where the Space Needle and some museums are located). I would consider staying again if ever back in Seattle!"
1071843,7457081,2013-09-21,4746621,Emily,We were very welcomed by Serina.  The apartment was clean and we had everything that was needed to make our stay enjoyable.  I would recommend this location to others.
1071843,7580485,2013-09-25,985345,Hallie,"Our stay at Serina's in Seattle was great. She was very thoughtful, and had everything there that we might have needed or forgot to bring with us. The apartment was really nice, and the view was spectacular! The location was very convenient, within walking distance to Experience Music Project and the Space Needle. When we go back to Seattle, we hope to stay with Serina again. Highly recommended."
1071843,7671790,2013-09-29,8143391,Erin,"This apartment was perfect - the location was easily accessible to many of the must-see Seattle sights, the space was spacious and meticulously clean. Serina made the process very easy and had thought of everything that a guest could ever need."
1071843,7835515,2013-10-05,7709322,Louis,"If you love the space needle and it's 1962 architecture as much as I,  this apartment has you lying in bed and looking directly at it like it was a night light!  
My mother and I checked in late, and we were fortunate to have Serina's husband show us where to park and where to go.  I really appreciated that, as I was confused.  
The convenient parking in the back was a plus!  Down the street is the metropolitan market at Mercer and 1st, where you can get soups, sandwiches, and everything you need.  
You can drive down the street to Pikes market, and you can hop down mercer street to catch Highway 5.  
Loved this location!  
And I loved the coffee, and clean kitchen.  But who wants to cook, when you can have lunch and dinner on top of the Space Needle!!! 
My mother slept very well.  
"
1071843,8094974,2013-10-15,6172428,Surabhi,"Serina's place is in a great neighborhood, within walking distance of great restaurants, shops, and downtown sightseeing. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and convenient. My husband and I were very impressed with how easy the whole process was. Serina was flexible about check in and check out times, and also very communicative and helpful. We plan on staying here again next time we are in Seattle. Thanks, Serina! "
1071843,8355386,2013-10-27,9296262,MIchele,"The apartment was immaculate, comfortable and spacious. Was a perfect location for us. You really do look right out at the Space Needle from the bedroom windows. It was great to have a separate bedroom so we could hang out after our 6 yr old went to sleep. Also great to have a kitchen so we didn't have to eat every meal out! This is the advantage of an apartment over a hotel room. Serina is helpful and welcoming. We will likely go back again. thanks!"
1071843,8642517,2013-11-10,2215503,Jacob,"Staying at Serina's apartment was absolute perfection. I stayed for 6 nights and it felt like home. The apartment is spotless and has very impressive brand new appliances, like a super powered LG washer dryer combo, a fantastic dishwasher, hairdryer and an excellent steam iron for clothes. The kitchen is sparkling and has everything you could need. The living room is gorgeous and has an enormous flat screen TV. It's also an easy walk to downtown and 4 blocks to a huge gourmet supermarket. I highly recommend staying here!"
1071843,8795537,2013-11-18,1001726,Debra,"This is a really nice little space in a fairly quiet area just outside downtown Seattle! Close to anything downtown and easily accessible by bus and taxi (you don't need a car - really). The bathroom and kitchen are stocked with everything you'd need to cook and clean yourself up. There is a bit of street noise at times, particularly during commute hours, but nothing that is too bad...it's actually pretty tame for being on a major street. The bed is comfortable and the Space Needle is definitely front and center in the bedroom window.

The only blemish that keeps this from being an A++ space is the Internet - at times, it was downright unusable. Serina and her husband were most gracious about it, but it did not seem to improve even after multiple resets - we ended up having to use our portable hotspot for reliable service. Tests revealed that it was not a downstream issue - network congestion appeared between our laptops and the WAP (which is not actually in the apartment, so its location could also be an issue.)

Still, this is the only issue on what was otherwise a great experience, and we'd definitely come back."
1071843,9114374,2013-12-08,122708,Brianne,"Serina was a great host, and we loved the apartment! The location is fantastic (it's so close to the Space Needle and to the Key Arena, which is perfect for seeing a show and walking ""home""), the view out the bedroom window is gorgeous, and the amenities in the apartment were very thoughtful. We'd love to stay here again! "
1071843,10249479,2014-02-09,11484847,Stephanie,"Serina was a great hostess, very helpful and easy to work with. The apartment is adorable! Great location near Seattle Center and in the heart of Lower Queen Anne. Definitely recommend both her and the apartment! :)"
1071843,10781874,2014-03-07,2304586,Julie,The apartment is conveniently located with on site parking available (only $5 per day or $10 to park inside the garage) with easy access up one flight of stairs.  It is clean and has everything you could need for a stay in the city.  The owner is very responsive to messages and works hard to make sure everything goes well.  I would highly recommend this place - way cheaper than a hotel plus you get a full 1 BR apartment with a kitchen.
1071843,13288160,2014-05-24,421637,Anna,"Serina's apartment was perfect, I'm very glad we decided to stay here. The place was a very short walk from the space needle and monorail station, very centrally located and in a good neighborhood. I was suprised at how quiet it was given the central location, I expected a lot more noise being so close to the center, but it was actually fairly quiet and hardly any noise at all. The apartment itself was very clean and  spacious and had all the basic necessities available, as well as a few extras (really enjoyed the k-cup brewer first thing in the morning). Serina is easily reached by phone if we had any questions, and makes the check in and check out process very easy and smooth. We would highly recommend staying here, I don't think you could do better. Should our travels bring us back to Seattle we would definitely stay here again. "
1071843,13563280,2014-05-31,494167,Brian,"just as promised, very nice"
1071843,13951150,2014-06-09,5467660,Nicole,"Very tidy and clean, great location, non-intrusive hostess. Definitely recommend. Thanks for a very pleasant stay."
1071843,14552721,2014-06-22,259571,Alison,"Serina's apt near the Seattle Center is in a perfect location.  We walked in every direction from the apartment and enjoyed exploring the surrounding area and found lots of great restaurants, bars and bakeries
.  The walk to downtown Seattle along the waterfront was also very easy  The apartment is well equipped, bright, airy and uncluttered.  Booking and communication very easy. Highly recommend.
"
1071843,14701946,2014-06-24,215659,David,"Excellent apartment.  Lots of room,  comfortable furniture and we'll decorated.  Spotless.  Walk to lower Queen Anne, it's like being in a laid back small Manhattan.  Double pane windows.  Queen bed futon mattress medium softness, big feather pillows, thick towels. The works.  As advertised up one flight, no problem for us age 61.  Proactive host kept us informed and was ready for any needs we might have had.  Five stars. "
1071843,14911300,2014-06-29,8900741,Elizabeth,"I stayed at Serina's apartment for 4 days for a business conference. The apartment was great - convenient to downtown, clean, spacious, and well-stocked with everything I needed. I would absolutely stay here again - it was a great deal and a great experience."
1071843,15451859,2014-07-09,1001726,Debra,Serina is a wonderful host and has a wonderful little gem of an apartment just north of downtown. It is currently our go-to space when we visit Seattle and we can't recommend it more highly. The problems with the internet that we described last time have been largely fixed. A+++ would stay here again and again.
1071843,16244204,2014-07-24,13903294,Brandon,"Serina was an excellent host, and the place was better than expected. Literally a block away from the KeyArena I couldn't ask for a shorter walk. The apartment was clean, tidy and fully equipped with dishes, sheets, and even fresh bakery! A+ would recommend to friends and family."
1071843,16896650,2014-08-04,245297,Bert,The unit was exactly as advertised and even was greeted with pastries when we arrived. Location was very convenient as well. I would definitely book again when I plan to come back to Seattle.
1071843,17209215,2014-08-09,15297639,Ian,"The location is excellent. The apartment was very clean and well equipped which made for a very comfortable stay. Certainly a much better alternative to a hotel room as the space, kitchen and laundry facilities make like being at home.
Serina is an great communicator and unobtrusive host. She responded promptly to our emails and even had a tasty treat awaiting us on arrival. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again and will be recommending this listing to family and friends."
1071843,17556661,2014-08-14,8340088,George,"The apartment was great. Incredibly clean and nicely furnished, it made us feel home after the long plane flight. The washer dryer and dishwasher were super convenient for a longer stay. The neighborhood is awesome. "
1071843,17764362,2014-08-17,7732484,Wiseley,"The location is great, it's walking distance from the tourism cluster of Space Needle and all those museums next to it. And yes, you literally do wake up under the Space Needle, provided you have the blinds open in the main bedroom.

The place feels really homey, I didn't feel any pressure staying here other than disturbing neighbors  - which is properly a legit concern since this place is within an apartment complex so you probably shouldn't plan to party 'til 3 in the morning.

The host was nice enough to have pastries for four ready in the kitchen, with a Keurig coffee machine and coffee packs available so our breakfast was set already.

The parking was really tight, but for $5 a night literally next door to the apartment complex it's a good deal.

The only complaint I have is that you will be living in the Queen Anne district. I don't know much about this area, but it's quite lively and you will hear lots of pedestrians traffic until really late at night. And even after that, you might still hear strange music and noise in the air after midnight. For my last night staying there (it was a Friday), I started hearing marching band music (no kidding) right across the street. It didn't last very long, but it's long enough that you will probably get awaken by that (mind you I have all the windows closed as well). I didn't find that a deal breaker for this location, but for some light sleepers out there you might want to be wary of that."
1071843,18058179,2014-08-21,16397401,Joselyn,"Perfect neighborhood for our family.  We stayed for four nights, our kids spent everyday at the fountain.  Great location for public transportation.  You can't get a better location closer to the Seattle Center.  The bedroom was a bit noisy from the city streets since I am a light sleeper I slept in the living room and was just fine."
1071843,18539451,2014-08-28,17693258,Charlene,"Serina was a terrific host --- she responded immediately to our questions and was very available. The apartment was absolutely perfect for me and my (grown up) daughter --- extremely well appointed with a lot of extras to make us feel comfortable, clean, roomy, and in a great location. Even though the days were hot, the apt stayed quite cool and breezy.  Waking up the a view of the Space Needle was special!  We were close to the Sculpture Park, Seattle Center/Monorail, good coffee shop (Uptown Espresso --- great as Serina said it would be).  Pike Place is about a mile --- not a bad walk, but buses are also available (we did not use them). We didn't cook, but the kitchen is awesome and if you love the idea of getting market goods from Pike Place and cooking, you would be happy here.  We did use the washer, which was great. We got to a Mariner's game easily by taking the monorail and light rail.  If you are a morning person, you can get a discounted, early entry ticket to go up the Space Needle without the crowds --- it's so close --- and so is the Chihuly Glass Garden.  We packed a lot of fun into 3 days.  We did not explore the neighborhood up toward Queen Anne, except for coffee, but it looked interesting.  We'll definitely be going back to this place."
1071843,18652299,2014-08-30,5276139,Katharina,"Great place, spectacular view, Good Location to walk to Public Market on Pike - we had an really nice time in Seattle - would defibitely recommend the place! Serina was extremely responsive and accomodating - although we did not meet her all went perfectly! Thanks..."
1071843,18876634,2014-09-02,1852365,Carissa,"We didn't get the pleasure of meeting Serina but we were in a rush to head to the festival we were in town for.  
We loved staying here.  It was just what we needed for our weekend.  Looking forward to having her host us again next year."
1071843,19207784,2014-09-08,19194186,Nikki,"Serina was a wonderful host.  Although we never met Serina in person, she was readily available via text or phone.  The view of the space needle from the bedroom was beautiful.  We were able to walk everywhere from the apartment including the Pike Place Market, which we visited daily.  A little noisy at night, but we slept well regardless.          "
1071843,19379829,2014-09-11,17407385,Christopher,"Serina's apartment is great - spacious, airy and full of character.  We especially enjoyed waking up to the view of the Space Needle,which is only a very short stroll away.  We self catered one evening and found the kitchen - especially the cooking facilities - excellent; the oven seems to be almost brand new.  And the welcome pastries were great!  Sadly we could only stay a couple of nights, but would recommend the apartment for any stay in Seattle."
1071843,19508810,2014-09-14,9682540,Pamela,Serina has been a perfect host... We had everything that we needed ! The Description was exactly and Location easy to find! 
1071843,19792072,2014-09-18,20532566,Marie,"My first time using Airbnb and it was....A GREAT STAY! The apartment was just as it is pictured - clean, bright and airy.  The only noise we heard was from the buses driving past - which do run all night.  However, if we were watching tv, talking or asleep, neither of us heard the noise.  The neighborhood is otherwise quiet and appeared safe.  Close walk to the Space Needle area and we easily used Uber services while there.  Beds were comfortable and although we didn't cook - all the necessities were there.  Would recommend and stay again!  "
1071843,19936187,2014-09-21,16258095,Jenna,"My stay was excellent! It was extremely close to the Space Needle (8 minute walk) and was a quick drive to downtown Seattle. I've never been before and felt very safe in the neighborhood, Queen Anne is very adorable. The place was described just as I expected and Serina even left me some Kuerig coffee and pastries. I highly recommend staying here. "
1071843,20149588,2014-09-24,20330476,Kristen,"Great location, close enough to walk everywhere, if you like walking, otherwise close to public transportation.  Very comfortable apartment.   Serina welcomes you with pastries.  She also accommodated my need to drop my luggage off early, which was great.  Would stay there again.   

Other people commented on the noise of the neighborhood.  Yes, there was street noise but you are staying in a busy city and thus you're going to get street noise.  It wasn't loud enough to wake me up and I'm used to living in a very quiet suburb.   "
1071843,20570845,2014-10-01,11517749,Lauren,"Nice place to stay with an amazing view! The apartment was clean and comfortable and is within a short walking distance to major attractions including the space needle as well as restaurants and is close to the water.  It has all the amenities of a hotel like coffee, internet and TV but at half the price.  Serina was a great host and made sure to let us know she was there to help with any questions or issues should they occur (we did not have any issues) and was easily reachable by email.  "
1071843,21832555,2014-10-25,1001726,Debra,"Serina, as always, is a wonderful, gracious host. She's more than willing to help in nearly any situation.

The space continues to be the one we go back to when we visit Seattle."
1071843,22075568,2014-10-29,22215530,Rich,I was welcomed with Pastries which was a great treat after being on a plane all day. Serina was great and went out of her way to ensure your stay was a great stay. 
1071843,22186407,2014-11-01,19077139,Bryan,"This apartment was exactly what we wanted, and more than we could have hoped for! It is centrally located and you can walk to TONS of great places. Not to mention the breathtaking views of the Spaceneedle! Serena was very accomodating and had everything picture perfect when we arrived. We would highly recommend and will be coming back!"
1071843,22890568,2014-11-17,1924704,Jonathan,"We arrived to a very clean, well organized apartment with two delicious pastries on the kitchen counter. Serina was also very consistent and thorough with communicating her expectations as a host and how we should go about finding the unit.

We came in late Friday night, but we met Serina Saturday afternoon. She was very welcoming and friendly.

The kitchen is fully stocked and the apartment is in excellent proximity to the space needle (2-3 blocks) and many other attractions.

Serina also offers the best parking that we saw while we were in Seattle!

Since we came during a very cold time of the year, the apartment took a few hours to warm up. Not a complaint, just something to be mindful of, if you are visiting during the winter months."
1071843,23168900,2014-11-24,22930063,Bre,"The space was FANTASTIC!
We loved everything about it. Would definitely stay there again. Looks just like the photos. 
When we arrived, there was fresh baked goodies, how sweet :)"
1071843,24091125,2014-12-19,2469622,Thomas,"The apartment was very clean and looked as it did in the photos. My front unit (apt 9) had a direct view of the Space Needle. There were no problems during my stay.

The apartment included a big flatscreen TV with DVD player, WiFi, and a clock radio with iPod socket. I had no trouble logging in to the WiFi. The clock radio didn't get AM, only FM, and the alarm was difficult to set at first, but I eventually figured it out.

The washer/dryer combo is the kind used in apartments (small and takes a long time to dry) but if sufficed for my needs (just one person). The kitchen and bathroom were both clean. Serina seems to hire a professional maid to clean the units between guests.

I met Serina (she lives in another apartment in the same building) and she provided me with additional amenities when I requested them (detergent, garbage bags)."
1071843,24415252,2014-12-28,10620421,Jared,Everything during our stay was great. The location was perfect to easily get downtown or further uptown. We could walk to Queen Anne   and easily access stores. Having an awesome view of the Space Needle was definitely a bonus. Everything was clean and in working order while we stayed and Serina was easy to contact with questions. Also the parking space was convenient.
1071843,25091506,2015-01-06,22220180,Katelyn,Serina was a perfect host! The apartment was in a great location with a perfect kitchen and very comfortable sleeping arrangements. Would definitely stay there again!
1071843,25358890,2015-01-13,24704068,Jason,"The apartment was super cute and very comfortable.  the view of the space needle from the bedroom was spectacular as well.  Serina was a lifesaver for being around at the time of our arrival- we had a bit of trouble finding the correct apt and she came to let us in.  She's very sweet and takes great care of her place.   This is an excellent location to explore Seattle from.  

If you're driving, you should consider paying the extra $5/day with Serina for her parking space.  Street parking can be around $4-5 per 4 hours and there's a 4hr limit on all street parking in that area from 8am-8pm.  Street parking is free after that though!

Only complaint really was the noise level from the bedroom.  We live in NYC and even by those standards, we were still waking up to cars/buses/trucks whooshing by at 7:00am.  Thankfully Seattleites are more civilized and do not use car horns.
"
1071843,25557614,2015-01-19,23501352,Hanjue,Awesome house!
1071843,25760011,2015-01-25,862835,Colleen,"It was all accurate as listed. The apartment was very clean and she left pastries for us. The beds were ready and the place is in a fine location.
Serina is a great host and keeps good communication, and has all the essentials for you in the apartment!!!!
She thinks of everything from coffee to shampoo and has 2 comfy queen beds!
We enjoyed our stay and recommend the apartment!"
1071843,26078582,2015-02-02,5575176,Jaimie,The location is great - very close to everything you would want to walk to in Seattle. The apartment was nice and had all amenities you would require.
1071843,26263564,2015-02-08,26434540,Eleanor,Serina was a great hostess! The house was clean upon arrival and convenient to anything you want to do in Seattle. She was quick to respond with our questions and let us have the space to ourselves which I really appreciated. I would definitely come back and stay here! Highly recommended!
1071843,26482369,2015-02-14,1001726,Debra,Our short stay went very well. Our host provides every thing you need. I love the special touches like the pastries she leaves for your arrival.
1071843,26601986,2015-02-16,11528048,Melanie & David,"This was an excellent find! The apartment was even better than described, and Serina was really easy to work with and really responsive. The neighborhood was fantastic--we parked our car and didn't use it again until we left. We will definitely stay here again!"
1071843,26866908,2015-02-21,8021854,Anne,"Everything was well organized, clean and ready for us when we arrived.  Instructions were very explicit and helpful. We enjoyed the stay very much. Serina was responsive and available."
1071843,27219862,2015-02-28,27436356,Aimee,"Our experience was wonderful.  The place was  clean, neat and comfortable.  Location was awesome and easy walk to Pike Market, downtown and Seattle Center.  "
1071843,27652844,2015-03-09,26763872,Steve,What a delightful place to stay.  The location is amazing...just a block from the Key arena (where we planned to spend much of our time) and also an easy walk to the Space Needle and the Monorail which we took to downtown Seattle.  We will definitely come back!
1071843,27928150,2015-03-15,1475741,Sam,"Serina was an excellent host. We had an early flight which was hours before the check in time and Serina gave us the option to drop our luggage off if we needed. We were unable to take her up on this, but to have the option available was very nice. Serina also left us fresh pastries which was an absolute delight. We didn't have a lot of time to actually meet Serina as we were both out at Job interviews and Apartment hunting, but I'm sure from her warm gestures she is a lovely person. The place was exactly as listed and very nice. Walking distance to everything."
1071843,28216976,2015-03-20,26373090,Kim,Serina was a very kind host and the property was VERY clean and welcoming. The location was excellent. I highly recommend staying here. 
1071843,28313365,2015-03-22,16929702,Tina,"Very clean, comfortable apartment. Just as described. The parking was super convenient, and the coffee and pastries were a great touch. The little things make this place great!"
1071843,28516978,2015-03-25,26273984,Elizabeth,"Serina was a fantastic host, she greeted us right at check-in.  The apartment was super clean and well appointed.  Location is grand, right under the Space Needle.  We walked to a ton of little restaurants, the Seattle Center museums, and Pike's Place Market.  Never had to use our car once.  We had parking, wifi and Dick's Burgers.  Wonderful."
1071843,29022924,2015-04-02,6135849,Vanessa,"The location was outstanding and within walking distance of grocery stores, fine restaurants and local attractions. Parking was also very easy and we found parking directly outside the apartment each time we needed it.

Serina was a fabulous host. Her instructions were clear, the apartment was exceptionally clean and she even left pastries out for us the night we arrived! 

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place be on the top of your list for a Seattle stay."
1071843,30295898,2015-04-20,28350484,Sarah,We LOVED our stay in Serina's apartment. The location was absolutely great. You are less than 10 min from the Space Needle and everything else that the Seattle Center has to offer. The monorail is right there too and that is a quick 2 minute ride to Westlake. There is a duck tour that leaves from the Seattle Center which is highly recommended. Serina is very thoughtful and leaves wonderful pastries for your first night (we saved them for breakfast!). The bed was comfortable and you can't beat having the Space Needle right outside your window! You are a $6 Uber right to Pike Street which was really great too. It was such a great place and would stay there again!
1071843,31697254,2015-05-09,26620876,Minjin,"I love this house, we saw space niddle though bedroom's window every days and location is perfact by walk(15~20min)!!! You dont need to take personal stuffs because this house has everything. It was happy to stay during my  vacation. (Serena is excellent host!!!)"
1071843,32055594,2015-05-13,17693258,Charlene,"This is our second stay here, and we came back because we feel this is our perfect Seattle getaway.  The apartment was totally clean, neat, and ready for us. The decor is really nice, and we feel very comfortable here --- spacious enough, but still cozy.  Serina left us fresh baked goods and coffee for the Keurig, and she is always available for any questions (of which we had only a few).  There are good restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  The Chihuly Glass Garden, and all else that the park around the Space Needle has to offer, is so close, as well as the Sculpture Park.  The walk is to Pike Place Market or Westlake Center is not bad, but there is also good bus/monorail service to almost anywhere.  Last time we discovered the well equipped kitchen so this time we got fresh fish and veggies from the market and cooked some nights. Wifi worked well.  And honestly, though this sounds corny, we love looking out at the Space Needle!  I know we will be back!"
1071843,32169760,2015-05-15,22901666,Ally,"Fab apartment! One of the nicest I've stayed in via air b&b. Great location, loads to see an do nearby - highly recommended. Serina was great host. She went the extra mile on serval occasions to make my stay the best it could be - thank you Serina!!"
1071843,32363363,2015-05-17,30878791,Glara,Serina was super accommodating with our earlier check in time and was very responsive to any questions or requests we had prior to our arrival. Overall a great place to stay at a central location!
1071843,32680062,2015-05-20,28561558,Carol,"Serina's apartment was immaculate and well-located.  Pastries were waiting for us when we arrived for breakfast, as well a complete manual listing sights, dining, entertainment, etc. around town.  Kitchen was well-stocked, beds were comfortable.   She over-looked nothing.  "
1071843,33432443,2015-05-28,28908840,Alexander,Highly recommended! Nice appartment in a perfect location. Thank you Serina!
1071843,33771739,2015-06-01,10534820,Kay,"This apartment was the perfect spot for a business/pleasure trip to Seattle. It had everything I needed to stay connected (wifi and a comfy table to work from) when I needed to work and was centrally located for my partner to explore the city from while I worked. It's very tastefully decorated and has everything you need to eat in if you so desire. The fruit, coffee, and cream Serina left for us at check-in were greatly appreciated. "
1071843,34049187,2015-06-04,4835307,Mike,"The apartment was exactly as described, the bedroom window looked out directly at the Space Needle! Serina met us when we checked in a little bit early and showed us around the place and answered all of our questions."
1071843,34283173,2015-06-07,29243013,Sawyer,The apartment was awesome! So clean and well-kept! Everything we could ever think of needing was provided and Serina was willing to help with anything we needed. We would stay here again 100%.
1071843,34691374,2015-06-11,26357313,Paula,"We got there, we were a little lost..and tired after a long day because our fly was delayed for hours - but Serina was there waiting for us with all the information that we needed and with a nice plate with cheese and crackers which we enjoyed a lot!!!"
1071843,35060923,2015-06-15,12653664,Karen,"My stay at Serina's place was fantastic! I arrived to town a bit earlier than check in and was able to drop off my luggage ahead of time. Very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and just like others said, the view of the Space Needle was so awesome! The location was great too - walking distance to many of the popular spots around town. Would highly recommend this place!"
1071843,35369367,2015-06-18,15255319,Kim,Had a great stay with Serina. Location is great. We walked to everything. Serina was there to greet us and our place was ready for us. I would definitely stay again if I return to Seattle. 
1071843,35631909,2015-06-21,23311264,Gregory,"My partner and I stayed in Serina's lovely Seattle apartment while we were in the area for a wedding. Upon our arrival, Serina met us at our door and showed us into our apartment. Serina was very friendly during our brief visit. She asked if we needed anything before she left and reminded us that she was in the same building if anything came up.  She also provided some delicious pastries from a local bakery as a small token of appreciation.  Our stay was fantastic and we greatly enjoyed the apartment. Serina has all the basic amenities that a guest could need, including silverware, ice trays, an ironing board and iron, and basic toiletries. The apartment was centrally located for what we had planned during our time in Seattle.  Both my partner and I greatly enjoyed our stay and we would readily stay with Serina again next time we're in the area."
1071843,36169193,2015-06-26,6012084,Jacquelyn,This was my second stay with Serina. Once again we had a lovely experience. Her place is very clean with a great atmosphere. We arrived to a box of sweet pastries and on a very hot day the place had been cooled down with windows open and fans on. The location is amazing and parking was easy every time. It has a combo lock so you don't need meet up with Serina to get in. That makes it even more convenient. I would highly recommend any of Serina's places. We had a very good experience and hope to return next year.
1071843,36662798,2015-06-30,19241224,Alvin,Clean and well kept apartment thanks!
1071843,36860418,2015-07-02,12474970,Jessie,Great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. 
1071843,37133169,2015-07-05,26913615,Simona,This apartment was very cute and clean. The location was great and walking distance to the Seattle Center and more. Serina was very helpful and responsive to text and email. I would definitely recommend to people. 
1071843,37552200,2015-07-08,29814873,Erika,"The apartment was very cute, it had everything we needed. Serina was very nice and even left fresh pastries! The location was perfect, we walked everywhere. Would definitely recommend!"
1071843,37862583,2015-07-11,34278562,Allan,This lovely 1 bedroom apartment was the perfect home-base to exploring Seattle. Literally minutes from the Needle and about a 20- minute walk to Pike's Place market you couldn't ask for a better location. The apartment had everything you need and was ideal for a couple or two people with a comfy fold out bed in the living room. Serina was very helpful and available whenever needed.
1071843,38261150,2015-07-14,26950078,Tara,My parents stayed here as well as my sister. They really liked Serina and the apartment was really nice. They said it was very comfortable and in a great location. They would highly recommend the place. They said Serina was very helpful and nice.
1071843,38693713,2015-07-18,1982663,Benjamin,Perfect stay! Literally under the Space needle. Great location and perfect host! Communication was easy and we were able to check out a little bit later. Great Airbnb expérience :-)
1071843,39262492,2015-07-22,3371786,Paul,"Absolutely perfect location! My wife and I came for a long weekend and enjoyed our stay at Serina's place. Everything was within walking distance. The apartment was comfortable and had everything we needed. Also a great view of the Space Needle.
The restaurant suggestions were great, especially Toulouse Petit.
Serina was quick to respond to any questions we had before our trip. 
Should we return to Seattle, we would definitely stay at Serina's place."
1071843,39902536,2015-07-27,27369505,Dylan,"Stayed with my Dad for four nights while in town for baseball. Location was excellent. Fifteen minute walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP). There wasn't one moment when we felt unsafe in the apartment. 

One problem with the location was the noise at night. It was fine on the weekends but on Thursday night it took a while to get to sleep. No problem at all if you're a heavy sleeper, though."
1071843,40211133,2015-07-29,16315207,Nicole,"My parents stayed at Serina's place for a two day trip to Seattle. Great location, the house was easily reachable by bus and it was in walking distance to the space needle. My parents very much enjoyed their stay, Serina's place was clean and tidy and had everything they needed. Thanks for a great experience! "
1071843,41186429,2015-08-05,24912700,David,"This was a great place to stay. Right in downtown Seattle. Plenty of places to visit just in walking distance, and if it's a little further, there's a bus stop close by to get you to places like Pike Place Market. Serina was very welcoming and even left pastries from a local shop when we arrived. You can't get much closer to the Seattle Center than this. Parking in the spaces at the apartment is a little small, but it is the cheapest compared to downtown parking. 
Definitely consider this place if you will be staying downtown."
1071843,41578485,2015-08-08,29280410,Cecile,"Serena provided everything one could ask for. The location was perfect and I was able to walk to activities. The Mono rail is just a stone's throw away so I was able to go to Pike's market quite easily.Finally,I would recommend this place to anyone. One important point, the apartment was spotless.
Thank you Serina!"
1071843,42247016,2015-08-12,23987856,Daniel,"This was an excellent place for a father and son to stay for a 4-night vacation in Seattle. Very conveniently located for walking and talking public transit around the city. Did not actually meet Serina, but she was always easily accessible through the app. The sheets for the futon were missing at check-in, but as soon as I asked about it, she apologized, and brought them up, even making the bed!! She was very welcoming and the apartment was well appointed with everything you could need, and more. Detergent was provided for both the dishwasher and the washing machine. The welcome gift of fresh fruit and cold water bottles in the fridge was a very nice touch. Thanks!"
1071843,43216559,2015-08-18,30283128,Christian,"The apartment was perfect for us. It started with the great view of the Space Needle right from the bedroom window. It was in walking distance, as were the harbor and Pike Place Market. It was very clean and we had everything we needed. Serina even picked up some fresh fruit for us, which was very nice. We never met her, but she sure did a good job. "
1071843,43473652,2015-08-20,27406522,Charlotte,"There was a bowl of fruit let for us that was great, Serina also has a lovely list of recommended places in the neighborhood."
1071843,43753653,2015-08-22,30598112,Yachira,"Close to great tourists attractions and eats. Super close walking distance to the Space Needle and the Monotrain which took us to Downtown, Portland. Very comfy clean apartment. Love access to wash and dry. The neighborhood was quiet and just lovely. Serina was great too. She made us feel welcomed and even gifted us with delicious pastries. Will definitely love to stay again!  "
1071843,44403111,2015-08-26,27829200,Kaori,"Serina was very nice and helpful to accommodate our requests. Apartment was very neat and clean and had everything we needed for our 4 nights stay. Despite it's convenient location our room was very quiet. 
My husband I visit Seattle every year and we are very happy to find a place we can come  back to stay each year."
1071843,44883094,2015-08-30,26964741,Jenny,"Great neighborhood, very short mile walk to Pike Place, very clean and she welcomed us with pastries. Very easy with the keypad for entry!"
1071843,45240962,2015-09-01,3535241,Nikki,"Serina made us feel very welcome. The place is absolutely lovely and very comfortable. The apartment is very well appointed for cooking if you get overwhelmed by all the great restaurants, or just want to heat up some fresh crab cakes and veggies from Pike Place. It's in a fabulous location, truly right under the Space Needle. Our 3 year old loved to say good night and good morning to the Space Needle. We would definitely stay here again."
1071843,45649465,2015-09-05,27074230,Greg,"Serina's large and very comfortable apartment was perfect for us, it was handy to the bus network and walking distance to the Space Needle and a little further to the Pike markets.
The apartment is clean and well appointed. We wished we could have had an extra few days.
Serina provided us with lots of good information on how to get to the apartment, about the local  area and how the get to the Museum of Flight.  
We  enjoyed our stay.
"
1071843,45922464,2015-09-07,11201589,Jane,This is a great apartment and very close to the Space Center. It's walkable to downtown or there are plenty of transport options nearby including the monorail. Bumbershoot was on the weekend we stayed and it was still pretty quiet. The apartment itself has everything you'll need and is very comfortable. 
1071843,46290717,2015-09-09,30665119,Kelsey,"We loved our stay with Serina! The place was just as she described it with all the comforts of home, including a full kitchen with pots and pans and cookware, a stocked Kuerig, and even rubbing alcohol and a first-aid kit which I needed because I banged my leg up not long after arriving in Seattle. The pastries she left us were amazing, as well! And the bed-oh my word, my husband and I keep talking about how amazing it was! I wish Serina had properties all over the country so we could always stay with her. The apt. is also very conveniently located- we walked everywhere we went and never had to move the car. Can't say enough about it!"
1071843,46514922,2015-09-11,4605775,Maria,Perfect Seattle rental!   Clean and comfy and within walking distance to everything!
1071843,47029612,2015-09-15,618932,Jackie,What a great place! We were shocked by how nice this place was and Serina anticipated all of our needs - everything we needed was there. Location was great and the view of the Space Needle from the bedroom was awesome. I would definitely recommend this apartment!
1071843,48070156,2015-09-23,2626036,Heiko,"It was our first Airbnb-Experience - and it was even better than we expected.
Everything worked fine in communication with Serina. The house is perfectly located within walking distance to the space needle, public transport within a nice neighborhood.
The apartment has plenty of space, everything was clean and in good condition. And there was even a washing machine with dryer in our apartment, which was very handy for us.
Thank you Serina!"
1071843,48862335,2015-09-29,31997637,Mary,Great location.  Clean place.
1071843,49307506,2015-10-03,29585440,Sandra,"We had the most comfortable time! It was all well prepared as we arrived and the apartment is even bigger than it seems on the photos. We totally loved the cozy style and the cleanliness. The modern kitchen had everything we could imagine, and the view from the bedroom to Space needle was priceless. A lot of places of interest and the Monorail are reachable by foot and the neighborhood is quite nice as well. We also had the chance to meet Serina, what was really a pleasure as she is such a lovely person. "
1071843,49612511,2015-10-05,40530273,Freya,"Fantastic location, easy walking to Seattle Centre, waterfront and Pike Place. Lots to do within walking distance including good restaurants and supermarkets. Serina was an excellent host, quick to respond to any questions and welcomed us when we arrived."
1071843,50424581,2015-10-12,28474891,Toshihide,"到着時間の連絡が遅れ留守電への連絡となったにもかかわらず、アパートへの到着時待っていてくれたこと。

事前に貰った案内情報が正確でほぼ迷わず自力で到達できた。　滞在中の生活にも役立った。"
1071843,50855781,2015-10-15,4398697,Jillian,"Serina was a wonderful host in every way!  She even left a treat for when I check-in.  Easy to communicate with.  The location was unbelievable, and the apartment was lovely.  Would highly recommend this spot to anybody looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
1071843,51268552,2015-10-19,37100166,Ashika,Serina's apartment was great! It had everything we needed and was a good base for our stay in Seattle. Check-in and check-out were both very easy and the baked goods from Serina was a nice gesture and very much appreciated. I would happily recommend staying here.
1071843,51727599,2015-10-24,22027921,Quanice,"Amazing apartment. I felt like I lived in Seattle. Seeing was a great host and made herself available if I had any needs or questions. If I come back to Seattle, I'll definitely stay here again!"

1071843,53119419,2015-11-05,13270859,Lyra,"Serina maintained great communication leading up to our stay.  However, there was some sort of disconnect when we went to check in.  When we punched in our provided code, we received an error- and Serina was unreachable via cell phone/ email provided.  Luckily, we were able to reach out to AirBnb customer service and were provided with a room at a nearby hotel for the night.  Serina reached out later that night to apologize and explain the miscommunication.  It was a really unfortunate/inconvenient event- but I'm glad AirBnb was able to accommodate for us and Serina followed up with us.

We were booked for a three night stay, and after spending the first night at the hotel we returned back on the second day to check in.  The code was valid this time, and Serina came to greet us.  She had coffee cake and wine, which was a nice gesture.

Amenities were provided as mentioned: Washer/Dryer in one, Keurig with plenty of k-cups, full kitchen, and bluetooth speakers in both the bedroom and living room.  There was also a radiator system that kept the place nice and cozy.  Most convenient, was the location.  We were able to either walk or take a uber for a small cost to reach out points of interest."
1071843,53320636,2015-11-08,38306159,Gregory,This was such a lovely place. We loved being able to walk to the Seattle center and downtown or take the monorail into downtown. The place was nice and clean and the sweet Apple rolls that were left for us were such a nice gesture. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone and will stay here in future visits. 
1071843,53641166,2015-11-10,2892495,Amber,Serina provided some local pastries for breakfast which was a nice added touch for my family who stayed there. She was very responsive when I couldn't get the door open (due to my own error) and when we needed some help getting the tv & netflix working (for my not so tech-savvy fam). Unit is 2nd floor with about 25 steps up; wasn't a problem for me but could be for older folks. View from bedroom was gorgeous with space needle lighting up the sky!  Would definitely stay here again - very clean & there was a manual provided with info for the unit.

She made sure she answered any questions and responded to my specific questions about bus schedules and what bus I could take to my son's house.The apartment is very clean and contains everything we might need including coffee and shampoo.  There was a notebook with detailed info. about the neighborhood, how to operate the TV, etc.  The location was very convenient.  Everything we wanted was close or a short bus ride away.  The neighborhood felt very safe.  Loved the fresh basket of fruit!  "

Very easy for walking to the store, and museums, and easy bus transportation to downtown. Everything was set-up when we arrived, extremely clean, and welcoming! We walked around in the early evenings back from a full day out and felt safe doing so (being winter it was also dark by 430pm). Would definitely look up Serina again if we ever get back to Seattle! Thank You!"

Unit was clean and everything was in working order. The view from the bedroom is amazing! You have a clear view of the space needle. Serina is a great host. She responds very quickly & makes you feel right at home. You feel like she is available for any questions or things you may need. Definitely recommend staying here! I hope to visit again soon.

The bed in the apartment was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. My only complaint is the slower internet speed we experienced,  which was not too big of a deal since we were out and about most of the day. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and we would definitely stay here again. "

1264287,5471473,2013-07-01,6987580,Susie,"Absolutely wonderful--no complaints. Our family of 4 (with two young children under the age of 4) stayed for 4 nights for business and pleasure. Katharine is very responsive--we communicated by airbnb email, phone and text. 

The house is very spacious, clean and comfortable--it surpassed any hotel. It could easily accommodate a bigger group than ours. Our kids shared the main floor bunk room (one in the bottom bed and the other in the provided pack-and-play) while my husband and I slept in the room next to it; we didn't even need the two beds upstairs or the basement bathroom/bedroom. Great little backyard for airing out the kids. The only caveat is for very sound-sensitive people: because it's conveniently close to I-5, there's a muffled thrum of traffic.

Fantastic location. Near I-5 and UW, Wallingford is walkable and family-friendly. Michael had to work downtown, and it was an easy drive and bus ride from the house. The house is a block away from an elementary school playground, 10 blocks away from a city park with lovely play structure and wading pool. Also, an easy walk or very short drive to a grocery store, many restaurants, etc. Close to Gasworks, the Zoo, Green Lake, and so much more. 

We highly recommend this house, and we'll definitely be back!"
1264287,5586670,2013-07-07,6942623,John,"Very nice, clean, comfortable house in a good location.   Having 4 bedrooms was great, but was a bit of a challenge for us with 1 bathroom.   Somewhat limited kitchen cooking pots and pans. "
1264287,5735887,2013-07-14,6929744,Kimberly,"Katharine's house was very clean, spacious, and in a great location.  Our family of four (including two small children) enjoyed our stay. "
1264287,5867050,2013-07-20,6880277,Jaynie,"This house is in a great location, in a great walking neighborhood as well as near the Burke Gilman trail. The house is well equipped and comfortable. Our only complaint is the proximity to the freeway and the resulting ""white"" noise. Overall, I think the house is appropriately priced due to the location and lack of usable backyard and is a great value for the price. "
1264287,6131311,2013-07-31,6675632,Tim,Nice house with lots of character. We were well looked after whilst there. 
1264287,6708777,2013-08-22,66019,Roy,"Katharine's house in Wallingford, Seattle was perfect for us.  Clean and comfortable, convenient and surprisingly quiet, it has easy access to the freeway and is minutes from downtown.  Just a few blocks walk to Lake Union, it held everything we needed for our family gathering from North and South America. Katharine was so easy to communicate with, we would definitely stay here again!   Roy"
1264287,6868685,2013-08-28,7009887,Jon,"My family and I stayed for 6 nights.   We had a wonderful stay.  The house was clean and well kept.  The house is very large and great for large groups (we had 10 stay for 3 of nights because of a wedding).  Katharine was very responsive to anything we needed.  The neighborhood is very nice and close to downtown.  I would definitely recommend this house to anyone staying in Seattle, especially anyone with a large group.  Oh and the fact that there were plenty of baby items, made the stay that much better (we have an 8 month old). "
1264287,7035981,2013-09-04,993954,Erik,"I stayed in Katharine's house as part of a group of 6 while exhibiting at the PAX conference.  The house worked out great for us, with a good amount of space and a very convenient location."
1264287,7241840,2013-09-13,4880356,Jane,"Had a GREAT stay at Katharine's  - The house was clean and very comfortable - we had 8 of us staying there.  It was conveniently located for us - I-5 is nearby which will take you almost anywhere in the city - Wallingford is a cozy little community and there are parks and places to walk all around.  Stores and restaurants are not far either. There is only 1 bathroom, which isn't ideal but it was no problem making it work.  The only thing I would say is there is not much in the way of cooking implements when cooking for a large group.  There are some pots and pans - but a larger skillet and sauce pan would have been helpful to us. Katharine was easy to get in touch with when we needed her and she responded quickly.  I HIGHLY recommend these accommodations.  Mahalo!"
1264287,9598747,2014-01-03,2522428,Larry,"We enjoyed the house during our stay in Seattle. Good location, close to downtown, University District, etc. No negatives to relate."
1264287,9818080,2014-01-12,155139,Sara Scout,"Katharine's house was a perfect place for my colleagues and I to stay while collaborating with people at UW. The house was clean and comfortable (especially my bed, which seemed to have some sort of extra pad on top of mattress), minimally decorated, and quite convenient to the university (about a 20-min walk). The highway was a little noisy outside the house and when standing near the leaded windows (which have a single pane), but the neighborhood is otherwise very quiet and pleasant. "
1264287,10675919,2014-03-03,1459387,Nathan,"A group of us were visiting Seattle from Baltimore for a writers' conference, and this Wallingford 4 bedroom provided the perfect home base for us. The house was really nicely located relative to our conference site (the downtown convention center), and it was also near lots of other great stuff we were able to enjoy during our stay (restaurants, coffee shops, parks, etc.). Katharine was very gracious and accommodating in opening her home to us. We had a great visit, and a large part of that was thanks to where we were staying."
1264287,17737289,2014-08-17,12295046,Ankit,"The neighborhood and house is excellent. It is quiet, and right next to the highway so it is easy to get anywhere in Seattle pretty quickly. There are also plenty city-central bus stops located nearby. There are enough places to eat within walking distance too. The backyard is big and nice for grilling and hanging out, but could use some cleaning up.
Overall, the house is great. I would recommend it."
1264287,18563025,2014-08-28,19278738,Jennifer,"Our host was prompt on responding; important to our group.The house had a spacious feel in the main room and huge bedrooms, with good lighting and a well-stocked kitchen for our big group. Nice walking neighborhood.  We were very pleased on  seeing the house was actually as nice as represented by site photos."
1264287,18781964,2014-09-01,12809147,Renee,"The house was as advertised in a great location for us. One mile to Gas Works Park, quiet and quaint. The rooms were spacious and it was a nice space for children (twin bed, pack-n-play). One bathroom isn't ideal, but we made it work ok. Host was responsive- fixed light that was out in the kitchen on the 2nd day. Only issue was that I would make sure you understand Seattle's recycling policy regarding compostable items, etc, because it seems to be more strict than other cities. Also, there is only one mirror in the entire house (in the bathroom), which wasn't ideal when we were a family getting ready to be in a wedding."
1264287,19884763,2014-09-20,5340931,Dan,I stayed at Katharine's place with 3 collaborators when we were visiting UW for a conference. The place was perfect! It's in a great location and it's just as spotless and spacious as the photos make it seem. Katharine was a great host and she responded quickly to all of our questions. Highly recommended!
1264287,20594319,2014-10-01,10453087,Taylor,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1264287,24535127,2014-12-30,23531873,Rebecca,"Our family stayed here over Christmas 2014 and had a great time!  The house easily accommodates a group of 7 (we chose to pay for the second bathroom).  We were pleasantly surprised to find large pans available to cook a large meal and plenty of plates.  The location is excellent with all services (dry cleaning, drug store, market, shoe repair) and fun shops in easy walking distance.  Close to Burke Gilman trail for exercise and strolling and wonderful view of downtown Seattle.  Katharine met us upon arrival and was very warm and welcoming."
1264287,43893997,2015-08-23,21809077,Alex,Katharine was awesome. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and checked in with us during our stay. The house is great and we loved using the kitchen. The living space is perfect for hosting guests and the kitchen is fully stocked. Katharine Rocks!
1264287,45242560,2015-09-01,5977866,Charles,"Great neightborhood, shops and resturaunts were walking distance from the house. Close enough to down town that Uber's were at times less than $12.  The house was exactly as described. My group agreed that we would love to stay in this home again."
1264287,46118981,2015-09-08,6663598,Pat,"Fantastic location. You can quickly drive to just about everything Seattle has to offer very quickly. Tons of restaurants nearby by car, and some on foot, and you can get to the water on foot pretty quickly. We had plenty of privacy and we didn't lack for anything. "
1264287,47060544,2015-09-15,1745077,Anna,"We had a great stay in Katharine's house.  The house was clean, well appointed, and provided ample space that was well separated for different groups sharing the home.  The neighborhood is great  -  very good restaurants and easy access to the lake and all Seattle has to offer.  Katharine responded quickly to inquiries and was very easy to work with.  Recommended! "
1264287,47967537,2015-09-22,8551695,David,"Katharine was a great host, she went above-and-beyond in helping us get situated and comfortable. The neighborhood is great - safe and very close to major highway access. While that does mean a little road noise (not loud, just ""white noise""), it was worth the trade-off for us. 
It's not a brand new house with perfect finishes, but the price is great, and it includes all the basic amenities - washer/dryer, parking, fast internet, dishwasher, etc. If you have small kids, the house has most of what you'd need - high chair, pack'n'play, baby gate, toys, etc - a big bonus."
1264287,50460188,2015-10-12,16716063,Grace,"We had a wonderful time at Katharine's house!! The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were spacious and lovely. The kitchen was well stocked and we loved having breakfast in the little nook. There was plenty of space for 2 cars to park, and the house is within walking distance of several really cool areas. We had no problems with the cable, internet, or any appliances. Overall it was one of the most enjoyable Air BNB experiences! "
1264287,52603479,2015-10-31,44753470,Nicholas,"Katharine's home was perfect for our trip.  It is in a great location and had everything we needed to be comfortable.  There were clean towels available in both bathrooms, and the kitchen was stocked with all of the utensils that we needed.  The grocery store is very close and convenient.  The entrance to I5 is just a couple of blocks away to get anywhere we needed to go in the city.  Highly recommended."
1264287,55374323,2015-12-01,21330079,Hilary,This home is warm and cozy. All furniture and beds are very comfortable. Host went out of her way to answer questions. Proximity to Wallingford shops and restaurants is a definite plus. We enjoyed our stay!
1264287,56249873,2015-12-11,20398894,Ann,"Katharine was an excellent host; we enjoyed staying at her house very much! House was clean, well-stocked, and has a great location in Seattle.  We would recommend it and stay again!
"
1264287,57439194,2015-12-26,703441,Beth,"My family and I had a wonderful time! The house was exactly as described.  It was a great location close to many grocery stores and restaurants, there was plenty of room to spread out for the six of us, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed.  It was easy to work with Katharine on the logistics and details.  "
5859152,43868135,2015-08-22,41631274,Brandon,"Work keeps Alan pretty busy, so you'll likely have the run of the house most of the time. His absence isn't much of a concern given he has the energy of three people. Anything you need he will make sure is taken care of ASAP. The rooms he has available are clean, with comfortable beds. The kitchen, which is totally open for use, is amazing. I made several meals and enjoyed every second of cooking in a space designed to work well. I would not hesitate to recommend staying with Alan whenever they are in Seattle."
5859152,44479390,2015-08-26,2522761,Gigi,"Alan was a great host and was very helpful answering questions for us. Our stay was quite nice. The apartment is clean, charming and  well maintained. It was a quiet area with easy access to downtown by 10mins uber. Love it! "
5859152,44988132,2015-08-30,40323370,Shua,"Alan was a very accommodating host, asked us if we needed anything but also left us alone since everything was fine.  When we arrived, we found a clean room, clean bathroom, clean house.  Great kitchen!  It is updated and looks just like the photo.  We decided to use it to make our last dinner and it worked just fine.  Alan had all the kitchen utensils, pots and pans to make it possible to put a meal together.  The neighborhood is in a residential area, quiet and surrounded by bike and walking trails.  We stumbled upon a neighborhood garden one evening where a jazzy/orchestra-like band was playing.  We were treated to a free, neighborly outdoorsy concert!  Such a pleasant surprise!  We were close enough to downtown to hop on a bus and make it there in 25 mins or via a 10-15 mins drive.  Overall, a great experience staying at Alan's place.  "
5859152,45182514,2015-08-31,42057871,Robel,"My experience staying with Alan was incredibly pleasant. I found him to be kind, flexible and hospitable. My room was clean and comfortable. I highly recommend staying at Alan's place if you're visiting the Seattle area. 

"
5859152,45842624,2015-09-06,41729440,Jan,"Alan was an amazing host! He made sure I had everything I needed (even provided me with toothbrush and tooth paste, which was because I forgot mine lol). Though he was wasn't there all the time, he was just a text away! Thank you for letting me stay there Alan, it was truly a pleasure!"
5859152,46184607,2015-09-08,3565014,Chalermpan,"Alan's place is very nice, clean, and quiet  at night. Well I been out all day only for bath and bed. Alan arranged my early check in very impressed. My life in Seattle much more easy. "
5859152,46525926,2015-09-11,42381916,Miriam,Alan was a great host! Very friendly and accommodating. The room was great and set up when we arrived. Would recommend.
5859152,47079507,2015-09-15,14480040,James,We didn't have a lot of interaction with the host. The place was described fairly accurately and the neighborhood was fine. It worked for us. 
5859152,48197192,2015-09-24,39949458,Alwynne,"This was my first Airbnb experience, so was a bit nervous about it. I was pleased at the ease of access to the house and the openness to kitchen and living areas. Kitchen was a great meeting place to meet other house guests, and well equipped for cooking. My travelling companion and I were sorry not to meet Alan who was out of town. Nevertheless, all went well and other housemates helped with orientation. Location was pleasant with nearby park and easy access to downtown with either bus or car. We really enjoyed our four nights there and would recommend to others. "
5859152,48444960,2015-09-26,43902582,Amber,"Clean, charming home in residential neighborhood close to freeways for quick travel but quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep after a day of adventuring in Seattle. "
5859152,49812943,2015-10-06,43516396,Grace,Loved my stay at Alan's house! Everything was clean and the house smelled good. It was my first time to try Airbnb so I was kinda worried but it turned out great. Everything was one or two bus rides away. And when I got lazy an Uber ride is 8-10$ to and from downtown.  I also loved running around the area. Wanted to go to madrona park but didn't have the time. I was usually out the whole day in downtown and I went to the gym in Capitol Hill at night so I haven't really seen much of Alan but he is a great host! Would definitely recommend! 
5859152,50118662,2015-10-09,14404018,Anjila,"I really appreciated how Alan made sure that I was taken care of. he even made special arrangements for me to check in a little early which was very helpful for my schedule.
The neighborhood was very nice and the fall colors were beautiful. 
The bed was very comfortable! And the room was big and I had plenty of room for my luggage. 
Alan the house was very neat and clean and livable. I enjoyed my stay! thanks!  "
5859152,50251077,2015-10-10,21457215,HanMee,"Alan wasn't at home when I arrived but he provided entry instructions which was great. The space is as described, newly remodeled and very clean. I loved that there was a little collection of books under the side table; I actually started reading one of them and will probably end up buying one myself."
5859152,53327398,2015-11-08,3590996,Francis,"I had a great month stay at Alan's place. Everything was as described on the page. I really appreciated the storage space for food and appliances and freedom to utilize everything in the house. We didn't see each other much because of our schedules, but it was really a comfortable experience that I really have no complaints about."
5859152,54046429,2015-11-15,13192085,Leanna,"Alan was very accommodating with my last minute booking and my ever-changing arrival schedule.  Though we didn't have much time to interact, he was friendly and showed me around.  The house was extremely clean and quiet.  Though there are a few roommates living in the house, they are all young working professionals and seemed to keep quietly to themselves.  Coming from a week-long conference, I was exhausted so it was nice to have a quiet space to just relax on my own.  The neighborhood was nice, with a park next door.  I also appreciated that there were some breakfast bars out in the kitchen for guests...came in handy when I woke up starving!"
7651148,41868550,2015-08-09,39183164,Chris,Chelsi and Jeremy were amazing hosts. I spent a week with them and they were very accommodating. They were able to setup for me with one day notice and even supply complimentary medication when I got sick for a day. Jeremy is an amazing chef that made a perfect 5 course mean for me the first night I stayed and perfect breakfasts. Chelsi was always looking out for any of my needs and ensuring my stay with them felt like home. There place is amazing with tons of unique objects that come with endless conversations. The beds are as good as they describe them and in such a cozy place you wont want to leave. Highly recommend staying here!
7651148,42470936,2015-08-13,29965258,Crystal,"I stayed in the ""Student"" room for two nights while in West Seattle for business. It was a GREAT location with several restaurants and a gas station within a block.

This is an awesome place! Chelsi and Jeremy are very kind and giving...even in the ""student"" room which I had. Just don't get in the way or distract him when Jeremy is cooking! It is a very intense process as he prepares complex meals that need his entire focus.

They have a cabinet of complimentary gatorade and juice by the door which everyone is welcome to grab. The beds are SUPER comfy and the towels are top quality. 

Three rooms share a full bathroom but I never had a problem because I was showering at night.

As you would expect from a chef, the ingredients of all meals are top notch and mostly local. The complimentary breakfast is extensive covering more than just cereal! There is also oatmeal, bagels, English muffins, juice, etc. The coffee is great and milk and sugar are provided a plenty. 

If you can afford it book a breakfast or a dinner there at least once. You WONT be disappointed. Jeremy even accommodated my early work schedule and made sure I had my breakfast first. 

Sometimes it can get intense when meals are being prepared. One morning I felt like I was in an episode of Hell's Kitchen! But the mood lightened quickly and the meal was excellent. 

I'm not a ""smoker"" and was never bothered by overwhelming smells or anything like that. I just wanted a more memorable experience than a standard hotel. Jeremy and Chelsi and the other guests all had great stories to tell and looking at all the memorabilia was fun. My first night I stayed up way to late just chatting with all the interesting people from around the world.  

I would certainly stay there again if I find myself in the area."
7651148,43142864,2015-08-17,40448055,Karen,"This is truly a home away from home!  Jeremy and Chelsi make you feel so welcome, the beds are ohsosoft and the meals .... well I don't want to spoil all the wonderful surprises.  My #1 place to stay when in Seattle - I always want to keep these gems to myself but that's not fair to all the other travelers waiting to experience everything that is  Seattle!  "
7651148,44853502,2015-08-29,41631274,Brandon,Chelsi and Jeremy were great hosts. Everything you would expect given where you're choosing to stay. Be a grown up yourself and you will never have more fun.
7651148,45623383,2015-09-04,8493147,Brad,"The room and hospitality goes above and beyond any other airbnb experience I've had. The rooms are exactly as pictured, the beds are incredibly comfortable and the hosts are a pleasure to get to know. Be an adult and enjoy all that the place and hosts have to offer. I look forward to staying here again."
7651148,45915864,2015-09-06,36157488,Robert,This is a very clean home owned by a very kind and courteous host.  I would recommend this to a friend and will stay this Chelsi again when I'm in Seattle.  
7651148,46557638,2015-09-11,8493147,Brad,My stay was a pleasure as usual. Chelsi is as hospitable and friendly as it gets. Beds are very comfortable. Will stay again. 
7651148,47099391,2015-09-15,24428572,Ara,"Thank you to both Chelsi and Chef Jeremy! I had an extremely pleasant stay and was greeted every morning with a hot delicious breakfast. Both Chelsi and Jeremy went out of their way to make me feel welcome and at home throughout my stay. The room was very comfortable and even had a big desk, which I was able to work from. Chef Jeremy even made me a surprise lunch when he saw that I was busy working all day. I would love to stay here again!"
7651148,47277816,2015-09-17,19544441,Amy,"This was one of the first times I rented a room instead of the renting the whole place and it was a great surprise. The company and conversation were great and the whole trip was very relaxing even though I was in town for work. I appreciated the excellent breakfast, good coffee and amazing cookies! Chelsi and Jeremy are amazing entrepreneurs and will be worth watching their success in the future! I cant wait til their next venture is up, so I can visit again. It was a pleasant surprise to get the history and chemical lesson on Cannabis"
7886656,44378550,2015-08-25,17972142,Claudia,"The appartment was really nice and had a great view of Seattle. It was very clean and cosy, just few minutes by car from downtown and Alki Beach. We felt very welcome right from the beginning. Joe and Alicia provided helpful advice of what to do in Seattle and were really nice and attentive hosts. @Joe and Alicia: Thanks again for everything. We miss your lovely appartment already! "
7886656,46045046,2015-09-07,21920444,Mathis,"My friends and I had a great stay at Joe's place for 1 night. The space is exactly as advertised. Very clean and comfortable! Joe was very welcoming and helpful. I was able to do some laundry in the morning before heading out while joe gave me recommendations for my road trip.
I would highly recommend staying here and I will probably be back myself."
7886656,46784415,2015-09-13,42695062,Jennifer, Joe and Alicia were wonderful.   They were extremely considerate and accommodating and their home was exactly as described/pictured.

7886656,47235924,2015-09-16,39538530,John,"This BNB is near perfect, ...no it is perfect.  Joe and Alicia were very welcoming and oriented us to the neighborhood and city.  The spacious apartment has been recently renovated - everything new and sparkling clean.  The view of the city is spectacular.  There are 2 bedrooms, a living space, and parking in back.   Within a block of walking there are a variety of great restaurants.  City was about a 10 minute drive. These hosts and this place are exceptional- highly recommended.  I will be back."
7886656,47895491,2015-09-21,4194061,Martha,"To all you airbnbers, don't mess up this place. We would like to be able to return whenever we want to get our Seattle fix. The apartment is immaculate, comfortable and quiet with a postcard view and easy access to Seattle.  On site  parking and a private entrance  made  it perfect. Within easy walking distance are many excellent restaurants: Bakery Nouveau  (everything ), Buddha Ruska ( garlic chicken, shrimp Pad Thai ), Fresh Bistro ( moules et frites, crab cakes, lamb burger). There is a nearby Safeway and important to all of us who live in the country, a Trader Joe within a few blocks. We had a great time renting bikes and cruising along Puget Sound at Alki Beach. 

Joe and Alicia were perfect hosts. They were welcoming, quick to respond to any inquiries and knowledgeable about the area. We could not have had a better experience."
7886656,50371685,2015-10-11,10454911,Tanya,"This Airbnb space was the nicest I've ever stayed in. The view is true to the pictures--you are high in a hill and can see the entire Seattle skyline and a beautiful row of houses across from you. The bedrooms and living room are spacious and clean. And the windows are huge! The drive into the city was about 15-20 min. We loved living in this beautiful home in a great location.

Alicia is very welcoming and flexible. She made our stay was convenient and fun."

7886656,52354151,2015-10-28,967037,Kecia,"Joe was very accommodating.  He communicated with me whenever I needed something.  His place was very clean and very new. The view of the city was amazing and the location fit our needs for our stay.  We loved the area and felt safe.  There are lots of restaurants, super markets, yoga and an organic restaurant down the corner that we loved going to. I definitely recommend the location, it reminded me of my home, Hawaii with their Island decor.  Thank you Joe!"
7886656,54605420,2015-11-22,866140,Karin And Bill,"Beautiful place! The views are gorgeous. Very clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. They even got us a French press so we didn't have to pack one. Conveniently located only a couple blocks to restaurants and shops. Quiet and safe neighborhood.   Joe and Alicia were great hosts. We didn't have time but would have loved to get to know them better. Highly recommend. We would be back. "
7886656,54961325,2015-11-25,17529077,Ryan,"Joe and Alicia were great; they even stayed up late to meet me on a weeknight after my flight was delayed! The listing is exactly as it appears in the pics, and the view is excellent!"
7886656,55136228,2015-11-28,14754708,Xiaochuan,"Thanksgiving is special time. Although Joe needs to take a vacation himself and away from home, he has arranged everything and make sure we have a good stay at his home. Very considerate host and sweet home!"
7886656,56996298,2015-12-20,7545762,Michael,"Our stay at our hosts' Air bnb home was wonderful . It was located in a terrific neighborhood for shopping, dining and exploring the local West Seattle vibe. The accommodations were excellent for our short stay. We felt welcomed and relaxed as we stayed in our hosts' home."
8094338,45229586,2015-08-31,11829005,Wanda,"Matt was very helpful and offered great suggestions. West Seattle is convenient to downtown, wish I had time to have taken the ferry."
8094338,46553885,2015-09-11,2664245,Florian,"Matt's/Louis's place is awesome. It's clean, comfortable and spacious. The neighbourhood is quiet and calm down. Just a perfect spot!
Buses take about 30-40 minutes to the city. A perfect value for the 58$/night."
8094338,47128532,2015-09-15,30973790,Christoph,Matt was a cool host! His house was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Using the water taxi to downtown is your best bet! I highly recommend staying with Matt and his cute dog!
8094338,47604712,2015-09-20,969244,Camille,"Wow! Staying here was just perfect. Will definitely keep Suite Louis on the short list for future trips to Seattle. 
Everything was clean and fresh and more private than we had anticipated for a shared house. Fresh fruit and snacks were provided really hit the spot after a long work day and a long drive.
Matt was super easy going, friendly and Louis was absolutely adorable. "
8094338,48633754,2015-09-27,29245160,Nancy,Matt's place was in a nice neighborhood which is a 40 min bus ride using bus 21 to downtown Seattle. Very nice and clean place. Matt is very friendly and even offered to pick us up from the airport for $20. Would definitely stay here again on next visit. 
8094338,51227202,2015-10-18,39471875,Kathryn,"Matt was a great host.  The place was immaculately clean and comfortable.  He provided lots of little details like toothbrushes, snacks, coffee, shampoo, etc that were really professional touches.  The location was great for us as we needed to be in West Seattle and we'd love to stay there again should we need another place in the area.  Our best airbnb experience thus far!"
8094338,51684225,2015-10-22,30131143,Jamie,"This was such a lovely place! Matt has a lot of little freebies for his guests, which we much appreciated the fruits and snacks! Too bad we couldn't play with Louis much since we got there so late. We would definitely stay here again just to play with Louis :)"
637326,32858594,2015-05-22,31472572,Elisabeth,"Staying with Ben and Chelsea was absolutely wonderful! They make you feel at home immediately and ensured anything I needed for my stay was there. The unit is gorgeous, a modern feel with wood burning fireplace, dishwasher, gas stove, oven and microwave. There was nothing I needed while staying there, they had pretty much thought of everything. I was even greeted with a bottle of wine, chocolates and fruit when I came into the house. 

You can get very cozy on the comfy couch provided and the big TV mounted on the wall. The bedroom is amazing too! The bed is so comfortable and there's tons of places to unpack to get settled in if you're staying awhile. The 6 foot tub is a must try if you enjoy baths! 

The location here is amazing too! You can walk to restaurants, bars, the lake and parks. This place is a total must to stay at if you're looking for a place in the Seattle area. I had two pets and there was a nice side yard for them and lots of sidewalks to take them on strolls. Ben and Chelsea are amazing hosts, raves all around!"
637326,33703053,2015-05-31,32089964,Francisco,"This was our first Airbnb excursion so we weren't sure what to expect. Except for minor miscommuncation regarding the door codes (which was resolved by calling a back up number), our stay was very pleasant. The location was perfect for us as we found it easy to get to various parts of Seattle to visit family and friends. 

The apt is on the ground level with a lot of natural light and the coded door means you don't need to fuss with keys, which we liked.

There's a great pub table for meals and it serves as a comfortable desk as well.  Even a lovely bottle of Rose wine left by our guests. Nice touch and appreciated.

Bedroom is quite cozy , but the bed was comfortable and the reading selection provided by our hosts was first rate. Big bathroom and functional kitchen made the apt a solid bargain. Because of the holiday schedule we didn't interact much with Benjamin, but he was responsive and helpful when requested. We would gladly stay there again.
"
637326,34654392,2015-06-10,31369191,Rai,"I stayed at Ben's house while I was waiting to move into my apartment. It was a great experience! The apartment was gorgeous and homey. I didn't get to see Ben or his family much but when I did they were always welcoming and friendly and he always answered promptly when I messaged him. Plus, the six-foot soaking tub was incredible! I would definitely recommend Ben's place."
637326,34864189,2015-06-13,8144625,Linda,"What a wonderful apartment.  Just as described, it is sun filled and a very comfortable place to hang out (more cozy than the picture suggests).  The entire apartment looks newly remodeled and contemporary, lots of nice touches.  The kitchen/bathroom are well equipped, the bed (and couch) comfortable and everything is very clean. 

Benjamin was very responsive, friendly, and even had a nice bottle of WA wine in the fridge and coffee in the grinder for our arrival.  We did not meet in person but texted and email to good effect.  We did not use the cottage garden-like side yard but enjoyed the view. The location is in a quiet family neighborhood - convenient and close to U. WA and Hwy 5, but quiet inside.  

We stayed here with my mother for a U. WA graduation and my 2 adults kids came to make breakfast.  Plenty of room for all of us.  

We give our entire experience two thumbs up and will definitely stay here again when we are in Seattle."
637326,35709115,2015-06-21,12452611,Miranda,A perfect little apartment!  The host was very helpful and responsive.  Street parking was super easy.  The apartment was very comfortable and had everything I needed.  Great experience!
637326,36276908,2015-06-27,30053628,Inigo Alfonso,"Great place; very cozy and homey! Didn't really think it'd be possible, but it looks even better in person than the pictures. Didn't get to use the heated floors much since it was really hot in Seattle when I visited but the floors really make the place seem so modern. The living space was nice with a nice TV that had Netflix on it. The bedroom, especially the bed, was very comfortable. The bathroom with the great tub was amazing as well; completely stocked with everything you would need. Parking was easy and the location was very close to everything without being in the middle of everything. "
637326,36743180,2015-06-30,34066324,Mike,"The place was fantastic. Exactly as described, no surprises and even a complimentary bottle of wine. Couldn't ask for anything better. "
637326,43662742,2015-08-21,39505174,Barbara,"Wonderful apartment which is well located.  Just as it was described, it was very light and airy.  Most appreciated was the fact that we could have our dog there.  The brief contact with our hosts was also very pleasant and I am sure had we needed any information or help in any way they would have been able to provide it.  "
637326,44532979,2015-08-27,17113190,Sarah,"The location was very convenient for visiting our family. All the needed information was provided in a timely way. We were interested in being independent and that worked just fine. Very nice well-equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood. 
"
637326,45142554,2015-08-31,2157419,Michael,"Benjamin's rental was wonderful.  It was incredibly clean, and very welcoming.  Benjamin is a great host, very responsive with great suggestions.  Thanks for encouraging me to check out the Olympics!"
637326,45685955,2015-09-05,8760368,Garrick,"Ben's place in the Maple Leaf neighborhood was awesome!  We used to live in Seattle and were in town for a weekend and felt perfectly at home.  

The space was clean, hip, and had everything that we needed.  The kitchen is basically fully stocked with utensils and the provided AppleTV is always a nice touch."
637326,46171002,2015-09-08,40896957,Margaret,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment is well-appointed and had everything we needed. We cooked a few meals and the kitchen was fully loaded with everything we needed--pots, pans, cutting boards, etc. The bed was super comfortable, the bathtub was huge and they have a cute little garden in the front yard! The apartment is really convenient to public transit; we came from out of town with no car and had no trouble catching buses into downtown, even during a holiday weekend. Ben was attentive and easy to communicate with the entire time. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Ben!"
637326,50111304,2015-10-09,43069599,Debra,"We arrived around 8 PM, and Ben welcomed us in the best way - with a bottle of white wine in the fridge and some yogurts for the next morning's breakfast. Both were greatly appreciated.

The space is welcoming and was a good size for us and for our dog over a week. The space is well described on the airbnb site. The kitchen is well-stocked and our hosts seem to think of everything we could possibly need - from spices, to colanders, to a hair dryer, to coffee.

The bathroom is lovely - loved the subway theme - and the shower worked great.

We did find that we were a little cold, even with turning up the heat to 72˚F (much warmer than we would normally set) and wearing sweaters. So bring layer and some good slippers or wool socks. Also keep in mind that this is a basement flat and the owners live upstairs. It can be a little noisy in the bedroom in the mornings (I think the bedroom is directly under a table) and when their TV is on in the evenings; however, the noise is not excessive and to be expected in a basement unit.

This is an easily walkable neighborhood and the bus going into Seattle is only a few blocks walk. Highly recommend."
637326,53267203,2015-11-07,3161712,Lorenzo,"Benjamin place is in an excellent location and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Ben lives just upstairs, is friendly and easy to reach for any need. The Apple TV works well and the kitchen is complete if you need to cook something."
637326,54027091,2015-11-15,4885235,John,Very welcoming. Just as advertised. A very nice space with several bonus amenities that we didn't expect.
637326,55130426,2015-11-28,37624428,Jennifer,Ben was a great host. He made the check in process very simple and was very communicative throughout the stay. The space was great. Very clean and homey with lots of natural light. Would definitely have visitors stay here again while visiting in Seattle.
637326,55678336,2015-12-04,26976825,Debra,Place was cuter than the pictures. Ben was easy to communicate with. 
637326,58428704,2016-01-02,12554889,Calder,"Wonderful place! Thanks so much Benjamin! Really appreciated how comfortable you've made the space, and how generous you are as a host! Thanks for the extra chairs!
Would definitely reccomend this place to anyone.
Thanks again!

7887651,46027528,2015-09-07,5658906,Le,Welcoming and accommodating host. Room is clean and very spacious. Our stay was very enjoyable. 
7887651,53518194,2015-11-09,47060727,Elaine,"This is our first experience with Airbnb and it was great!  I had general questions (and questions on how Airbnb works) and Jeff made sure I was taken care of though out the entire experience: he responded promptly with all my answers and his wife filled in when Jeff was not available.  If we needed anything during our stay, they were readily available via text.  They were very helpful and made sure we were well provided for.

We had the queen bed bedroom (w/ private bathroom) and access to the rooftop (360 deg view of Seattle).  I especially appreciated the general cleanliness, washer/dryer, kitchen facilities had all the appointments just like home-pots/pans, dishes, glasses, refrigerator, dish washer, stove/oven, microwave and conveniences (easy access to buses, grocery/necessities and centrally location to Seattle sites).  We had access to the large living room (including a modern convex wall mounted fireplace) room/kitchen area (multi-purpose table for eating/desk work and kitchen cabinets storage) and even a Seattle tour book.  We were welcomed with chocolates, an extremely comfortable bed/pillows, spacious closet with hangers, a tall dresser and end table, and desk w/ chair and plenty of room to move around in.

There are other visitors in this townhouse.  They were quiet and we did bump into one of them.  They were very friendly and respectful and we felt welcomed and safe.

Our overall stay was an A-1 experience and we do plan to stay at Jeff's place the next time we are in Seattle again."
7887651,56188531,2015-12-10,195661,Eleanor,"This was a great spot to start my time in Seattle - I had a spacious master bedroom with morning sun, and a large bathroom and closet - very comfortable.  There was also a private roof deck, however  the cold weather  kept me from trying it out.    Guests are welcome to use the living room and kitchen, so I was able to cook meals. 

When I arrived, Ying met me at the light rail station. She and Jeff are truly lovely people. They no longer reside in the townhouse, but are a text away. They take very good care of their home and look out for their guests’ comfort.  

I wasn’t familiar with the Beacon Hill neighborhood, and it turned out to be a very convenient location. A bus to downtown is a half block away and comes regularly.  The light rail station is about a 10 min. walk - and a grocery store is across the street from it.  I didn’t have a car, and didn’t need one at all.  

I really enjoyed my stay here, and would definitely return if I need a place to stay in Seattle."
693956,2986891,2012-11-28,759366,Michael,Stayed for a week & house was as gorgeous as pics indicate.  Owners were out of town but organized a nice neighbor contact for any issues (there were none).  Organization/communication was great.
8553556,49284625,2015-10-02,28806658,Ashley,"We had a great stay at Kevin's apartment! It's very conveniently located to downtown, public transit, and the major attractions. The apartment itself is nice, with a great kitchen and comfy bed. Kevin was really flexible with our arrival and departure, and quick to respond to messages if we had any questions. We will definitely stay there again if we ever return to Seattle!"
8553556,49850818,2015-10-06,30551365,Sara,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kevin's. The location is perfect for when you want to get out in the city everyday, which is what we did. The place has everything you need and the bed is super comfy! Kevin stayed in touch, got us in late, and gave us tips on how to get from the airport to his place. "
8553556,50557891,2015-10-12,6750915,Kate,"This was a great airbnb experience, once again. Kevin was awesome, he took us up and gave us a tour and the keys before he left for his flight. The location was fantastic, just up the street from Pikes place and the fact that parking was included was the cherry on top. The place was great, spacious for a one bedroom city center condo. All of the amenities I could have asked for were provided. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Seattle, thank you again!!"
8553556,51191901,2015-10-18,45534613,Natalie,"Kevin made us feel welcomed and kept in touch with us frequently. He showed us around and let us occupy his parking space. The neighborhood was safe and close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. The apartment was spacious and was in the perfect location. "
8553556,51950787,2015-10-25,7676734,Phil,Kevin's place was awesome.  He got us into the place as soon as we arrived and we had everything we needed.  Location was perfect too - walking distance to the market as well as several places to eat & drink.
8553556,52305831,2015-10-27,9517608,Alex,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8553556,52543549,2015-10-30,7964980,Darin,"Kevin's place worked out great for me, it was very close to where I needed to be for the week.  The place was exactly what I expected and Kevin was very accommodating with my late night arrival and parking needs. "
8553556,53353282,2015-11-08,796379,Michaela,"Kevin showed us around once we arrived, arrival and departure schedule was flexible so we really enjoyed that. 
The place is great, large living room couch and bed were very comfortable.
The location! This was hands down the best part. A short walk to lots of downtown attractions and restaurants!

"
8553556,53998548,2015-11-15,38309976,Dalip,"Great AirBNB Experience. Kevin was friendly, enthusiastic and very accommodating. His place was clean & comfortable. Not to mention, very close to all the hot spots in Seattle! 

We arrived early morning and he was flexible with check-in which was amazing. He also gave us helpful tips regarding airport transportion which immediately saved us a few bucks. 

Overall, fantastic experience and would recommend's Kevin's place to anyone!"
8553556,54868699,2015-11-25,3678003,Mike & Sally,"Very very easy visit to Kevin's nice place. Great location, perfect for our purposes on our one-night stay.  Unit is pretty much exactly as pictured and described in the listing, very comfortable, convenient, and parking passes just make it that much better. Kevin himself easy to work with and get in touch with, very responsive and helpful. We would love to stay there again."
8553556,55141901,2015-11-28,34943604,Billie,"Great place overall. Kevin was very attentive and explained everything to us when we got in. Everything was as described in the listing, the only confusion being that the WiFi is an open network, not private, so we did not feel comfortable using it. Overall great spot in the perfect downtown location. Thanks~!"
8553556,57342235,2015-12-24,30845599,Satya,"Location was great. Place was smaller than I realized. Linens rumpled, generally less clean than expected, parking was slightly inconvenient, but Kevin was nice and helpful. "
193371,2362587,2012-09-21,3401290,Richard,"We ( 4 adults) enjoyed our stay at Ana's townhouse.  It was very clean and quiet, and in a very convenient location for visiting Seattle."
193371,4741615,2013-05-23,3782804,Judy,This was a great rental experience.  The condo was clean and located in a wonderful neighborhood.  I would recommend this for small families or two couples.  Thanks Ana!
193371,5448267,2013-07-01,5336539,Robyn,"The townhouse was a fabulous venue for our wedding stay in Seattle.  The house was well equipped, spacious and comfortable.  As a party of 6 we appreciated the finer touches and attention to detail in each room.  A central location with easy access to public transport and taxis to down town.  Overall, Ana was very accommodating with booking our stay from Australia. I highly recommend this accommodation.  Robyn."
193371,11834053,2014-04-16,8884863,Noam,Second stay. Review provided after first stay. Both Ana and her house are great!
193371,12063404,2014-04-22,8884863,Noam,"Family of five had a great time in this house. Well equipped with all the amenities needed, clean and conveniently located. And Ana was graciously accommodating. "
193371,12316058,2014-04-28,14545831,Seth,"Excellent place to stay in Seattle, close to downtown, very convenient location with lots of restaurants close by for a quick bite. "
193371,13873508,2014-06-07,7442253,Chandler,"Bright and clean, had ample space for three adults and two small children, comfy beds, good location near restaurants, grocery stores, cafes, and parks. We didn't have much trouble finding parking, though there were occasions during weekday afternoons were parking was an issue, seemingly due to a daycare on the same street."
193371,15131865,2014-07-03,13202656,Mark,"We rented the townhouse for visiting family members attending our wedding.  With multiple bedrooms and bathrooms it was very comfortable for 4.  The kitchen has everything you need to make a few meals.  The neighborhood is great because there are many coffee houses, restaurants, and interesting shops within easy walking distance.  It is also a short distance to Madison Park, Capitol Hill, and even downtown.  It made for a wonderful visit for my family."
193371,16462271,2014-07-28,2610225,Tracy,"Ana's Casa is wonderful and was perfect for our family trip to Seattle!  The house was bright, cheerful, clean and tidy with a superbly outfitted kitchen to boot!  The location is great and so close to walking to great restaurants, shops and coffee spots on Madison Ave.  We didn't get to meet Ana in person on this trip, but communicated with her several times via email; she was very attentive to our questions and very helpful!  We will be back!"
193371,16648841,2014-07-31,5374310,Laura,"Ana was out of town when we arrived, but she made it super easy for us to let ourselves in. She provided a very useful notebook full of all the information that we could need....wifi code, how to dispose of trash, neighborhood shopping and restaurants. She also very thoughtfully provided us with milk, juice and cookies! Everything was sparkling clean and well-maintained.

Our group was made up of two middle-aged couples, and the house was a great size and layout for us. Each couple had a bedroom and bathroom on their own floor of the house for a little privacy, while the kitchen, dining and living room areas were perfect places to visit or share a meal when we wanted to spend time together. 

The house is located in an area that offers restaurants, shopping and some lovely outdoor spaces like parks bordering Lake Washington and the Arboretum. It also provides easy access to major highways and downtown Seattle. 
"
193371,17185617,2014-08-08,17034735,Liyia,"Ana was a great host. The instructions were very clear and easy to understand. There's everything in the Casana, and sparkle clean. Very convenient location, easy access to everywhere! We are very happy that our first experience with Airbnb was such a success. Thank you Ana!"
193371,17615274,2014-08-15,15637105,Peggy,"Very nice and clean townhouse, comfortable beds and well appointed kitchen. Pleasant and safe neighborhood with a wonderful restaurant and bakery close by. Bus stop around the corner made it very convenient to get to downtown or the Seattle Center. "
193371,20434648,2014-09-29,2749596,Clint,Ana's place was GREAT!!! Great Location Great house. Super convenient. I would come back in a heartbeat. 
193371,20951512,2014-10-08,11453659,Marti,"Two adult couples stayed with Ana and it was a delightful experience.  The neighborhood has several excellent restaurants within a couple of blocks, and you just shoot down Madison to Pioneer Square in a matter of minutes. There is a great knitting store a fifteen minute walk along Madison  and several interesting shops.  A Trader Joes is within a mile and there are plenty of pots and pans for cooking and plenty of dishes.  The beds were comfortable and the living area very nice.  As we left the other couple said ""be sure to give Ana a really good review"".  Highly recommended."
193371,21345098,2014-10-15,18115358,Dawn,"Ana was a great host with very nice accommodations. We felt at home in their house and very comfortable in the neighborhood - both are so cute! 
Love the location, love the house (incl. the layout for common area which still provides ample privacy for 2 couples, beds, kitchen, amenities - in no particular ranking order). The overall location was perfect for us to travel to downtown Seattle, Fremont, Ballard, Kirkland, Everett, and Bellevue. "
193371,22873315,2014-11-16,23641157,Rong,"we enjoy staying your house in (email hidden)at is really great memory here.especially every morning running around Washington botanical garden, beautiful view and good location. I will be back next time . "
193371,24322035,2014-12-26,7034184,John,The condo is perfect for a family of five. It's located near the Arboretum and we took advantage of that for running. The Essential Cafe around the corner is great. The house is clean. And Ana was awesome when we lost a Kindle in the house and figured out a way for us to pick it up. A great experience. We'd stay there again. 
193371,29821564,2015-04-13,11124501,Julia,This place is amazing! It's truly beautiful. No one actually lives here. She uses it as a bnb but every single thing you find in your home is available. It was perfect for everyone. Getting in was an issue but that's because there was a number missing for the lock box. Anna was at a tennis game and was unable to answer straight away but I logged into airbnb and was able to get the missing digit. I would absolutely stay here again.
193371,32338216,2015-05-17,28097476,Leecia,"We truly enjoyed our stay. Throughout the process, the host was responsive, flexible, and welcoming. The home was exactly as advertised - plus it was spotless and the location was great. My husband and I were in town for a family wedding - and needed a place that would work for us, our two small children, and my father in law. The set up of the home was perfect for the 5 of us. With a bedroom on the first floor - my father in law was able to have a little privacy, at times, which kept everyone happy. Thanks for a great stay! "
193371,32878509,2015-05-23,25909865,E,"The house was in a fantastic location with easy access to public transportation and great restaurants and shops.  We also had a supermarket within walking distance which made it super convenient.  Ana's place was exactly as pictured and was absolutely immaculate.  Everyone in our family had their own space and privacy which we all appreciated.  There were lots of thoughtful details like slippers by the door, dish soap in the kitchen, and even a collection of DVDs to watch!  We would definitely recommend Ana's place to our friends and would welcome the opportunity to stay there again when we return to Seattle.

Thank you Ana!! "
193371,34319811,2015-06-07,32870397,Brian,"House was great.  perfect place to stay in a great, central location.  easy access to all Seattle has to offer."
193371,36185413,2015-06-26,20038216,Cindie,"Perfect Capitol Hill location!  Walking distance to great restaurants, Washington Park, and classic neighborhoods.  Great three-level condo with everything needed.  We took the bus or walked everywhere from this great headquarters.  Ana was great and we would stay here again."
193371,36525446,2015-06-29,31548621,Nancy,"
Ana was very kind and timely in her response to any requests we made.Her home was spotless, the kitchen was well-stocked, even for our family of five and the beds were very comfortable.  The house is in a fabulous (email hidden)ny fun eateries nearby with bus transportation to downtown Seattle a stones throw from her home.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend Ana's place to anyone and everyone visiting Seattle!"
193371,36965105,2015-07-03,1872009,Tabitha,Host was very accommodating of requests. Everything clean and well stocked. Location was close to amenities. Would recommend. 
193371,41582336,2015-08-08,30361007,Paige,"A wonderful rental! If I visit Seattle again I would try to stay here again. The photos and description of the house online are very accurate. The home is very comfortable and spacious. The neighborhood was quite, but close to some really great places to eat. The owner, Ana, provided a warm welcome when we arrived. This is certainly the best experience I have had renting, and I feel so fortunate to have found such a lovely home. Thank you!!"
7054225,38089777,2015-07-13,28664208,Yan,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7054225,38197568,2015-07-13,764722,Erin,"My boyfriend and I had such an amazing time at Kristen's apartment. It's impeccably decorated, charming, and in the best possible location - we had everything we needed in the unit itself, Stumptown coffee around the corner, and more food / drink / access to the rest of Seattle than we could shake a stick at. It was wonderful. We'd highly, highly recommend Kristen's place; she's so warm and communicative as a host! Thanks again, we hope to be back soon :)"
7054225,39977855,2015-07-27,33655185,Katie,"My best friend and I tried airbnb for the first time recently. Kristen was great at communicating with us before our arrival and was ready and waiting once we arrived at her doorstep. Her place was just as described in her listing and nice and quiet. I'd never stayed in Capital Hill before, what a great neighborhood with lots of options for eats and going out. Everything was in easy walking distance for us, even strolling to the downtown was not too far of a walk. Would definitely stay there again."
7054225,40986167,2015-08-03,38533759,Ashley,"Kristen was great to work with, very communicative and accommodating! She helped make my first Airbnb experience a good one. Her place is as darling as shown in the pictures, and very clean to boot! It's in a great location with such an ease of access. Stay here and go exploring Capitol Hill, now!"
7054225,43128156,2015-08-17,40023165,Alison,"Kristen was a great host. She was really easy to communicate with and was very clear in providing all of the information we needed to check in, check out, park, etc. Kristen's home is beautiful and extremely comfortable. Also, her apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill. We walked almost everywhere and were minutes away from really great restaurants, bars, local shops, and other attractions. My boyfriend and I could not have picked a better spot to stay in Seattle! "
7054225,45260895,2015-09-01,21062451,Luke,"Kristen was a delightful host, and she was incredibly accommodating with check-in! We were perfectly located for the convention we were attending, and the house had every amenity we wanted. The apartment was perfect, and was much bigger than what the pictures suggested. We would absolutely recommend staying in Kristen’s listing to anyone interested. "
7581631,45135655,2015-08-31,37629684,Sharon,"William gave us extremely detailed directions and instructions on how to get to and in to his gorgeous little apartment. It was immaculate and well presented. The location is great, a minutes walk from major buses to get you into the Pike Place area and a wonderful coffee shop (quality that Aussies will love) and a great breakfast and lunch place that cater for gluten free. Thank you William for my first AirBnB experience, you have made me very keen to continue to travel this way! "
7581631,45632707,2015-09-04,3464826,Keshia,"Had an awesome stay at William's place, he was super quick to respond to our emails and really accommodating to our needs. The apartment is completely spotless. The furniture and design of the apartment is beautiful and simple. Everything has been thought of, totally equipped kitchen and bathroom. Loved having the washer and dryer there also. We had a car and found driving and parking super easy at the apartment. We didn't use public transport but there are buses on the street all the time that go straight to the city and other great areas of Seattle. Loved that the apartment is on the ground floor so there is no hauling luggage/children. We travel with our two little boys all over the world staying in Airbnb's and this is definitely one of the best we have stayed in. "
7581631,48536882,2015-09-27,8923616,John,"We moved our son into college this week and the location was perfect, as was the place itself. We're able to go to the store and get our own food and we also tried some local restaurants within walking distance especially liking Pomodoro, a small Italian restaurant where the chef waits on you personally. It was a nice walk through Eastlake and then through campus to the football game, about 2 miles, and that made it easy to get in and get out. Well sort from the neighborhood and saw all the sleepless in Seattle homes on the water, and we really enjoyed our visit. The place was superclean, reminded us of an IKEA showroom. We had a Rent-A-Car and the parking was no problem. The host was always available and stayed in touch with us, definitely one of our better air B&B experiences"
7581631,53469258,2015-11-09,43464471,Seo,"I stayed at William’s place for a month and had a wonderful stay. Photos of the apartment are true to life and was extremely clean. The apartment was very well equipped for a long term stay; every need seemed to have been anticipated. Fully outfitted kitchen with pots and pans, dinnerware, glassware, flatware, mixing bowls, etc. Anything one could reasonably require to prep and cook. Bathroom was well stocked with towels and amenities. Beds were comfortable, and both rooms had dressers/closets/hanging space, and double pane windows for the best possible night’s sleep. Everything seemed to have been very thoughtfully and meticulously arranged.

William provided detailed instructions regarding arrival, self-entry, and parking. The neighborhood is charming. Close to the lake, super safe, quiet, and walkable. Cafes, a small market, and buses are within close walking distance. Very easy freeway access. The location was very convenient to many areas of Seattle.

William was a super gracious and kind host. He responded to all queries promptly and swiftly resolved any issues that popped up during my stay. Overall, I couldn’t have asked for a nicer experience. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit Seattle."
7581631,54314995,2015-11-18,20329688,Ashley,"What a wonderful experience staying at this lovely two bedroom apartment. It was just as it looked in the photos, beautiful art and decor with lots of space for two people. The location is perfect to get quickly to most Seattle neighbourhoods and was very quiet even though it was close to the I5. We throughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly return for our next trip to Seattle. "
7581631,57230211,2015-12-23,25871488,Ryoco,William is an amazing host. The room is super organized and well equipped with all appliances. All kitchen utensils are there for family cooking. Highly recommended for family staying.
8559462,54406909,2015-11-19,48597720,Phil,Good communication from the host. The bungalow was ideal for our stay. It was very clean and was more than enough room for us and our needs. The best part was that it was convenient for our visit with our daughters family and new grandson. I recommend others stay here also.
9174327,55261759,2015-11-29,4422998,Teresa,"We really enjoyed this charming setting during our Thanksgiving week stay. The care and thoughtfulness put into making this room and the accessories comfortable are evident in everything from the décor to the practical availability of the mini kitchen where we were able to create our contribution to our family holiday dinner. Judy is a welcoming and helpful host; we especially appreciated the maps of the area and robes and slippers that were provided. As it was a holiday trip, we spent most of our time with family but look forward to staying here again on future trips."
1107845,5926365,2013-07-22,695021,Casey,"Owen's place was in a charming building that was incredibly convenient.  The bed was very comfy, and the place was tidy.  If you're looking for a spot in Capitol Hill that's convenient to lots of entertainment, dining and tourist options, this is it! "
1107845,6015444,2013-07-26,7593190,Reilly,Great stay-- apartment as advertised. Easy walking distance to downtown. Owen sent keys to me in advance. Very accommodating. 
1107845,6142800,2013-07-31,1541470,Aaron,"Owen was an excellent host. He was easy to work with and has a great place with an awesome location. It is within easy walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and downtown. I would definitely stay at his place again. "
1107845,6406142,2013-08-11,6928715,Heather,"We had a great stay here! The apartment has an amazing view of the Space Needle! We were able to walk to all the major attractions, Space Needle, Safeco Field for a game, Pike Place Market, and the ferry station to Bainbridge Island. Owen was a great host and very responsive to all of our questions. The neighborhood has a bunch of great restaurants and you are super close to the convention center as well. "
1107845,6472667,2013-08-13,2127135,Jason,"Location. Location. Location. It was SUPER easy to get to the trains, buses and ferries from Owen's place. We easily found Car2Go in the area and they were usually available. It was great to stay in Capitol Hill, since there are no reasonable rate hotels in the area. Close to all the bars/restaurants/shops and walkable to Pike Place Market. Apartment is all you needed: bed, bathroom and a small kitchen. Worked perfectly. "
1107845,6699398,2013-08-21,8133994,Anna,"Great location and Owen was really helpful with suggestions for paces to eat, where to get great coffee and running routes. Loved Seattle and the experience was so much better being in a cool little place that was easy walking distance to Pike Market, downtown, and all the other touristy spots."
1107845,6767418,2013-08-24,7610269,Leann,"I wouldn't ask for any more from this place. It was clean, super comfortable, nicely furnished with great views in an unbeatable location. I recommend it. "
1107845,6829113,2013-08-26,8141867,Jon Paul,"It was a great apartment in a very good location. It was a short walk to downtown and it had a neighborhood feel since it was in Capitol Hill. Best of both worlds. Owen was a great guest who laid out clear instructions on retrieval of keys and amenities, and he also always responded quickly to e-mails.

Oh, and a great view!"
1107845,6949400,2013-08-31,31210,Michael,"Owens place was great! Centrally located in Capitol Hill, near great coffee shops and great restaurants. I'd certainly stay again :)"
1107845,7731684,2013-09-30,4352256,Pj,Owens place was awesome and was in the perfect location. It was within walking distance to downtown and to all fun places for the drinking and dinner. I would book his place anytime.
1107845,10553286,2014-02-24,10620839,Jennifer,A great easy place right where I needed to be. Thanks Owen!
1107845,10683587,2014-03-03,11574964,Elizabeth,"This was our first time using airbnb and we were nervous. But Owen was kind and helpful and very generous, and his Capital Hill apt was beautiful, airy, and incredibly centrally located. We were just a few blocks from downtown and Pike Place Market, and his building was surrounded by awesome restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops (not to mention Elliott Bay Book Company). We had a great stay, and would definitely rent from Owen again."
1107845,11195730,2014-03-24,13000152,Chris,"Owen's apartment is perfectly situated between Pine and Pike, making it an ideal location if you're looking to check out the culture (bars, restaurants, bookstores, records shops, clothing boutiques, etc, etc, etc,) of Capitol Hill. And you can also stroll along Pike directly to the market and other downtown destinations — an easy 20-minute walk. 

Owen's place is a studio apartment with a bed, a couch, a loveseat, and kitchen. It's cozy and has all the essentials you need. Owen has blankets, towels, soap, etc. laid out for us. There's a TV (no cable, though), wifi, and even a little desk if you want to get some work done. That said, if you're looking for a modern apartment to rent, this probably isn't your place — it's outdated, small, and feels a little like a studio apartment you'd rent in college. But a great place to lay your head and get easily out into the city.  

Owen himself was remarkably helpful from start to finish. The keys were easy to retrieve; he offered great advice on places to grab a beer and rent a bike, etc.; he was quick to answer questions about the apartment; and while he was available, he also disappeared, letting us feel like the apartment was our own. 

I'll definitely give Owen a call again next time I'm in Seattle. "
1107845,11364233,2014-03-31,12777050,Amy,"We were in town for an event at the convention center, and we couldn't have found a better location than Owen's apartment. It was walking distance from everything we needed, and an easy transit ride from the airport. Owen was very helpful and accommodating, and made our first airbnb experience a breeze. We would definitely rent here again. Thanks Owen!!"
1107845,12105176,2014-04-22,10397429,Chris,"Owens place is in the perfect location if you're looking for a good fun night in Seattle. Walking distance to numerous bars and restaurants. Went to The Honey Hole a couple times for an awesome meal. Owen is a really cool, laid back guy. I would definitely recommend it to anybody visiting Seattle  "
1107845,13043471,2014-05-18,14540294,Anne,"This apartment is all about location - a great place to experience Capital Hill from. Comfortable bed and sofas - but make no mistake, this is like staying in a student's studio flat. Same level of cleanliness (or lack thereof) and particularly grungy and ill-equipped kitchen. This is a place for a single person or a couple - maximum. Owen was very pleasant, but didn't exactly rush over to correct the situation when I mentioned the cleanliness issue "
1107845,13250243,2014-05-23,7838217,Shengyin,"Owen and his brother were very responsive hosts.  Josh was at the apartment when we arrived and got us everything we needed.  During the stay, Owen texted and checked-in to see if we needed anything.

The location was ideal for the conference center.  It was just a few blocks downhill in the mornings, and by the walk back in the evenings, the bars and restaurants were open and were nice motivation to make it back uphill.  
The neighborhood is very hip and there were lots of young people out all over (in the afternoons and evenings).  It wasn't a problem finding a spot for a happy hour or dinner.  If you are touring Seattle, it was a little bit more of a walk, or an easy transit /taxi tide to the major tourist locations.  I did have a rental car for the first 2 days for visiting Tacoma.  It was great that Owen provided a visitor parking pass to park in the neighborhood, although hard to find a spot on Saturday night (but not surprising).  

The apartment was as advertised - the view of Seattle was very nice, and it had what I needed for my work travel purposes.  I used the living area and the desk (and wifi) for working.  The full-size fridge in the kitchen was convenient, although, the kitchen was rather small if you intend to cook.   The bathroom had toiletries, but I brought my own.  There was a nice TV that you can hook up your computer to for watching videos (I didn't try seeing if there was actually TV signal available).   

The only downsides, which I suspect Owen would take care of if I cared enough about these factors to text him, were the lack of a hand towel in the bathroom, the sink in the kitchen needed a scrubbing, and there were a few dust bunnies all around (if you have allergies).  Again, I suspect that if it bothered me enough to ask, the host probably would have been very responsive about it.  The little things didn't overshadow the broader picture that the apartment was in a great location, had all the amenities I needed, and the view of the city was a nice plus.  Overall, I was very comfortable and pleased with the place.  "
1107845,13520513,2014-05-29,2696951,Drew,"Owen's place was fantastic, with a gorgeous view. The location was close to everything in downtown Seattle and had everything we needed around it. Owen was super helpful and checked in on us during our stay...he even left us a bottle of wine!! Would definitely stay again."
1107845,13788907,2014-06-04,14565321,Matt,"Owen's place was exactly what we were looking for, and met the expectations set by the listing. The entire stay we really felt the place was ""ours."" And if you're looking for a great, sweeping view of downtown, including the Space Needle, this is the place for you. Great location in Capitol Hill, too: right near tons of restaurants, coffee shops, nightlife, and, if you're a book lover, the Elliott Bay Book Company. Easily walkable to downtown. Lots of car2gos as well.

Coming from Texas, we were somewhat worried about the unit not having A/C during June, but the mornings and nights were very cool and pleasant, and Owen's blackout shades easily kept out the late afternoon sun, and the fan helped too. "
1107845,13935412,2014-06-08,14435871,Tony,Can't beat this location.  Easy to book and check-in.  Great place for restful sleep and short breaks between sightseeing and activities.  Owen made sure we had a contact if we needed anything--which we never had to use.  Would definitely stay again.  Thanks!
1107845,14165195,2014-06-13,15996441,Marc,"Owen's place is located in a fantastic spot.  It was a short walk to downtown while also being surrounded by several great restaurants and bars.  We took the train in and it was only about a $10 Uber ride away and only a ~15 minute walk to the light rail to take us to the airport.

If you are there on a Monday night and have time, check out the basement bar at The Cider House as they have an open music night on the stage where the crowd swaps in and out with singers and several different instruments and was a great time.

Owen and his brother were very responsive to any questions we had and had everything ready when we arrived; hand towels and blankets set out and even left us a bottle of wine.

The apartment is a decent size, but could have used a little bit more cleaning; nothing terrible, but some relatively minor things that could be taken care of pretty easily.  

Also, we were asked to tell neighbors that we were friends of Owen's if anyone in the building asked; no one asked us and I guess that is pretty common request on Airbnb.  It didn't seem to be a problem as we did come across several people in the building who didn't ask us anything, but just a heads up in case anyone feels uncomfortable in that position."
1107845,14311990,2014-06-16,1709673,Eric,"Wonderful experience! Owen gave very clear, concise directions and we were never confused about anything."
1107845,15602820,2014-07-12,17602244,Andrea,Great experience! Owen was really responsive and helpful. The apartment is charming and very comfortable. The view is fantastic. It's walking distance to so much great stuff too. I'd love to stay again. 
1107845,15769345,2014-07-15,5435774,Kaitlyn,"Owen's place was awesome! Great view and in a great, central neighborhood.  It was great that organizing the apartment was so easy for our trip.  He provided all of the information we could've possibly needed and was very responsive for the few questions I did have for him.  I'd definitely stay there again!"
1107845,16067839,2014-07-21,15581510,Julia,"Awesome place, great location, with easy access to the train and walkable to most of the places we wanted to go to. Beautiful view and extremely easy check in- check out process. Owen explained where to find everything very well and we loved staying at his place!"
1107845,16226716,2014-07-23,10331180,Stephanie,"I had some minor issues getting the key (my fault) and Owen was quick to call to make sure that everything was okay.  This apartment is perfect for someone looking to stay in a fun part of the city to have access to downtown or the Fremont area.  The apartment was clean, and the view was perfect as I sat at the desk getting last minute work finished.  "
1107845,16682304,2014-07-31,18267774,Jamie,"Owen was wonderful. Very responsive, attentive, and helpful. We had a wonderful time staying at his place. It is a perfect location and has everything you need while in Seattle. A stones throw from great restaurants, coffee and fun...and a nice safe & secure building. "
1107845,16815230,2014-08-02,4145077,Wouter,"Owen was very accommodating in arranging for the apartment to be available same day when I arrived in Seattle and checked for availability. The apartment is in a very characteristic building with an awesome Parisien elevator. The apartment had all amenities I required for my stay which was largely out and about in the cool hipster neighborhood with plenty of coffee places, bars and restaurants. The view over the city and especially with the sunset is unbeatable. 
It can get a bit warm inside with the sun shining in, but that's really a luxury in Seattle... :-)
I would have preferred if the construction site opposite the street wouldn't start at 7am, but I was there during the week so don't know if that's also in the weekend.
Also great was the guest parking card which Owen provided!"
1107845,17519147,2014-08-13,17923623,Sanjana,"This was my first time using AirBnB. Owen's place was great, and in a really good location that was central to everything.  He answered his phone readily with a question that we had upon arrival. Overall, I would definitely recommend his place to anyone coming to Seattle- as it is located in the ""hip"" capitol hill, yet also pretty close to downtown. We didn't have to rent a car or take any cabs while we were there- we walked to everything. 
Thanks Owen! "
1107845,18418587,2014-08-26,18235181,Gary,Loved staying in Owens place. A perfect setting between downtown for work ( near to convention centre) and Capitol Hill for fun. Everything I needed was on hand. A great stay all in all
1107845,18826953,2014-09-01,13310427,Stephen,"Owen's space was great and perfectly located for Convention Center activities. The apartment was clean well maintained. It was my first time staying in a secured building so remember to always take your building key with you!  Temporary parking permit was great. Overall was very pleased with the location and price, and Owen was very communicative."
1107845,19160394,2014-09-07,20533457,Chris,"Owen has very helpful. Place was good, clean and location wise convenient."
1107845,19715408,2014-09-16,19900531,Rebecca,"The picture of the view from this apartment does not do it justice, it really is spectacular.  Owen was great, he accommodated my boyfriend and I last minute after our previous host had cancelled.  Two hours after I initially requested to book the apartment, we were comfortably checked in with a bottle of wine waiting for us, which, after the last minute snafu with our other place was much appreciated.  The apartment is exactly as pictured and the neighborhood is great, plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance.  We visited some of the national parks outside Seattle and loved coming back to watch the sunset over Seattle from the very comfortable living area.  Would definitely stay here again!"
1107845,20054181,2014-09-22,7526849,Sharon,"We stayed at Owen's place for 4 nights, and it was great. He was very communicative and flexible with check-in/out times to accommodate our flights. It was our first time in Seattle, and Owen's place is in a convenient location. Within a 10-minute walk in any direction, you can get to Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. The convention center and retail core of downtown is only a few blocks away.

Photos are accurate to the apartment. Just one tip: The apartment is on the 6th floor, and the elevator is an old-timey one where you have to open the door and ""cage"" yourself vs. the doors opening automatically when you push the button. This was fine for us, as we didn't take it all the time (took the stairs), but a heads-up for less agile guests."
1107845,20393599,2014-09-28,21402162,Jay,"Everything was so fine, especially the location was the best. I was staying there for the Decibel Festival, and most venues were so close that I could walk all the time. Near restaurants and shops were also great experience. "
1107845,22388520,2014-11-04,11735394,Sa,Neat apartment in a great location. Would repeat!
1107845,22556436,2014-11-09,6509742,Max,"Bad news first, good news second. Owen's place is in an older, but nice, building right in the heart of things. When I arrived I had to fiddle with the lockbox in an odd place, and the elevator was one of those clumsy push-the-door open deals from yestercentury. A bottle of wine greeted my arrival, which was quite nice. Unlike most Airbnb ""whole apartments"" I've stayed in previously, this one is clearly someone's primary residence. The closets have that someone's stuff in them, the fridge has that someone's food. It was a touch shabby, but maybe more ""comfortable"" would be a better way to put it. Still, the place was adequate for my needs. Great wifi speed too.

The location is where Owen's place is awesome. You wouldn't know it by looking at the map, but this place is smack dab in the middle of a great area. I kept opening Yelp to look for coffee, or lunch, or even dance clubs, and the best options were just a few blocks away. Lots of transit options within a block, though the waterfront and Pike's Place were walkable for me.

All in all, while I was a bit underwhelmed by the apartment itself, I would totally stay here again."
1107845,25313130,2015-01-12,23432303,Eric,Funky vintage apartment building located in the perfect spot for checking out Capital Hill and downtown. Owen was totally on the ball and easy to work with. 
1107845,26032129,2015-02-01,26568399,Zhi,Very satisfied with host and apartment. Everything is the same as on the pictures. Host is very flexible to work for late check-out to accommodate my travel schedule. 
1107845,26676444,2015-02-17,11504247,Louis,"Owen's apartment is just what we were hoping for. The location is perfect for exploring the whole of Seattle, and the views are amazing! The apartment itself is nice, comfortable, and well equipped for everything you would need to be able to cook, live and sleep. Would recommend to anyone. "
1107845,28447655,2015-03-23,15292235,Kenney,"Owen, thanks so much for having me in your home! It was a great convenient location to get to downtown and still be stepping distance from all the fun restaurants/coffee shops on cap hill! Super cool view of the skyline and removed enough from the noise of the city. Also, Victrola and the Starbucks Roastery were right next door! :-)"
1107845,28711623,2015-03-29,18932252,Julia,"The apartment is cozy and clean. I was attending a conference at the Sheraton and had to be there at 8:30 every morning, and it was just a quick walk. Nice café right around the corner, convenience store, etc. No reason not to stay here. "
1107845,33394424,2015-05-27,10435447,Marina,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle, and Owen's apartment was located in Capitol Hill, where it was walkable to most (touristy) places. Ot was absolutely perfect for us. The apartment is as described in the pictures.  Owen was easy to get in touch/communicate! We had a great time, thanks Owen! "
1107845,33817879,2015-06-01,31737881,Kathryn,"Owen was quick to respond to our initial request and continued to be very helpful when we had questions/requests/asked for recommendations. He did a great job making sure that we had all necessary information about his apartment and how to get in, etc. prior to our arrival. From reading previous reviews we knew pretty well what to expect of the apartment and building. The location is great, it was nice to stay in a neighborhood and be able to easily walk to and from downtown during our stay. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood - my roommate and I loved Owen's recommendations and found plenty of other great spots on our own. "
1107845,35124562,2015-06-15,33911442,Daniel,"Apt was exactly as described and the view of downtown was great. The location was the best part with all kinds of great places to eat and see within walking distance. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the market that wasn't bad at all since its straight down the street. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you don't want to rent a car for your visit."
1107845,35684315,2015-06-21,33825609,Trang,Great first Airbnb experience with Owen! Comfy apartment in a great location. Owen was easy to get in touch with and was quick to answer any questions I had. 
1107845,36420382,2015-06-28,34659010,Kyle,"The stay was great. The apartment is right in the heart of Capitol Hill and only a couple blocks from the Pikes Place Market. It's also easy to get to from the highway. The apartment itself is good. Nice amenities with TV, bed, and full kitchen. But with this one the location is best!"
1107845,39297105,2015-07-22,34405786,Paul,"This apartment is in an excellent location in the busiest part of the city, great for walking. On Capitol Hill near downtown, it is a short walk to excellent restaurants on the hill, coffee shops (including the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room), and music venues. It's just a 15 minute walk across downtown to Pike Place Market.  Everything is within reach on foot.  Also easy airport access, taking the Light Rail from the airport to the end of the line, Westlake Center station, and walking from there. It was our first visit to Seattle and this was a great base.  Owen has an expresso maker as well, so buy some beans and make your own in the morning!"
1107845,54949114,2015-11-25,28612895,Edward,"Studio was spot on with the description. A short walk to downtown. Has a heater that is turned on at night (by the super?), and an additional plug-in heater. There are also a couple small convenience stores, a great cafe (Victrola), the Starbucks roasting room all within a block."
1107845,55647762,2015-12-03,30710647,Mari,"The ap was perfectly located for us and Owen made the key transition really easy! The heater kinda had its own schedule, but Owen has an additional electronic heater."
1107845,55841953,2015-12-06,11575479,Natasha,The place was exactly as described. Perfect location and very accommodating host. Comfortably fit 3 of us. Overall great experience!
1107845,56407434,2015-12-13,49205418,Marie,Owen was an amazing host.  He was easy to get a hold of and always responded quickly.  Getting into his place was no hassle with straightforward instructions.  The apartment was so charming and comfortable.  There were no surprises about his place from what was posted.  The place is centrally located in a very lively neighborhood.  There are a lot of great restaurants and shops just around the corner.  He is also just a short walk or Uber to Seattle's major attractions.  I highly recommend staying here if you want to vacation in Seattle.  Thank you Owen!  
1107845,56685364,2015-12-16,46499387,Sheng,I really enjoyed three days here. Different kind of room in my life haha
1107845,56962493,2015-12-20,50248228,Heesun,"처음으로 에어비앤비를 이용해보는데, 가기 전에 걱정되었지만 오웬씨가 잘 설명해 주셨고 집도 사진 그대로 였어요 ^^ 위치도 시애틀 다운타운에서 멀지 않았고 집주위가 시끄럽지 않고 좋았습니다."
1107845,57274932,2015-12-23,51782226,Aaron,"Owen' place was amazing! Very clean, great location, walking to downtown, and simply pleasant to hang out in. Only wish I had stayed here longer. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
86185,256950,2011-05-09,512044,Linda,"We had a nice room at Jane's place and  it just happened to very close to were we wanted to be, it is in a very nice part of west Seattle and the walking is great to the beach, we will be staying there again if they will have us."
86185,294570,2011-06-02,549863,Rick,"This was our first AirBNB experience but will not be our last.  Jane was a great host who respected our privacy but was always available to us when needed.  The accomodations were very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  Great location and neighborhood.  Enjoyed our walks.  The snacks were an extra nice touch. We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay with Jane again soon.  A great experience and we highly recommend Jane's a a place to stay.  Can't say enough.   "
86185,312143,2011-06-13,201293,Marge,"Jane's room was comfortably furnished and even had a gas fireplace.  She was thoughtful in putting out muffines, fruit, snacks, and coffee.  I did not see her except for the initial check in, when she was helpful.  The house was quiet and in nice neighborhood."
86185,342744,2011-06-29,84887,Brian,"Jane's basement room in West Seattle was the perfect quiet and cozy getaway I needed from the hustle and bustle of NYC.  The bed is comfortable, snacks are provided, and Jane offers great tips and thoughts on the city and the neighborhood.  The house is also easy walking distance to Alki beach, where you will have beautiful views of Elliot Bay and the city skyline.  I hope to be able to stay there again!

Brian"
86185,358917,2011-07-07,699445,Tiffani,"This place was perfect for our time in Seattle. It had all the basic essentials - a cozy bed, a dresser, outlets for plugging in phones/electronics, a faux fireplace that my boyfriend loved, and a shower room with some toiletries provided. The hosts also left breakfast items, sodas, and other snacks for the road, which we appreciated immensely! Besides our check-in, we didn't see them at all; but our schedules were rather different. My boyfriend and I enjoy sleeping in until around 10am and exploring the sights until well past midnight. In this way, the privacy afforded to us was greatly appreciated. Only one thing to note: If you are a light sleeper and you sleep late in the morning, you can hear footsteps above you in the main part of the house. This didn't bother us because we tend to sleep rather heavily, and the place exceeded our expectations in other ways. Overall, great experience, and we would definitely go back here! Thanks."
86185,390497,2011-07-23,668621,Loretta,I enjoyed my stay in West Seattle!  Jane was a very accommodating host.  The room was comfortable and secure.  It was a good location to walk to Alki Beach or take the water taxi to downtown to take in the sights. Jane left some lovely snacks and coffee etc. which was great.  She also allowed me to use her washing machine for my sons soccer gear which was much appreciated. Overall a great place to stay.
86185,457797,2011-08-19,821507,Tamara,"My husband and I really enjoyed Jane's place. She treated us with unexpected hospitality and was very generous in helping us plan our trip. The room was private, cozy, and the bed was comfy. We would absolutely spend time there again and will definitely refer our friends to her!"
86185,486824,2011-08-30,436207,Stephen,"We really enjoyed our stay at  Jane's ""West Seattle Cool"". For privacy and seclusion, it can't be beat. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Jane went out of her way to provide us with delicious, muffins, fruit, yogurt and great coffee with fixings. We plan on returning and will be using ""West Seattle Cool""."
86185,522637,2011-09-12,647707,Cheryl,"Wonderful space and Jane is an excellent hostess.  Comfortable, clean room; fruit, muffins, coffee and snacks left for us; tons of local tourist information displayed on coffee table; and books, DVDs, and TV for entertainment on rainy Seattle days.  The location can't be beat--minutes from California Ave and Alki Beach.  We had a fabulous time! 
"
86185,538434,2011-09-17,16613,Kathy,"Jane's place is a wonderful place to stay. It was quiet, comfortable and very cozy! It's close to the beach and walking distance to shops and restuarants. I'll be looking forward to staying there again!"
86185,699625,2011-11-07,16613,Kathy,"Jane has a great place! It's private, spacious, cozy and comfortable! It's within walking distance to the beach, shopping and parks! We had a great assortment of breakfast foods and Jane is a wonderful host!"
86185,891413,2012-01-30,16613,Kathy,"Jane is a wonderful host! She always checks on what we would like for breakfast. The room is very clean, comfortable and cozy! The bed is wonderful and the apartment is within walking distance to the beach and shopping. We love it there!"
86185,1583664,2012-06-28,2640427,Chris,"My girlfriend  & I stayed with Jane on a 7 day trip to Seattle.  It was our first time using AirBnB and I can't think of a better first experience.  From the beginning, Jane made sure we understood how the reservation policy worked right down to the last day where she made sure that we had had everything we needed.  Jane is great and she is a great host.  She was very helpful as well as allowing us our privacy at all times.  The place was wonderful and exactly as described.  Everything was nice and clean and my girlfriend swears that it is one of the most comfortable bed she has ever slept in.  Needless to say, we really enjoyed our experience.  Lastly, Jane is quite a knowledgeable woman if you need any tips on anything in the area.  She constantly steered us in the right direction.  I can't say enough good things about Jane or our first AirBnB experience, so I will stop before I ramble too long.  Thank You Jane.  Great place and great location!"
86185,1663383,2012-07-09,2259011,Lenora,Great stay in the perfect location for us.  Everything in the suite was just as described and exactly as expected.  Would recommend this place and would gladly stay here again.
86185,2018227,2012-08-18,16437,Rebecca,"My husband and I were in West Seattle to do child care for our grandson (7 months old) so we wanted to find a place nearby. Jane's place was perfect for us -- great location (near Aldi Beach too), and we enjoyed the sitting room with the TV (we brought DVDs) and sofa. Even though it is in the basement, it's light and cheerful with the windows opening up to the front yard. Thanks to Jane too for all the goodies she left out for us and in the refrigerator -- coffee and muffins, fruit, etc. The bed is very comfortable. We would stay there again.."
86185,3179812,2012-12-29,849407,Joni,"Jane was so kind to let us stay with her Christmas week while we visited our daughter who lives nearby.  The location was perfect for us.  Had the weather been better we could have walked to lots of restaurants and to Alki beach. The room was cozy and the bed ultra comfortable. Jane is very thoughtful, she left us a coffee pot, coffee, muffins, yogurt and other goodies which we were happy to have. You have complete privacy, like your own apartment. We would stay with Jane and Dave again. "
86185,5975612,2013-07-24,6765013,Anna,"We had a great time at Jane's place in Seattle. She was such a lovely host - even allowing us to start our time there while she was away. We found the house easily with her directions and were all set up with maps, suggestions, and LOTS of snacks upon our arrival. She also let us use the laundry, which was a godsend after all of our traveling! The room was comfortable and had everything that we needed. We were walking distance to Alki Beach and a short drive from the water taxi which was very easy and reasonable. I would highly recommend staying at Jane's place - it feels like you're in your own place and is the perfect location!"
86185,6269121,2013-08-06,1277295,Coree,"Our stay was amazing.  Not only was the location terrific, Jane is an incredible host.  

She provided us snacks and beverages in our room and we had access to a fridge and coffee maker. She also ensured that the ground level was completely ours which was wonderful privacy.  

I would recommend that anyone stay with Jane if going to Seattle as the neighborhood is great and the drive into downtown is simple.  Hopefully we will be back again soon and thank you Jane for a great experience."
86185,6791568,2013-08-25,7904224,Arthur,"We highly enjoyed our stay in this cozy getaway. The bed and couch were extremely comfortable, and the snacks were icing on the cake. 

The location was great for walks to the beach, local Safeway, and restaurants. There was a stand right on the beach where we could rent stand-up paddles, kayaks, and bikes. 

Jane was a great host who provided batteries for a flashlight and hand soap immediately after contacting her. 

Overall, a great place to stay."
86185,7220443,2013-09-11,6932741,Lauren,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a success! I booked this space for my Dad who was visiting me in Seattle and it was perfect for our needs. Jane was very responsive, thoughtful, and easy to work with both before and during my Dad's stay.  My Dad said it was a great location and hosted by very nice people. The room was nice and very private allowing him to come and go as he pleased. It was like having his own little apartment with access to a fridge and some snacks and such provided- anything that you need is right there. He also mentioned a few times how comfortable the bed was! We were both so pleased with this space and thank Jane and her husband for sharing it!"
86185,15780714,2014-07-15,16928767,Jillian,"This was my first time using airbnb and my first time in Seattle. I stayed at Jane's with a friend and the space was perfect for the both of us. There were breakfast foods, snacks, and wine waiting for us when we got there which was late at night. She stayed up and showed us around and was there when we needed her. She offered me wine one night when I was off to get dinner and I ended up having a nice conversation with her and her friend. Perfect distance to the beach for a nice run and close enough to shops and food to walk to if you don't have a car. She even drove me into the city herself when my friend was busy. I would definitely recommend Jane to anyone visiting Seattle!"
86185,16499611,2014-07-28,6092354,Daniel,"Our experience at the Admiral in West Seattle was fantastic. It started weeks before our arrival with our communication with Jane who was absolutely hospitable and quick to respond to messages and questions. When we arrived there was wine, snacks, coffee, cold beverages and other amenities like internet and maps of Seattle. Very quiet location and easy to find outside of downtown Seattle. We would definitely visit again and we enjoyed every minute of our stay!   "
86185,17054113,2014-08-06,17350738,Sam,This was our first Air bnb experience and it was a great one. Jane was very responsive throughout the process. She was out of town when we arrived so we did not end up crossing paths in person but she was welcoming and her generous touches were evident throughout our stay. The air bnb is very private (separate entrance and space) and it is comfortable and very near to Alki Beach (highly recommend). 
86185,18441173,2014-08-26,19335167,Fraser,"We really enjoyed our stay here. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and snacks. The room is nice, well appointed, and we had the entire basement to ourselves. The house is located in a great, quiet neighborhood, close to stores, restaurants, and Alki Beach, not to mention the gorgeous backyard (who is the landscape architect anyway?). It worked well for us visiting our daughter and her husband in West Seattle, since there are very few hotels in that section of town. I would recommend this to a friend, and would stay here again. "
86185,19912257,2014-09-20,6693284,Steve,"Staying at Jane's in West Seattle was a great choice. The room was large and comfy with plenty of extras. Fruit, snacks, coffee, milk and muffins. A short ferry trip to the CBD was easy. Go to Dale Chihuly glass exhibition, amazing. "
86185,20127955,2014-09-23,1829165,Scott,"Jane's place provided the perfect spot for a quick  3-night weekend trip to Seattle. It's like having your own private apartment. Very comfortable. She was very communicative and quick to respond in regard to all of our booking arrangements, but left us to do our own thing once we were settled."
86185,20468727,2014-09-29,13807757,Bernhard,"We had a very comfortable stay at Jane's. We received a warm welcome when we arrived, and made us feel right at home! Our room was very cozy and private. To get into Seattle we walked about 15 minutes to Seacrest Park to catch the water taxi. 

Jane was a wonderful host and I definitely recommend staying with her!"
86185,27066945,2015-02-24,2309334,Sarah,I had a good weekend at Jane's--I enjoyed the very comfortable bed and the biggest tv ever. It was very convenient to my friends in West Seattle. I appreciated Jane's interest in what I like for breakfast and finding it there waiting for me upon my arrival.
86185,34197293,2015-06-06,22647868,Harald,"Jane hat dafür gesorgt, dass wir uns sehr wohl fühlten. Für Frühstück war gesorgt, Wein und andere Getränke waren reichlich vorhanden. Die Gastgeberin war immer zu erreichen, wir konnten aber völlig selbständig sein. Der eigene Zugang ,der ""rest room"" und das große Zimmer haben uns gefallen, allerdings war es etwas dunkel. Die Lage war sehr ruhig und die Umgebung hat uns  sehr gefallen."
86185,37537838,2015-07-07,6659869,Keri,"Jane was the perfect host. Available and around, gave my family a lovely stay. They are vegan; vegan pastries and fresh fruit and nut bars in the room. Seltzer water in the fridge. Jane was so accommodating that instead of coming to my house after my roommate was out of town: they decided to stay with Jane.  She made us all feel so welcome.  "
86185,39288226,2015-07-22,17528907,Timothy,Great experience and recommendations! Loved the food and bottle of champagne
86185,40956797,2015-08-03,37274970,Lara,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Jane's Airbnb. She owns a charming house in a beautiful area of West Seattle. (Safe area, short walk to the beech) Jane gave us plenty of delicious snacks and drinks. 
We had a few short and sweet interactions with Jane and her husband. One night, I was about to rush out to a local grocery because I forgot to pack a toothbrush. Jane's husband caught wind of this and gave me a brand new toothbrush.  "
86185,43272110,2015-08-18,28225224,Tania,"Jane's mid-century modern home is a wonderful place to stay. The landscaping was our favorite part with the paver stones and beautiful design of plants. Jane provided us with snacks, wine and more to make our stay even more comfortable. The location is just a few blocks from the beach where you can enjoy delicious food, fishing, kayaking and jump the ferry to downtown! I highly recommend Jane's home to anyone making a trip to Seattle."
86185,46192333,2015-09-08,41420269,Adrian,"Jane's place was exactly as listed and very clean. I was very happy to be able to spend a couple nights at her place. She was nice enough to answer the door after I got to her place late. She is very hospitable and laid out snacks for us, even spending time to suggest places of interest and tell us a little bit about herself. This made me feel safe with the knowledge that I'm actually staying with a really nice person.

Don't worry if the neighborhood is dark at night, the people there just love the peace and quiet. If you need to pick up anything, there's a good number of shops just 5 minutes away.

Overall, if you are looking for a quiet, clean place to stay outside the city but still just 10 minutes drive from all the hustle and bustle, then I'd definitely recommend Jane's place!"
86185,48919736,2015-09-29,43380092,Matthew,"Jane was the sweetest person, very welcoming and accommodating.  My girlfriend and I much appreciated her flexibility and assistance settling in.  The room was comfortable and had an awesome big screen TV, I got to watch some football on.

The beach was a little bit more difficult to get to than I had hoped, (hills and curved streets... ect) felt like more of a 1-2mile walk, better to just uber.  Another downside was the location of the room (next to the garage and under the living room) we woke up a few time to footsteps above and or opening garage/car starting in the early morning.

Big plus was Jane referred us to a local spot for breakfast called the ""admiral Bird"" that was awesome and soon became our go to place in your morning."
86185,51308744,2015-10-19,17625053,Susana,"Jane was wonderful, quick to respond, and very accommodating. My parents needed a place to stay near me, and her house was perfect. 

She had left goodies ( fruits, coffee,yogurt, and granola) and even a generous bottle of wine.The location was very convenient because it was close to me, easy to locate and in a very unique Seattle neighborhood. 

The room is very private, which  my parents enjoyed since they needed a little retreat and quiet as they just wanted a relaxing weekend Seattle getaway. "
2944021,21530546,2014-10-19,19114349,Jesse,"Great apartment, great location, great service!"
2944021,21911754,2014-10-26,22504616,Anne,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle!!  Clean, casual and really convenient...exceeded my expectations!!"
2944021,22324714,2014-11-03,22566849,Tian,The location is perfect next to downtown. The place is repainted so it looks better than the pictures. Full set of equipments even include blueray player.  The host Doug is also very nice and helpful. Really left a good memory there.
2944021,26211191,2015-02-07,23759833,Yue,"It's an awesome apartment, 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom, 1 big living room, 1 kitchen, totally family style. And the building is in a great location in downtown Seattle, walking distance to the Pike market and Capitol hill!"
2944021,30383176,2015-04-21,9216251,Jeanne,"My colleagues and I had a wonderful stay at the condo in downtown Seattle. Conveniently located to the Washington Conference Center, it made our conference stay delightful. The condo was clean and tidy with all the amenities you could ask for. Thank you!"
2944021,31208523,2015-05-03,417471,Luke,"Great apartment, convenient to everything, smooth check-in process. Would recommend."
2944021,34634454,2015-06-10,8324446,Michael,"Becki was very communicative to set things up prior to arrival, and Doug was easy to reach to make the arrival smooth.  The space was clean, as described, peaceful, and beds were VERY comfortable!  Kitchen appliances were nice for some basic cooking.  Blender didn't seem to be working, so I called Doug, he responded right away and brought a new one within an hour or so - very kind!  Definitely recommended, especially for a conference at the convention center just a couple minutes away by foot."
2944021,35538115,2015-06-20,26933428,Eric,"This was my first time using Airbnb.  If all of my experiences continue to be like this one I'll be very pleased.  Rebecca helped me every step of the process, was very easy to communicate with, accommodating, and extremely helpful.  Check-in time was flexible.  I know this because I changed our arrival time a couple of times!  For being in the city the neighborhood was relatively quiet.  My family and I were able to walk to most areas of interest in downtown Seattle.  We even walked from Safeco field back to the condo one night.
  The condo itself was exactly what was pictured.  Spacious enough for the 4 of us.  It could have even handled a couple more folks on the pull out couch!  My wife and I slept like babies on the king bed.  Only one bathroom though so having more than 4 might cause a traffic jam in the morning.  We didn't really use the small kitchen too much since we were out and about, however we did stock the fridge with drinks so it was nice to be able to store those.  The building itself isn't the most modern, but the location and the comfort of the condo make it a perfect place to rest your head at night or relax between excursions downtown."
2944021,37295611,2015-07-06,28931953,Rosa,"We arrived a tad early to our location, but was no trouble at all! They stopped what they were doing to come greet us and welcome us to Seattle. They showed us everything we would need to know about the place and were very prompt with answering our calls only the one time we were in need of a little information. The location was perfect! Super close to our wedding festivities as well as Pike Place and the waterfront. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
2944021,40882562,2015-08-03,12134973,Claire,"We had a wonderful one month stay at this apartment.  There were 3 adults and one toddler in our group and we had plenty of space to spread out.  I also loved that there were enough keys for each of us to have one!  The kitchen was clean and well stocked - I loved the fiestaware dishes!    We were thrilled the apartment had two air conditioner units because there were some pretty hot days while we were in Seattle.  There is a great little market/deli just a block away called Pike Grocery and we were able to get almost everything we needed from there (there are two full size groceries within a 10 min walk too, one up the big hill and one down the hill).  The location of this apartment was fantastic for us since it was a block from work and surrounded by all kinds of restaurants and shops within a short walk.  We loved our stay and will definitely stay here again when we are in Seattle next!"
2944021,42517017,2015-08-14,32217659,Erica,The stay was great! We had everything we needed while attending a conference at the Convention Center. The location was ideal -- a few blocks from the conference but also a few blocks from a variety of restaurants and Seattle sights. Thanks for hosting us!
2944021,43764910,2015-08-22,34034719,Patricia,We loved the condo and the location.  We could walk just about everywhere. Great neighborhood.  Can't wait to go back!
2944021,51281842,2015-10-19,28841142,Steve,"Great place, very nice.  Close to lots of activities such as capital hill, pike market.  We arrived a couple of hours early and hosts gladly meet us in short order. Would use again next time in Seattle. "
2944021,52324278,2015-10-28,33458656,Becky,What a great experience overall. Check In was so simple! Unit was clean and in good condition. We would stay here again. Great location!
2944021,55372922,2015-12-01,44924338,Georgia,"A lovely experience! The place was very comfortable, and the hosts were very helpful. I highly recommend this place!"
2944021,57619622,2015-12-28,31050316,Liz,I liked this location a lot! It was extremely close to Pike Place Market and the freeways. Very convenient to walk everywhere
2944021,58173337,2016-01-01,48669210,Hongjian,"My family and I are very happy. A happy holiday. The house is very nice. It's very convenient. The owner is very good, there are a lot of information to me, so that we have more wonderful journey. Thanks"
9534,862700,2012-01-15,1323033,Amy,We had a great stay at the Tangerine Dream.  It is a great place to stay in West Seattle - close to everything.  The house is comfortable and spacious even though it is a bottom floor unit.  The utensils and pots/pans for use are better than most of the timeshares we have stayed at.  Cassie makes sure that you have everything you need and you definitely feel welcome.
9534,2465712,2012-10-01,1933371,Carrie,"Cassie has been an amazing host.  We appreciated her dog-friendliness, as well as her flexibility.  We have stayed in the Tangerine Dream for a month and it is a quiet, cozy place for either a short or longer visit.  The deck and yard are lovely.  The place was spotless when we entered and everything you could need is there.  It is also very convenient to have laundry just off your suite.  Cassie has been very responsive when any question has come up and has gone out of her way to make us feel welcomed to Seattle.  We lucked out to find this place!"
9534,2680793,2012-10-22,3077193,Kerry,"This beautiful, well-kept house is a great launching pad to explore West Seattle and its unparalleled views of the mountains and the Sound. It is just steps away from Bakery Nouveau, which was voted by Sunset Magazine as the best bakery in Seattle.

The proprietor leaves many comforts for her guests, like fresh oranges, chocolate, croissants and jam, and organic coffee beans with a grinder, French press and percolator. There is a Trader Joe's and a QFC close by if you want to cook. The beds are luxurious. Also, the house is all on one level, so you don't have to drag heavy luggage up flights of stairs. Overall, an exceptional experience."
9534,3217921,2013-01-02,119291,June,"Tangerine Dream is a very cozy, comfortable and located in a very convenient location.  It situates in a quiet neighborhood street but yet only 5 mins walk to restaurants and grocery stores.  Cassie is a lovely host, and very responsive. The house was in a perfect condition when we checked in and the bed is very comfortable.  Cassie even prepared some bagels, coffee, jam etc for us to get start with the next morning!  I would recommend this place to anyone."
9534,4210518,2013-04-19,3710016,Jane,The Tangerine Dream truly exceeded my expectations.  There is not one thing that I would change.  The kitchen is fully stocked with all the utensils you need.   The beds are so comfortable and the place is immaculate.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful.  Cassie was an amazing hostess and leaves a little treat for all of her guests.  She makes herself available during your stay with any questions including hot spots to visit.  I know I will return to the Tangerine Dream next time I am in West Seattle.
9534,4530319,2013-05-11,5403909,Hugo,"I had the pleasure to spend 10 days at the Tangerine Dream during a family visit with my elderly mother, and could not have wished for anything else. The Tangerine Dream radiates the warm welcome Cassie emitted when I first contacted her and when we arrived. The appartment is very well equipped, and has proven itself to be extremely comfortable. We immediately felt at home."
9534,35131630,2015-06-15,34222990,Leo,"Too bad that our schedule allowed only a two day stay at the Tangerine Dream. Given more time we would have liked to stay much longer at this wonderful place with a great hostess. The apartment is nice and cozy with two comfortable beds in separate rooms, a nice kitchen and a spacious bathroom. The location is close to downtown Seattle with lots of small shops in the neighborhood and lots of activity and decent restaurants at nearby Alki Point. We also appreciated the relatively short distance to SeaTac airport. Even on a busy Monday morning it took well under half an hour to get there. For a visit to Seattle this place is hard to beat."
9534,36196896,2015-06-26,28784116,Sara,"The Tangerine Dream was even more wonderful in person than in the pictures, largely to the warm welcome we received from Cassie. This is the type of home I dream to own some day.  My mom, aunt, and sister came into town and stayed here, because my apartment is really small and this house is in my neighborhood. Cassie thought of all the little comforts of home-good coffee, quality spices, fluffy towels, a West Seattle 'favorites' book, etc. And the backyard garden oasis is beyond relaxing. They're already asking when they can come back to visit (and stay here). A fantastic"
9534,40174425,2015-07-28,33941841,Ryan,Cassie is amazing. Great communicator and an awesome place to stay in West Seattle. Close to downtown as well as Alki Beach and walkable to bars on California Ave. The space was just as pictured and Cassie communicated all info pertinent to your stay. Fast internet too. Very impressed!
9534,40451663,2015-07-31,34841781,Gina,"Cassie is the greatest.  She was in contact with us as we made our way to her beautiful home and met us when we arrived.  She is upbeat, comical, friendly, and a wealth of information about the area.  She has assembled a helpful guide to all the best area restaurants, many that are in walking distance of her home.  It was our first time to the Seattle, and she spent lots of time reviewing  local maps with us and making recommendations.  Her home is absolutely amazing--the pictures don't do it justice!  Everything is just perfect and impeccably decorated with a funky flair. The outdoor space is also fantastic- private and peaceful. She provided us with half-n-half in the fridge, spices, cooking spray, tea and coffee, fruit...and a yummy dark chocolate bar from Trader Joe's!  The place was so comfy that we never wanted to leave, and are planning to return next summer.  Fabulous!"
9534,42193065,2015-08-11,39662054,Elizabeth,"I booked this MIL for my in-laws that were coming in to town at the last minute. Cassie was extremely helpful in being flexible and accommodating on key pickup, arrival time, and allergy concerns. We arrived to fresh oranges and a chocolate bar on the table (a nice treat!). The fridge was stocked with condiments, and there was tea, spices and coffee. The place was extremely clean and Cassie provided us a walk through describing rules (very few, and all reasonable) for our stay. It is a great space and does not feel like a basement! Extremely colorful and the french doors opening up onto the patio provided great air flow throughout the apartment. The neighborhood was great- just a few blocks from the Junction and a free shuttle to get to the water taxi that takes you downtown! My in-laws had a great time and this place helped make their stay in Seattle extra special."
9534,44256622,2015-08-24,19190443,Klaus,"Staying at Cassies place, the Tangerine Dream, was a wonderfull start into our vacation. Everthin in the appartment is done with love, you can see that on the small details of the decoration.
Everthin is there what you need.
It is easy to get to Seattle with the water taxi.
E loved beeing there and can recommend this place to our friends."
9534,45120488,2015-08-31,39636766,Steve & Lori,"We had an amazing stay at the Tangerine Dream, it was perfect from start to finish. Cassie is an incredible host! We loved the beautiful house. There is a huge master bedroom with a walk in closet & very comfortable beds. The pretty tiled bathroom is stocked with soaps, shampoo & much more. The tub/shower combo is great! The adorable well designed kitchen is wonderful too. Cassie left us fresh flowers, a delicious fruit basket & a yummy chocolate bar. It is stocked with gourmet spices, teas, etc. with lots of pots, pans & dishes. You really feel at home here if you want to cook or entertain. Great backyard with a deck, table, chairs & grill. Cassie went above & beyond to provide us with bikes to explore the neighborhood & ride to the beach! Thanks for spoiling us on our first Airbnb stay, can't wait to come back!"
9534,50758574,2015-10-14,17673505,Jenny,"We had a fantastic stay in the Tangerine Dream. Cassie was wonderful to work with and so welcoming! Loved the little touches like fruit, flowers, coffee, and chocolate! We LOVED West Seattle and exploring the rest of the city. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks, Cassie! We hope to return!"
1944596,9686508,2014-01-05,10161627,Amanda,"Paula, John and their adorable dog Ziggy were very welcoming and accommodating. Their home is beautiful and my room was perfect.  The location is great; a short walk to Lake Union or to town. Paula had great activity suggestions and a pleasure to sit and chat with.  They will be the first place I check the next time I visit Seattle."
1944596,10694593,2014-03-03,12168059,Jesse,"Paula was a great, accommodating host - and the room and house were very nice. Perfect for what we needed (quick 1-night stay for a wedding). She gave me a thread and needle when I needed to make a quick repair to a button - and even offered to sew it back on for me!"
1944596,13579356,2014-05-31,9518240,Eric,"Paula and John were great hosts for my 3-week stay.  Their place is located in townhouse-like development that's one block away from Lake Union in the Eastlake Neighborhood of Seattle.  The room was nicely furnished and had its own entrance to a private bathroom.  It's a small room (not much more than the picture) but it was enough to store my 2 suitcases worth of stuff for 3 weeks while I started a new job in Seattle.

The house itself is nicely decorated and there's a small kitchen that's very well organized and appointed.  I made coffee every morning (K-Cups and machines provided) and cooked larger meals on the weekend.  

Their location in Eastlake was perfect for me.  It's 2 miles from my office in South Lake Union and accessible via bus.  Also, there's plenty of quiet roads to walk or run along that are especially pretty at dusk. As for nightlife, Eastlake Ave is located 2 blocks up a hill, and offers a nice mix of restaurants, bars, and cafes (2 of each) within a 5 min walk.

They have a medium-sized dog named Ziggy that has a boat-load of energy.  I recommend that you be comfortable with dogs when considering this location.  He's a lot of fun, but will definitely come to say hi if you're walking in the door.

Lastly, Paula and John were great hosts.  They were friendly and very helpful throughout my entire stay.  I look forward to keeping in touch with them as I settle into Seattle."
1944596,13720567,2014-06-02,130500,Marna,We thoroughly enjoyed our too brief stay in this beautiful home and interesting neighborhood with friendly and hospitable hosts.  All our travel needs were provided without our even needing to ask. Recommend highly without hesitation.
1944596,14207193,2014-06-14,4011273,Dennis,Very nice place/location a block from a houseboat row on Lake Union. Hosts were very accommodating and I enjoyed hanging out with their dog. 
1944596,14444778,2014-06-19,15935493,Maiken,"I live close to Paula but needed a place to stay while I lent my own place to visitors from overseas. Paula is located on one of the nicest streets of our neighborhood - right by Lake Union and one of the famous Seattle house boat communities. The house/room itself is lovely - quiet, clean, cozy and equipped with everything a visitor might need. Paula and her family (including Ziggy the dog) - were extremely welcoming and accommodating. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
1944596,15054661,2014-07-01,14483599,Julie,Paula has a very lovely and comfortable home.  She provides all the basic necessities for one's stay.  The place is conveniently located.  Downtown can be reached on foot or by using public transport.  
1944596,15223844,2014-07-05,4365823,Michiko,"I reserved Paula's place for my sister who was from Japan. She had a relaxed and comfortable time there because of Paula and John's kindness hospitalities. 

The house was nice and really clean!! Paula provided everything my sister needed. She was able to have a good coffee and choices of teas whenever she wanted in the bed room. 

The place is located in one of the safest neighborhoods in Seattle and very convenient to downtown and University of Washington. My sister enjoyed walking along the Lake Union everyday."
1944596,15264561,2014-07-06,3075974,Roy,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! Paula and her husband went out of there way to ensure we'd have parking on arguably one of the busiest weekends (especially in that area) in Seattle, helped us out with public transportation, and provided us with  everything we needed to have a very clean, stocked, and relaxing stay. The bathroom has everything you need, the room was the perfect size, and the house was beautiful. My girlfriend especially loved that they had a Keurig IN the room as well. The location can't get much better either, 10-15 minute bus ride to downtown, a block or two from Lake Union, and we felt so safe and welcome in the neighborhood, as it has a very community based feeling- Also, Paula and her husband were a pleasure to meet and communicate with throughout the whole stay. Thanks for making our stay amazing Paula!"
1944596,15913432,2014-07-18,3649801,Rachelle,"Have stayed with Paula a couple times.  Very comfortable room, great hosts, wonderful neighborhood.  Very welcoming environment. Really enjoyed having a cup of tea in the evening and the the deck for enjoying.  "
1944596,16255629,2014-07-24,16648077,Amina,"Our stay with Laura and Nick was quite lovely. They have an immaculate house, and were both very warm and welcoming. We didn't see them apart from checking in, but the room was perfect and in a cute neighborhood, not too far from a bus stop, which was great. Overall we had a positive experience there and would recommend it to anyone interested in staying in that area! "
1944596,16785675,2014-08-02,590762,Julia,"Paula, her husband, and their dog, Ziggy, are great hosts! The place is convenient to many of Seattle's attractions, the room and bathroom are extremely clean, and a handy travel toiletry kit is generously provided. Would absolutely stay here again!"
1944596,19780943,2014-09-18,2448093,Ted,I really enjoyed my stay at Paula and John's.  Paula was very accommodating. The room was cozy and bed was very comfortable and in a quiet location.  Having a private bathroom made it feel quite luxurious for a airbnb stay.
1944596,23543442,2014-12-04,6539706,Deborah,Very nice neighborhood. Quiet. Hosts were friendly. 
1944596,25015916,2015-01-05,3649801,Rachelle,"Have stayed with Paula several times.  Paula is always welcoming, my room is perfect with tea and coffee available.  Wonderful, quiet, safe neighborhood.  Highly recommend this stay.  "
1944596,28359173,2015-03-22,7608129,Sarah,"What a great place! Paula and I never had the opportunity to meet in person, but just through our texting communication I felt as though we were already friends! The room was perfect, the house was beautiful, and the neighborhood felt safe. And a bonus was the parking was easy! Paula gave us a parking pass which was much appreciated! Thank you Paula, we loved your place! Hope to meet you in person next time! We will hope to stay with Paula when we return to the big city! "
1944596,28750973,2015-03-29,29645489,Cheng,"I was arriving late (after 7 P.M.) but was able to let myself in, thanks to Paula. (She set a password for me at the front door.) The location is easy to find and there is an excellent brunch place across the street. (Try the Farmer on the breakfast menu.)

We did not have a lot of time to chat because both of us have a busy schedule the next day. But Paula and her husband are very kind to me. They let me use their washing machine and I slept in the next day without any disturbance.

The house is very very nice! I have my own bathroom and it is clean and in order. I love my blanket specifically as it is so soft that I wish to buy one for myself.

Hope can stay longer maybe next time.

Thank you so much!!!

1944596,29934563,2015-04-14,29747616,Porter,"Paula and John greeted us with a smile and enthusiasm; and the home was everything they represented it to be. We had a lovely, short stay."
1944596,35369727,2015-06-18,4186605,Lisa,"Paula is a great host! Even though parents barely speak any English, Paula was very patient and provided everything they needed.

The room was upstairs, very cozy, has its own little bathroom. Downstairs is a living room with balcony and kitchen, which Paula was very generous to share with my parents. Oh, and the dog was very very friendly and adorable. 

My parents enjoyed their stay in Paula's immensely, in my mom's words: ""If we ever come back, we want to stay here again!"""
1944596,36509946,2015-06-29,14582173,Terence,"Paula and John were exceptionally kind, helpful and considerate, permitting us all the freedoms of their lovely home to make our stay a memorable experience.  The location was scenic, very safe and convenient for downtown Seattle - 15 minute from a nearby bus stop."
1944596,36850256,2015-07-02,21846542,Ronni,What a fantastic location to see Seattle! Walked to water to see houseboats and great restaurants.  Took a short Uber ride in to Seattle Center and saw the whole city. Room was clean but a little small. Because of unprecedented heatwave it was a little warm but Paula provided fans. Had the house to ourselves most of the time. Met Paula's delightful granddaughter and her cute dog Ziggy.
1944596,38367647,2015-07-15,11030574,Joris,"Paula and John are wonderful people, living in the most beautiful house, and helping you wherever they can. The location is very nice, not too far from the city center and in a cool neighbourhood with cozy places to have dinner or lunch. And we love their funny dog Ziggy as well!"
1944596,39908141,2015-07-27,21442212,Bonnie,Paula and John were perfect hosts. The accommodations in their beautiful condo was great including a  comfortable bed. She provided everything we needed included access to her laundry room.  The condo is located near the water and convenient to many Seattle attractions. Ziggy the dog was adorable and friendly too. It was a great experience for our first trip to Seattle!
1944596,40705422,2015-08-02,11771652,Lyndsay,Paula was very welcoming and helpful. Her home is beautiful in a lovely area. Our room was comfortable and clean. We would have loved to stay longer.
1944596,41574438,2015-08-08,27074531,Wei,房间不大，但是有你需要的一切，独立卫生间自己主人给准备的各种用品更是让人觉得很温馨舒适和便捷，屋子跟图片显示的一样，但是更温馨，大概图片拍不出情感，Paula很热情，也很细致，会把你需要的信息打印出来就给你，我们很喜欢这里，但是去的太晚来不及体验周围的环境，但愿下次可以慢慢感受，总之是个非常好的体验，我们都很喜欢！
1944596,44628350,2015-08-28,27074531,Wei,回程仍然是选择这里，位置好，房东热情，房子整洁舒适，非常喜欢！

6066570,37307839,2015-07-06,32014407,Josh,"Gorgeous house! Beautifully decorated, lots of space inside and out, and the backyard sitting area was fantastic.  Host David was very nice, and check-in/out/etc. were easy.  Neighborhood recommendations were helpful too.  It was our first time using AirBnB and we had a great experience."
2309250,13186681,2014-05-21,2670774,Dan,"We had a great stay in Michelle & Marks beautiful and immaculate home! The house is more spacious than it appears in the front page pic: nice size bedrooms (w/very comfortable beds), and large/open and comfortable living and dining rooms. Every appliance, dish, etc., in the well appointed galley kitchen seemed brand new. M & M were great hosts, meeting us at check-in to make sure everything was fine, and they stocked some wonderful goodies from beverages, snacks and fresh fruit to breakfast items. The neighborhood is lovely, with many beautiful gardens. There's a bus stop one door away offering several dependable bus options to get around (for us, to the UW campus). Nice to have easy access to/but also some distance from campus in a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
2309250,13439302,2014-05-27,1752060,Melanie,"We had a wonderful say at Michelle and Mark's lovely home!  So many fabulous touches, including goodies upon our arrival.  And the space and layout was perfect for our family.  They even went out our way to make sure we had a crib and high chair for our infant daughter.  Thank you both for making our trip to Seattle so enjoyable!"
2309250,14814290,2014-06-27,11632640,Chris,"My wife and I stayed in this beautiful house with our baby and three year old for three weeks in June 2014.  Michelle and Mark were fabulous hosts. we traveled from the UK to visit Seattle. It was exactly as described and Michelle was particularly helpful in responding very quickly to any queries we had prior to our stay. She went out of her way to ensure we had everything we needed on our arrival. She arranged for a baby seat to be at the property and the house was home from home.  There were lots of other baby related items which had been thoughtfully left for stay even though we had not requested them. The house was extremely well kitted out with a great new kitchen and bathroom and with all the utensils you could want. The whole property has been furnished to a very high standard and we had an extremely comfortable stay here. The back yard also has a nice little fire pit and gas BBQ. We enjoyed sitting here in the sunshine whilst eating great food from the local metropolitan market. The Thai takeaway on 55th does really good food (and we've visited Thailand several times) which we would also recommend. 
We were really surprised to find some really nice treats (wine and chocolate)  left as welcome gifts. A classy touch!
In summary, we were looking for a high quality home for three weeks which was in walking distance of the Children's hospital (my work) and that's exactly what we got. I cant recommend this property enough."
2309250,15257921,2014-07-06,14301230,Jeanette,"The BEST first Airbnb experience at Michelle and Mark’s home! Michelle is such a fantastic communicator and hostess!! We were travelling with our 12-month old daughter, and Michelle had numerous baby items available for us to use. Not to mention keeping the house well stocked with goodies and necessities to get us started and to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The house is even better than the pictures - clean, comfortable, updated, well-decorated…perfect! My husband and I loved sitting on the front porch while our daughter was napping during the day. It feels very private because of the trees that form a hedge out front. The neighbourhood feels extremely safe and residential, while having an upscale market just down the street, and the popular outdoor uVillage less than a mile away. We can’t wait to come back!!"
2309250,17739692,2014-08-17,13125492,Gail,"I cannot say enough good things about our experience with the house and hosts. We stayed for three weeks with two kids and two adults at the end of July/ beginning of August.

Michelle was extremely welcoming. (We didn't have any contact with Mark)  The house was very clean and nicely decorated.  It has a lot of windows so the house gets a lot of light.   Lots of linens and towels, and stocked with just about everything you could think of.  For example there is a small gas grill on the porch which we used on several occasions to cook dinner.

The house is in a good neighborhood.   There is an upscale grocery store, the Metropolitan Market, in walking distance and there is easy access to the Burke-Gilman trail.

There were lots of goodies for us on arrival.  We sat down and had some bagels and cream cheese after a long flight with two hungry kids.

Michelle also went out of her way to get some things to make our stay easier.  She produced a couple of beach towels that our kids could use for their summer camps.  She also found bikes and helmets for us all so we could bike to work and camp.  We did this for the first week, but then we decided the Burke-Gilman trail was not safe for our six year old - some people go *really* fast.  So we started taking the bus, which stops right in front of the house.

The only thing that was not perfect was that the house can get hot if Seattle has a heat wave.  For regular Seattle weather there is no problem and even when it goes up to the mid eighties it works out ok.  You can run the fans to get the cool air into the house overnight and then close up the house and draw the curtains during the day.  This keeps the house in the low - mid seventies.   It doesn't work quite as well when it goes into the upper eighties and nineties which happened several times during our stay.  So if you are heat sensitive and it is a particularly hot summer, this is something to think about.  

Overall it was a great experience,  and we are hoping to stay here again when we come back in two years.
"
2309250,19267317,2014-09-09,17817879,Anne,"The neighborhood is fun and walk-able.  We went on some great runs in the morning.  It is also close to downtown and UW, which is nice for sightseeing. The accommodations exceeded all expectations.  Michelle and Mark keep a really clean house with the comforts of a hotel (dish soap, laundry soap, hand soap, bedding, towels ....everything was there!).  The beds were super comfortable.  I was beyond impressed and so was my family.  I am hoping we can stay here again in the future and I would recommend this home to all my friends and family.  It is definitely worth the price!!"
2309250,19438922,2014-09-12,3156982,Alana,"Michelle and Mark 's sweet bungalow is an incredible find. Not to mention that these two hosts know exactly what they're doing. My colleague and I stayed here for two nights while we were in town for business - initially we couldn't find a hotel that had availability, but now we're so glad we didn't!

Michelle and Mark's place has 3 huge bedrooms with beds that we both swore were more comfortable than a hotel's. They left us bananas and bread and coffee and cream and eggs and all sorts of other sweet amenities that we definitely appreciated and that made our mornings so much easier. They also offered us their bikes! The street they live on is quiet and it's in a beautiful neighborhood with plenty of great restaurants within a couple of blocks. They were incredibly accommodating and let us leave our bags at the house for the day before we left for the airport. I hope their place is free the next time I come to Seattle. This place is a gem!!"
2309250,19649747,2014-09-15,2414525,Nate,"My stay at Michelle and Mark's lovely house was nothing short of incredible. Their house was comfortable and in a great location, with proximity to the city, restaurants, shops, parks, and the university, but still quiet and out of the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle. Michelle and Mark were perfect hosts - they were incredibly communicative and accommodating while I was arranging my stay and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. From a personalized note with house instructions and recommendations of local attractions to a basket of snacks and a welcome basket which included a nice bottle of wine and a package of smoked salmon, they went well above and beyond the call of duty to make my Seattle experience the best it could possibly be.

The house itself was meticulously clean and well-kept. The kitchen was outfitted with everything you could possibly need and had new appliances. Bathrooms were complete with extra towels, extra blankets were provided for the chilly Seattle evenings in every bedroom. The Sawyers have thought of everything!

After staying at the Warm & Cozy Wedgewood Farmhouse, I can't imagine staying anywhere else. A perfect place to stay for business or vacation. I couldn't recommend the house or the caring owners of the property more."
2309250,20884854,2014-10-06,30911,Deann,Everything was exactly as pictured on the site!!  Michelle was very welcoming and helpful!!  Thank you very much - we loved our stay!!  We will be back!!
2309250,26104493,2015-02-03,1089961,Megan,"Michelle and Mark have a gorgeous gem in the middle of a great neighborhood. All our dealings with them were friendly, helpful, accommodating, timely and delightful!
We arrived late at night with 3 tired children and they had left us a personalized welcome package filled with delicious goodies, snacks and even a bottle of wine! (Not to mention the fridge stocked with essentials) The house is impeccable and the interior decorating beautiful. It is stocked with everything you could possibly need from state of the art appliances to a ""minibar""  of cosmetics. Even though it is on a busy street it is in a great neighborhood and close to everything.

Michelle and Mark have thought of everything to make your stay easy, memorable and happy! Thank you so much - but for the Seahawks loss our stay was flawless ;)"

Everything was clean and beautiful, the hosts M&M definitely made us feel welcomed (even extending an offer for some baby related items should we need them), and the location was so ideal for what we wanted out of our Seattle trip. Everything we could possibly need to cook dinner's was provided for in the kitchen and the house is very kid friendly since it's all on one level. The three rooms were decorated beautifully and it was fun to see the little touches added in each of them. We would definitely stay here again should we visit Seattle in the future!"
2309250,29861113,2015-04-13,15207038,Mel,"Michelle and Mark were awesome from the start. Very responsive and careful in their instructions.
The house is beautiful and wonderfully furnished.
Lovely garden outfront and warmly decorated inside, making it all very comfortable. Cosy backporch too!
Mark came over the day we arrived with groceries, even tho the fridge and welcome basket was already really well-stocked! That was such a lovely touch.
Great location too! With a bus-stop right out front.
We highly recommend a stay here. It's truly as warm & cozy as it could be in Seattle."
2309250,30068073,2015-04-17,25934349,Braden,"Michelle and Mark have created such a wonderful nest.  We were in Seattle for a few days with our 9-month-old and 2.5-year-old, and their home was impeccably clean and comfortable, which is especially important when traveling with little ones!  We had everything we needed for our stay, plus some lovely extras that made us feel well taken care of (organic milk for our toddler, a bottle of wine for us, a nice supply of coffee and snacks . . . we appreciated every little detail).  Even though the house is on a fairly busy street, the foliage out front helped to provide privacy, and we felt secure.  We knew Michelle and Mark were close by if we needed anything, but they thought of it all.  We hope to come back!  "
2309250,31956821,2015-05-12,24068469,Matthew,"This is a great place and we hope to stay here again. 
Imagine your most thoughtful and stylish friend had a nice house in a great location of Seattle and then asked you to come and live in it like you owned it for a week or two. 
From the time we walked in we knew this would be a good trip. Chocolates on our pillows, comfy beds, bagels and ream cheese and coffee and cream to get us started, and a great welcome basket were all great touches. The house looks awesome with nice updates and decorating. The neighborhood is full of great local shops and local cafes/restaurants and your close to major chain shopping and two grocery stores. It was simple to hit the intestate and head downtown or out of town. 
Really, it's a great house and a great value."
2309250,34255433,2015-06-06,26154150,Mark - Chris,"How can you describe something that is perfect? 

The house had so much attention to detail for their guests and the thoughtfulness put into every aspect.  

All the privacy you want when on vacation yet the hosts were available if we needed anything! 

Great house 10 of 10 and the hosts also 10 of 10. 

Neighborhood is quiet yet close to everything you could want. This place is the best kept secret in Seattle.

The backyard was perfect for the kids to run around in while we cooked and unpacked.  Plenty of personal touches and a cute little garden with tomatoes and basil really made the place shine.  We will most definitely be looking forward to staying here on our next trip to Seattle."
2309250,41920558,2015-08-10,5642795,Leslie,"We had a wonderful stay! Michelle and Mark made us feel very welcome. We appreciated their kind note, book of information, and the food and drinks that they left for us. The house was lovely--beautifully designed and spacious. The beds were very comfortable; all of us slept well. We really liked the neighborhood; we explored a couple of nearby restaurants, and it was easy for us to access many parts of Seattle. We had a fantastic experience and we hope that we can stay here again during our next trip to Seattle!"

We will be telling our friends about this place and to walk 2 blocks to the delicious pizza place or to the grocery for birthday cake at 5am!"
2309250,51540791,2015-10-21,43351211,Bethany,"This is the second time we have stayed here, and it has been a pleasant experience both times. The hosts are welcoming, and what we find most unique about this house is that the hosts seem to pay attention to the details. The updates and improvements to the home are high quality and well thought out. The hosts provide many things you might need but don't want to bring yourself. The house it a great proximity to Seattle Children's Hospital. My only complaint is that the driveway is really narrow, so rent a Mini instead of a minivan. :)"
8301680,55201533,2015-11-29,44960720,Wendy And Jake,"The listing description was just as described.  It was a quiet neighborhood that let us sleep well.  It is close to many restaurants and Discovery Park.  Beautiful, comfortable place.
"
6214517,35221766,2015-06-16,31248080,Osazonamen,"Dennis was easy reached and helpful.  The view was just as described and wonderful.  My family and I were the first occupants in this newly remodeled unit and it seemed as though the remodel was a bit rushed because there were a few issues.  Although Dennis fully disclosed these issues, they were somewhat distracting and inconvenient.     "
6214517,35665678,2015-06-21,30645683,Cathy,The apartment remodel was completed just before we arrived.  It is beautiful and the location is great.  We plan on staying here in the future.
6214517,36109419,2015-06-25,5982158,Maureen,Dennis a great host and responsive to our questions and needs. The listing was very accurate. The neighborhood was quaint and quiet. You felt like a true local when staying there.
6214517,36801796,2015-07-01,34958806,Jake,"We really enjoyed our stay at Dennis' new 1 BR apartment in Portage Bay.  Our stay there was relaxing and had plenty of room for my wife, son and I.  The apartment is brand new and well (tastefully) furnished including a separate laundry room in the unit.  Dennis really strives to give a five star experience- for example, a comfortable mattress, a well stocked kitchen utensils and appliances TV with HD cable and some premium channels. He has also provided detergent for both the laundry and the dishwasher, soap/shampoo/conditioner in the kitchen and bathroom, floor fan and extra blankets, pillows.

Parking was easy and location is close to the University Village shopping center- very convenient.  The view of the lake and watching boats go by from the morning into the evening was very relaxing and enjoyable.

Dennis was always very prompt to reply to our questions over email, phone and text.   We would definitely stay again!
"
6214517,37317061,2015-07-06,33079857,Eric,"Wow, is all we can say. What a great apartment and the price was very manageable (and worth it). We stayed 5 nights and everything about the place is perfect. The kitchen is large and accommodating, the bed in the bedroom is super comfortable and our 15 year old son was plenty comfy on the couch/futon. The place is extremely clean and decorated well, I thought I wouldn’t like the chairs in the living room but they are comfortable to sit in. I wouldn’t stay here with more than 3 or 4 people but it was perfect for my wife, son and I. The pictures are accurate and the deck is beautiful. The front windows are gorgeous with nice blinds to shut out the summer heat. The bathroom is huge and well stocked with towels etc. The apartment had everything we needed including a hairdryer and iron which I was not sure it would have when we left home. This is the first AirBNB type of place we’ve ever stayed in and boy did we choose wisely. I’m not sure I’ll ever stay in another hotel again after the wonderful experience we had in Seattle. We did laundry while we were there which was very convenient. The wireless high speed Internet worked great and though we didn’t watch much TV it was nice to have it there along with it being cable and all. We ate excellent breakfasts’ each morning before going out to explore Seattle, and stayed in and cooked a full dinner one evening. Very short walk to both Portage Bay and Lake Union and even to the University of Washington. We rented kayaks across the bay at Agua Verde and kayaked around Portage Bay and over to the Washington Park Arboretum, do it if you have time. We also ate at Agua Verde and it was a good meal. We were there for the 4th of July and the fireworks show over Lake Union was awesome! I wish we could come back and stay at this apartment every 4th of July, then again maybe we will."
6214517,38737974,2015-07-18,34284417,William,"Dennis was a greast host...since this was my first experience with airbnb, I had many questions/concerns. Dennis responded to my e-mails quickly and made me feel comfortable proceeding with the process of renting his unit. The unit was recently remodeled with upgades in the kitchen and bathroom which made our stay enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised that the unit was stocked with sundry items such as shampoo, conditioner and laundry soap.The kitchen was stocked with all the utensils you would need to cook meals.

The neighborhood seemed safe and the unit was centrally located with a view of the bay. "
6214517,39286292,2015-07-22,34438487,Eugene,"Very nice space. Decorated nicely, well equipped. Beautiful views of the bay. Quiet out-of-the-way area."
6214517,42669167,2015-08-15,32960862,Richard,"My family and I had a wonderful time staying in Dennis' place. The apartment was just as good as the photos Dennis' posted on the website. Last but not least, the apartment was conveniently located within 5 to 15 minutes from tourist attractions like University of Washington, Pike Place Market. Highly recommend Dennis' apartment to those who are planning to travel to Seattle."
6214517,42997976,2015-08-16,30222637,Scotland,This is a great stay. A very clean and well decorated space with a nice view. I will return next time in the area. Dennis was very responsive and accommodating.
6214517,44436253,2015-08-26,38340474,Craig,Amazing view. The location was perfect. You can get to anywhere you want in Seattle in minutes. No hotel can compare. Super clean and great modern feel.  My wife and daughter didn't want to leave. Dennis was great. I sent him a question and got a response in one minute. 100% as advertised. 
6214517,44781362,2015-08-29,21923584,Karri,"It was a pleasure to stay at this tucked away spot with a terrific view of Portage bay.  The bed was spectacularly firm, just to my liking. While there are neighbors, I never saw them and only rarely heard footfalls from above.  The space is perfect as a work room and the TV served as a large monitor after attaching it to my laptop with an HDMI cable I brought with me.  Proximity to the U Dist, Capital Hill and Eastlake makes dining out that much easier, though the kitchen is reasonably stocked should you wish to cook yourself. I look forward to staying here again. "
6214517,47050279,2015-09-15,25783796,Dean,"Dennis's place has an amazing view, as shown in pictures. My family loves the view looking out to Portage Bay. The apartment is newly renovated with high end materials and very functional layout. Dennis did a great job writing a house manual that tells everything you need to know. This would be my place if I ever move to Seattle. The location is close to all the major spots for tourist. Everything is less than 20 min drive. There is a bus line in front of the place but we never used it. The check-in and check-out process are efficient because he has a lockbox installed. Overall we had a wonderful experience and Dennis always available to answer questions. I would recommend his place to any other members."

Dennis was very friendly,If I the opportunity came up again, I would definitely stay in Dennis' apartment again."
6214517,51497806,2015-10-20,46326597,Laura,"Dennis was a very welcoming host for our stay at his AirBnB. The apartment was just as it was pictured on the website, with wonderful views of Portage Bay from inside and outside on the deck. Parking was easy. The kitchen was well-stocked so that we were able to prepare breakfasts and a dinner in the unit. The bed was very comfortable, so we slept well. We enjoyed the easy walking in the Eastlake neighborhood and to the University, even in the rain! Le Fournil Bakery, just around the corner from the unit, had delicious pastries and coffee. We will plan to stay again, if possible."
6214517,51939326,2015-10-25,37947616,Douglas,"Dennis did a great job communicating us with us since we were experience a late arrival due to heavy Seattle traffic. The views into the condo unit and towards Portage bay were spectacular! Lots of boat, rowing club, and other lake traffic kept us fascinated with this location. A couple times, even small sea planes flew this leg from Lake Union to Union Bay. The unit interior was very contemporary and quite well furnished. Loved the entertainment provided by the Xfinity TV system during numerous Seattle downpours of rain & cold. Very easy access to/from downtown Seattle on the express busses a block away. For strenuous exercise, we managed the 10 block walk up and back towards the very active U/Washington retail district for groceries, etch. Really enjoyed our time here. Would definitely return."
6214517,52426182,2015-10-29,9520148,Alice,Neighborhood was nice. Close to UW and being on the water made for a relaxing feel.

The apartment is modern, comfortable and well designed. The view is very impressive.
Close to UW.

Only issue: The electricity overloads ""trips"" at the main supply, outside, when running hot water in the shower.

I can highly recommend this apartment and would rent it again."
6214517,55505330,2015-12-01,9106037,Ashok Kumar,"Beautiful place with a very considerate host. I woke up every morning to an inspiring sight of rowers and kayakers on the lake outside and that alone is worth the stay at Dennis' place while the inside of the apartment is no second place to the outside view either. Filled with amenities with a spacious layout, this apartment is convenience all the way. In addition to that, Dennis is a fantastic host. I had a lot of last minute changes to the reservations like needing an extension to my stay and being forgetful of my actual check-out date. Dennis didn't mind these as the apartment was luckily available on those days and was quick to make the necessary changes to my reservations.  I will definitely consider staying at this place again and also recommend it to others."
6214517,55924661,2015-12-07,206203,Amanda,"Chic 1 bedroom has a great view and is close to everything with good public transportation. It is clean, well maintained and a very comfortable bed.

It was our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for better, more accommodating people (three words: homemade banana bread!). The house is fabulous, a true piece of Seattle history in a great location. If you have the opportunity to stay here when you're in Seattle, you won't regret it and will be staying in the best place possible. Many thanks again to Nadine and Mark!"

Their house was gorgeous in a nice neighbourhood--a really unique spot.  It's close enough to downtown and many tourist-friendly areas that you can walk easily.  Very comfortable bed and room, I wish I had taken advantage of the Jacuzzi bathtub."

The house/room is the best that I have stayed with Air Bnb. It is an old victorian style bed and breakfast complete with a backyard to lounge about with a view of the space needle! The best part about the experience is truly the bed . It is amazingly comfortable with really nice sheets :)  You will rest well and wake up to the smell of lovely seattle coffee, pastries, and smiling knowledgable hosts. What are you waiting for? Book it now! "

The pictures you see in Airbnb are exactly what you will find at this pristine home and the bed is very comfortable!!  The location couldn't be any better as it is within walking distance to great restaurants and all major Seattle attractions.  Mark and Nadine were excellent hosts and made us feel welcomed in their home, but what we appreciated the most was their understanding and willigness to accommodate our needs while transitioning our daughter into her college life!  We highly recommend you stay here while in Seattle!!"

They made us feel right at home and Nadine even picked us up from the bus stop when our bus was running late. They left coffee and treats for us each morning and made us feel very at home. The house (and guest room) are gorgeous, impeccably clean, and welcoming. I slept like a dream (and I'm a very light sleeper). Location was good -- we were able to walk downtown and the bus is convenient if you want to venture to other areas. Highly recommend to others! "

170273,689958,2011-11-03,1169860,Melony,"Nadine and Mark were perfect hosts.  We were never in each others' way and they made us feel right at home.  I actually wish we would have taken time out to plan dinner or drinks with them.  I spent one afternoon with a book, glass of wine, and the Jacuzzi tub.  It was magnificent. Queen Anne's is a great area with plenty to do, too.  Thanks so much Hucks!"

Beautiful, classy house, location is great, neighborhood too (Best view of Seattle is just short walk up the hill.) plenty of excellent restaurants within few min (make sure you don't miss breakfast at Shanty!) Free parking is a plus. I can absolutely recommmend this place, and will return here when back in Seattle.

The house itself is a legend, it's over 100 years old and looks and feels like a castle from a fairy tale :) The room is beautifully decorared, suer clean and bright, the bed is ridiculously comfortable and even the sheets - were so nice and soft :) Nadine and Mark are amazing and very very friendly and easy-going, the sweetest hosts you can wish for. The house is located very close to ALL the awesome restaurants and bars. We enjpyed muffins and coffee in the mornings as well - thanks Nadine. Overall, this was a 6 star experience, even better than the 5 star! I can't stop talking about our weekend  :) Thanks!!"

The location is great, Nadine's banana bread is wonderful, and they are so helpful and pleasant. I could just go on and on. We (3 of us) were in town on business. For the accommodations, in a location like this, it is such a great experience and value. We highly recommend it."
170273,939837,2012-02-21,1756298,Kim,"The house is wonderful, beautiful decorated. The room is exactly like the pictures.Above all, I loved the bed! Really confortable. ;)
Nadine et Mark are so kind, very friendly. I couldn't taste the famous(?) banana bread of Nadine, but I got the breakfast in ""Toulouse Petit"" which is near the house and the famous restaurant in Seattle! Anyway, thanks, Nadine and Mark!"
170273,979347,2012-03-07,1825342,Hillary,"Nadine and Mark were great hosts. The house is absolutely beautiful - just like the pictures. After reading the reviews I was excited to try out the banana bread and the bed - both of which didn't disappoint.
Nadine and Mark were incredibly helpful with suggestions of places to eat or go for a drink - also, they were so hospitable and able to provide an early check in and late check out.
I would definitely stay there again."
170273,1013079,2012-03-18,174828,Matt And Christine,"Extraordinary hosts!!! Beautiful house with beatiful room, superb bathroom, and a view of the water. Nadine's morning treats helped start the day off just right. The house is located in the heart if Queen Anne with plenty of excellent eateries, bars, and restaurants nearby. Thanks to Mark and Nadine for making me feel right at home!"
170273,1033184,2012-03-22,563916,Liz,"Lovely home in a great location - walking distance to the shops and restaurants on Queen Anne, and an easy bus ride to downtown.  Free parking on the street within half a block.  Head up the street to spectacular views over the city.  Nadine and Mark (and Stanley the dog) are extremely quiet and welcoming hosts.  Guests are invited to help themselves to a glass of wine or a beer from the fridge - a nice touch!  Highly recommended."
170273,1043173,2012-03-26,1379671,Christina,"What a great way to be introduced to the Airbnb experience. Nadine and Mark were wonderful hosts and the house is in a great location to explore the Queen Anne area and downtown. I won't bother with a rental car next time. The bed is wonderful, but my daughter would contest the Jacuzzi tub is the ticket. I did take them up on their offer of wine and discovered some nice local wines from the region. I would definitely recommend a stay here. Tremendous value for a beautiful room and your own private bath."
170273,1063994,2012-03-31,1775965,Daniel,"All good. Comfortable, clean, accommodating, welcoming, convienent"
170273,1134910,2012-04-16,1593080,Andy,"A very easy house to visit.  We were in Seattle for the ballet, which was a short walk down to Seattle Center.  Close also are good breakfast and late night dining places.   We felt very welcomed but not hovered over."
170273,1156938,2012-04-20,2141354,Sam & Ashley,"Nadine and Mark have a very beautiful home that is comfortable to stay in and in a great location to boot.  The bedroom was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was up to hotel standards.  Mark was an excellent host and very hospitable, providing coffee and pastries for us each morning.  Free parking was relatively easy and I would definitely recommend this location to a friend.   "
170273,1170006,2012-04-23,2051205,Catherine,A wonderful weekend in Seattle and this beautiful home is in such a good location that we parked our car when we arrived and didn't move it until it was time to head home! Our accomodations were wonderful .... We're already trying to figure out when we can get back!
170273,1187564,2012-04-27,1760962,Martin,"Nadine and Mark were very friendly and helpful hosts. I really felt welcome since the very beginning of my stay. I enjoyed chatting with them and I am still thankful for all their recommendations and insider's tips! Best of all: They have a great 'soccer taste' and and an 'invisble' dog named Stanley. :-)
The historic house is beautiful, comfortable, very clean and located in a calm neighborhood. I did not need my car at all during the stay: The city center is not too far away so I enjoyed walking there. A scenic view over the whole city, the space needle, bars and restauraunts are just around the corner. 
This was my first Airbnb experience. I will definitely do this again and I can heavily recommend staying with Nadine and Mark!"
170273,1209555,2012-05-01,1996486,Matthew,"Wonderful folks. Would recommend to anyone, anytime. Couldn't have been happier!"
170273,1304984,2012-05-19,1837239,Beth,"I loved staying at Nadine's place! It felt like home, yet I got my privacy. It is an beautiful house with an amazing and interesting history. It's a great area as well, everything was nearby: transit, convenience stores, restaurants, Seattle center, the King Tut exhibit ;) without the craziness of downtown. I absolutely fell in love with it! and was completely comfortable!"
170273,1328592,2012-05-22,395438,Chy,"We had a wonderful weekend at Nadine and Marks House. From the very first moment we entered he house we felt comfortable. The interior is decorated with a lot of taste. After my 20 hour flight my back hurt and I was so glad that I could ease the tension in the Jacuzzi Tub before falling into a deep sleep in the comfortable bed. We were greeted with delicious Banana Bread and Coffee in the morning. 
Nadine is a conscientious host and our communication before my arrival could not have been better. She and Mark are warm and genial hosts.
And the location is great. We had a car and did not use it once. 
This is definitely the place you want to be when visiting Seattle! Just wonderful. 
"
170273,1369738,2012-05-29,728532,Marsha,"My sweetheart and I stayed for the 3 nights of the Memorial Day weekend; we were in town for the Folklife Festival at the Seattle Center.  It was an easy walk to and from the Center, as Nadine had assured me, and we were so very comfortable with Nadine and Mark's beautiful home as our base.  The neighborhood is quiet.  The home is beautifully furnished.  The guest bathroom is luxurious, with heated towels and jetted tub.  And as others before me have exclaimed, the guest room bed is wonderfully comfortable!  We would happily stay here again."
170273,1388908,2012-05-31,2038373,Jennie,"Our stay with Nadine and Mark could not have been more perfect. Nadine was out of town during our stay but Mark was a wonderful host.  Nadine has quite the eye and I loved the decor throughout the house. The house is located on the outskirt of city center. It is the perfect location to still have that city feel yet far enough away from the crowds at Pike Place. I just wish we had some more time in Seattle to spend some time with our host. They seem like great people, I guess we will just have to make a trip back. It is a beautiful house and just the place for any responsible travelers to stay."
170273,1410429,2012-06-04,2104725,Yasmine,"Nadine & Mark were wonderful hosts, and I'm glad I got a chance to stay a few nights in their beautiful home. It's centrally located in Seattle, so everything is a pleasant walk (or a short cab/bus ride) away. They left breakfast for us every morning, and the bedroom/bathroom were great as well. Mark even gave us a ride downtown on the last day! 

If you have the opportunity, definitely stay with them at this house!"
170273,1441227,2012-06-09,1746570,Puneet,"Our stay at Nadine's and Mark's beautiful house was one of the best AirBnb experiences we've ever had, and we have pretty high standards.... Nadine was remarkably helpful in a way that made the whole experience feel more like staying with old friends than with someone you've only met over the course of a few hours.  The place itself is gorgeous, the bathroom better than you could imagine, and the location superb.  There is even a 24-hr supermarket heaven around the corner, a vintage book store, and old record shop within a 2-min walk.  But most importantly, if you're looking for a place with charm and character, and with hosts to match, you can't do better than this, in Seattle. "
170273,1465093,2012-06-12,1488174,Adrián,"A gorgeous historical house, with a great location and a story of its own. Excellent first AirBnB stay!"
170273,1490612,2012-06-16,2213120,Julie,"Seattle is a great city to visit, lots to see and do!!
I really enjoy my stay with Nadine and Marc. The home is beautiful and very well situated: Easy access to attractions, restaurants and monorail to go downtown. It is a nice neighbourhood to wall and feel another side of this city : )

The home is nicely decorated, and the room and bathroom are more than comfortable!
Nadine and Marc are good host who make you feel just like home and do not hesitate to point out things and places that could interests you!
"
170273,1548679,2012-06-24,2381014,Susan,"We enjoyed our stay at the Historic House very much. Nadine shared helpful tips about sightseeing, restaurants, transportation and more. The room was comfortable and private bathroom was stylish and fully equipped.
The whole house reflects Nadine's excellent design sense. It's a treat to be her guest! The coffee and breakfast treats were delicious and an extra treat to have wine in the evening, I would definitely stay there again, which I hope to do on future visits to Seattle.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nadine and Mark's amazingly beautiful historic home. We were immediately struck by how accommodating and helpful they were to us. Also, Nadine's recommendations for the area's  best restaurants and  other highlights were perfect ( we went back to her favorite eatery three times in two days - amazingly good!!). "
170273,1619918,2012-07-03,111494,Adrienne,"Mark, Nadine and Lachlan were extremely welcoming hosts.  They showed us around their gorgeous Queen Anne before allowing us to relax on our own.  They were informative and available but not overbearing, which in my mind, translates into a perfect stay.  Comfortable room with water views; clean, private bathroom. The house is located in a quiet yet happening part of town; super close to bus stops that took you right into downtown within minutes.  Wish we had more time to have a glass of wine with them in their living room! Thanks again!!"
170273,1729903,2012-07-17,2242950,Michelle,"Our stay with Nadine and Mark in their beautiful home was great.  Location close to sightseeing and restaurants.  Nadine provided wonderful suggestions for restaurants and ideas for places to see and things to do including magazines and maps. The pastries/coffee and  available wine were such a treat!  Our room and bathroom were beautiful and refrigerator in the room was a bonus.  Parking worked out fine.   Top notch hospitality!  If your looking for more room, be sure to check out their new listing basement apartment (we were fortunate to take a peek). Large doors provide lots of light &  Nadine's style makes this place outstanding and provides everything needed for a perfect stay. "
170273,1762611,2012-07-21,2657768,Elise,"Nadine and Mark were excellent hosts.  We loved the room and bathroom.  Everything was beautiful and clean.  The house was absolutely gorgeous.  The banana bread mentioned by other reviewers did not disappoint - yum!  We also loved the backyard and spent one afternoon enjoying the hammock.  At the end of our stay, Nadine went above and beyond by giving us a ride to the monorail station since it was a rainy day.  We would definitely stay again and recommend Mark and Nadine's to others!"
170273,1786922,2012-07-24,2148268,Colin & Liz,"We made a great choice to stay with Nadine & Mark, in Seattle. Their earlier reviews say it all, excellent! It was interesting chatting with them and they genuinely make you feel 'at home'. Nadine was very helpful with advice about transport and sightseeing. Their house is well situated in a quiet neighbourhood just outside the busier areas but with very easy access to many bus routes to get you anywhere in the Seattle area, or simply walk just a few blocks to places like the Seattle Center / Space Needle, restaurants, etc. Buses from the railway station pass within a block so you don't even need a taxi. Their historic house is as interesting and charming as Nadine and Mark themselves. Thanks, we really enjoyed it.
Colin & Liz"
170273,1827029,2012-07-29,1624181,Andrew,"Wow - what a classy place, but with friendliness galore and a heartbreaker called Stan.  Our experience could not have been better, and Nadine's above and beyond touches made us feel pampered and more like family than guests.  Do yourselves a favour anyone looking for a quality stay in Seattle - a gold medal performance."

They have a beautiful home that is very close to Seattle Center. What a wonderful experience for our first time in Seattle. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting there.
Stephen and Judy"
170273,1897741,2012-08-06,1736689,Meredith,"Fantastic house, host Nadine, and host dog Stanley!  I really enjoyed staying here--the property is beautiful and situated in a lovely neighborhood, and Nadine was incredibly gracious and accommodating. THANKS!!!"
170273,1954892,2012-08-12,2383003,Michael,We just spent 4 nights at Nadine and Mark's Seattle heritage home. This was our first AirBnb experience. The bed is very comfortable; a fresh air breeze circulates through this 2nd storey room; our private bathroom was well-provisioned. We greatly enjoyed being within easy walking distance of city centre yet located in the quiet Queen Anne Hill neighbourhood. Each morning a plate of freshly-baked scones and Nadine's welcoming smile awaited us downstairs in the kitchen. Kerry Park - the best overlook view of downtown Seattle - is only 2 blocks away. A 15 minute walk brings you to Seattle Centre where we explored the many parks and attractions. We recommend taking the water taxi over to West Seattle and walking along Alki Beach. Thank-you Nadine for your generous hospitality and best of luck with your upcoming Berlin marathon and Mark's Iron Man competition.
170273,2096743,2012-08-26,1429827,Daniel,"We stayed with Nadine and Mark for 2 weeks in August while visiting Seattle for our son and daughter in law's wedding. They were great hosts and the house was a charming and quaint. It could not have been a better or more welcoming stay. A most unexpected oasis in a busy city. We were made very welcome and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We would definitely recommend them, and hope to return for our next family visit soon."
170273,2156721,2012-09-01,1806949,Stephen And Linda,"To enjoy the period style and convenience of a great location I would recommend that you stay with Nadine in her lovely home. The advice offered by Nadine and Mark was very helpful and spot-on. Mark parked his car several blocks away just so we could park in the driveway ( even though parking isn't actually offered ) The house was exactly as described and offers a relaxing environment to return ""home "" to. The quality of the linen and towels was really appreciated.
We found it a leisurely walk to Pikes Place Market and an easy stroll to The Space Needle but it was just as easy to catch the bus in the next street, 
Stephen and Linda     "
170273,2190555,2012-09-04,2237967,Allison,"Seattle is a great place to visit with one of the best public transportation systems.  Nadine was very helpful with all of our questions, the house is gorgeous and my husband and I were very comfortable there.  We would definitely stay there again and hope to bring friends with us next time!"
170273,2261104,2012-09-11,2863041,Ron And Jan,"Nadine and Mark are a lovely couple and have a lovely home in a very convenient location.  We felt right a home with them immediately on meeting them.  The accomodations were just fine, the bed with top notch linens was really comfortable.  Good coffee was ready each morning along with Nadines delicious home made banana bread and if you are lucky you will get some of her wonderful scones too which we did one day.  We hape we will return to Seattle again one day and we would definitely  want stay here again."
170273,2296106,2012-09-15,2062837,Fran,"Lovely host, very thoughtful, fresh coffee and banana bread every morning. Nadine drove us to collect our hire car. Beautiful house, great bedroom, very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to Downtown Seattle. Would highly recommend this charming house and host."
170273,2300322,2012-09-17,2319293,Eva,Wonderful historic home and extremely well set up bedroom & bathroom.  Excellent hosts but not enough time to enjoy.  Catch a cab (cheap compared to Canberra Australia) if climbing hills is a problem.  Would definitely return if opportunity arises.
170273,2353256,2012-09-20,3285839,Rebecca,"Nadine and Mark Huck are gracious hosts. They have a lovely Victorian home located on Queen Anne Hill... a convenient location for a Seattle stay. The accommodations were stylish and pristine. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you, Nadine and Mark!
"
170273,2407487,2012-09-25,3121211,Corrie,"Nadine & Mark were fantastic hosts. Their home was absolutely beautiful and our room was very clean, comfortable and private. We were in Seattle for a trade show but had plenty of time to sightsee and Nadine & Mark were great about helping us with restaurant suggestions and things to do. We were planning to go for a walk one evening and Mark suggested a lookout spot just up the hill. It was completely (email hidden)d something we might not have found on our own! Parking was difficult but with everything we needed accessible by walking or transit, it was easy to just find a spot and leave the car. I would highly recommend this place and hope we get a chance to visit again!"
170273,2435484,2012-09-28,2925275,Donetta,"We had a wonderful stay with Nadine and Mark. The house was amazing, great restaurant suggestions and the house was peaceful. Hope to see them again on our next trip."
170273,2456797,2012-09-30,3341519,Kathrin,"Wow, This really was a 5-star-experience! Even though Nadine & Mark couldn't be around I really loved staying at their house. The location is very nice but you have to prepare yourself to do some up- and downhill walks if you like to discover the neighborhood on foot ;-) The house itself is just stunning: antique interior combined with modern and personal pieces create a very cozy atmosphere.
My room and the bathroom both were spacious and very clean. Nadine and Mark also offered some maps and additional information about the house and the area which was really helpful. I hope I can come back to Seattle to see more of this city and will certainly send a request for this accomodation again."
170273,2563920,2012-10-09,3637964,Seth,"Amazing house located in a perfect place to explore the city. Comfortable beds, friendly people. Our trip was amazing thanks in large part to having a great place to stay. Thanks Nadine and Mark!"
170273,2679605,2012-10-22,3020000,Jason,"Our stay with Nadine and Mark far exceeded our expectations. The house is beautiful and perfectly situated in Queen Anne, with easy access to several bus lines and within walking distance to Seattle Center. Nadine gave us many helpful recommendations on where to eat and where to run, and she greeted us each morning with fresh-baked goodies and coffee. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Nadine and Mark, it was much more pleasant and comfortable than any hotel could be."
170273,2745053,2012-10-29,21329,Zoë & Patrick,"This is the perfect place to stay while discovering Seattle. Neither my husband or I had visited the town before, but we quickly discovered that this house is located within minutes of all of the main attractions...yet it's totally quiet and tranquil.
If you're a history buff you'll get a kick out of the 'cursed tree' story (I'll leave it to you to find out!) and you'll love the feeling of staying in a faithfully maintained Victorian home with all modern accoutrements.
We stayed in the upstairs guest bedroom. Very comfortable and crisply linened queen bed, and an adjacent bathroom which my husband jubilantly declared to look like something 'out of a restoration hardware catalog!"" We were provided with mini hotel supplies and fresh towels.
Nadine and Mark were very welcoming and friendly, and we enjoyed coffee and juice in the morning plus fresh baked pumpkin bread and the nicest bread I had ever eaten! It tasted home made too.
This was definitely the nicest airbnb stop on our Pacific Northwest trip!"
170273,2842321,2012-11-08,1631379,Tim,"Perfect stay as always. The house is beautiful, the location is great. Nadine is such a great host! "
170273,2866219,2012-11-12,2261298,Paul,"We had a wonderful stay at Nadine and Mark's historic, 120-year-old home. They have done a great job of preserving its charm, and provided us with a nice bedroom and bath. They are gracious hosts; very thoughtful. We arrived to the delicious smell of freshly baked banana bread, made for us. The house in the Queen Anne area of Seattle is a short walk away from lots of restaurants and stores, the Seattle Center and Monorail to downtown. We just parked our car for the weekend and used our feet and public transit. Highly recommended."
170273,3508727,2013-02-10,1608733,Ken & Layna,"Nadine and Mark's home is truly a historic gem. My wife and I were really fascinated by all the original period detail throughout the home - a truly glorious stair and banister, period ceiling lamps, and stately dining and living rooms. Even though it was historic, we always felt warm, comfortable, and welcome in the home. Our room was spacious, had a comfortable bed, and useful mini-fridge. The bathroom was also convenient with 2 sinks and a jacuzzi type bathtub which was a great comfort at the end of a long day. The home is very conveniently located and walking we found an eclectic mix of interesting stores -  including an exceptional Japanese restaurant - ""Shiki"" whose fresh sushi we felt rivals what we can get in Tokyo.

Mark and Nadine were great hosts - appreciated the hot coffee and selection of home made breads and muffins which they had ready for us every morning. Above that though, it was a pleasure chit chatting with them about their home and things in general. Highly recommend their wonderful home!"
170273,3626054,2013-02-26,2143109,Crystal,"I cannot say enough about our stay with Nadine and Mark. They were such generous hosts to my family. Traveling with a toddler and staying in someone's home can be risky, but they were more than accommodating and made every effort to make my daughter (and her parents!) feel at home. They were willing to offer suggestions for day trips and provided maps and leaflets of local sights and events.  And we woke up every morning to homemade banana bread.   

Their home is absolutely gorgeous. Amazingly decorated, roomy, and comfortable. And it is perfectly located for a trip to Seattle. It's just a short walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, as well was Queen Anne. We were also able to walk to Pike Place Market and Ballard, though these were lengthy, but very nice walks.  We really enjoyed our time with Nadine and Mark and would highly recommend their home. "
170273,3861995,2013-03-22,3906861,Akta,"We had a wonderful stay at Nadine's home. She is very welcoming and nice. Her home is conveniently located within a few (hilly) blocks of Kerry Park, which has a wonderful view of Seattle. Queen Anne is a fun neighborhood to explore. It was also very easy to take buses from Nadine's home to other neighborhoods in the city as well as King Street Station (for trains). The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. Nadine even let us check in and out a few hours early/late. Highly recommend staying here!"
170273,4048314,2013-04-05,4000685,Rick,"This was a nice change from staying in a hotel as I have done in the past during my frequent work trips to Seattle. It was convenient, comfortable, and homey. Mark and Nadine were wonderful hosts and I enjoyed getting acquainted and learning more about the historic home before leaving on my last morning. I liked not having a TV in my room. Mark was kind to give me and my suitcase a lift to my office down the street so I didn't have to get out my umbrella!

I'll definitely take advantage of this as often as I can when I am in Seattle."
170273,4159512,2013-04-15,2765905,Jeff,"Fabulous house, great location, personable and helpful owners. We would stay there again."
170273,4260793,2013-04-22,5945237,Phil & Lori,Great stay. Walking distance to Seattle center and many great restaurants nearby.  Beautiful historic home that reminds you of what Seattle looked like long ago. Great hosts too.  We very much enjoyed our stay!
170273,4364665,2013-04-30,1603546,Julie,We had a wonderful stay at Nadine & Mark's beautiful historic home!  It was so peaceful! We woke up each morning to the sound of birds singing & the smell of fresh brewed coffee! The hosts are outstanding! They welcome you and allow you to enjoy the beautiful space at your leisure with privacy yet are there if you need them & go above & beyond to accommodate  you! It's truly the perfect balance of hospitality! Views in the area are spectacular! So many great places within walking distance! We look forward to staying again!   
170273,4509858,2013-05-09,6078300,Laura,"Staying at Nadine and Mark's place was wonderful!  It was everything I hoped for and more.  The house was gorgeous, the room was very comfortable and well equipped and Nadine, Mark, and the dogs made me feel very at home. Coffee and yogurt in the morning, a small fridge in the room, a great backyard to relax in and the whirlpool tub in the bathroom were extra special touches! The neighbourhood is great I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go in Queen Anne.
I would definitely return again!"
170273,4589406,2013-05-13,3940261,Tracy,"I visited this beautiful home with a friend of mine, for two days.  It's in a beautiful neighborhood and is very close to many interesting places to visit.  Nadine was helpful when I texted her, asking for her advice for a restaurant that would accommodate a party of 25 people, with varied dietary preferences.  She then suggested an ice cream place where we could take this group of teens, that was just  a few blocks away.  I appreciated her willingness to help us, as we tried to meet the needs of so many people.  My friend and I had a nice retreat to look forward to, after spending the day with these teen athletes.  There is a really comfy bed, towels that were soft and thick, and fresh baked banana bread to welcome us.  I would stay here again.  My only hesitation is that the upstairs is a very quiet space, but sound travels easily, so we were careful not to be disruptive.  If I were to come with children, I would like to look at the suite that they have downstairs.  Overall, a very positive experience, and I hope to stay again when we have more time to explore the area."
170273,4942118,2013-06-03,532429,Alicia,"I had a wonderful time in Seattle and loved staying in Nadine and Mark's home.  Our room was quiet and private and loved having our own private jacuzzi tub bathroom.  Nadine's breakfast scones were to die for and her and Mark was super great host. The house was within walking distance to Pike's Market and the Space Needle.  If you love walking, there really is no need to rent a car; everything you need is close by. This home was beautiful and relaxing and I will definitely plan to stay here on my next Seattle Visit.   Thank you Nadine and Mark for everything!!!"
170273,5156239,2013-06-16,4653743,Paula,"What a lovely house and wonderful hosts in a gorgeous neighborhood in Seattle. 

We enjoyed our time so much and it would have been even better to have had a bureau, mirror, clean under the bed, blinds on the window.  Mainly, it was hard to unpack and get comfortable and running across the hall for a mirror was a bother. 

Not to be negative, as hosts are great, but this didn't work. "
170273,5295183,2013-06-23,6374989,Liz,"Nadine and Mark were amazing hosts. We had a wonderful stay in their beautiful home. The room was clean and comfortable. Every morning there was delicious banana bread for breakfast. Nadine was very accommodating and flexible with our check in/check out times. Additionally, she suggested restaurants, parks and other places to visit. Every place she recommended was phenomenal. Since we're runners, Nadine answered all of our running questions and offered great advise. We are planning a trip for next year and we're definitely staying here again! "
170273,5474376,2013-07-01,7065771,Angela,Stayed in their double room by myself! Room was big enough for 2 comfortably.  Had my own bathroom across hall with lovely Jacuzzi bath.  House is authentically old but the modern decor mixed with antiques make it a very great accommodation.  I came and went without much need to see Nadine and Mark so didn’t feel like they were intruding. Area is very safe and lots of nearby buses to downtown Seattle.  10 min walk to Space Needle. Would recommend and would visit again. 
170273,5568526,2013-07-06,7116475,Adam,"Wonderful place to stay. My wife an I spent 3 nights here and the location along with Nadine's hospitality was a perfect place for a visit to Seattle. Close to public transit and within waking distance to the Space Needle and other great sites (Be sure to check out Chihuly Garden and Glass if you can). Comfy bed, nice bathroom, and tasty coffee/tea/pastries for breakfast. Earplugs are a good idea if your not used to city noise at nighttime like us. Would definitely stay here again!"
170273,5635738,2013-07-09,690833,Kelsey,"The neighborhood is walking distance to Seattle Center, the aquarium, Pike Place Market, downtown and more. Nadine was an amazing host who provided great recommendations and a little history about the house itself. Stay here if you want a comfortable room in the heart of Seattle. "
170273,5983904,2013-07-25,6567617,Belinda,"A terrific find. Great hosts, the type of people who just seem good at life. Really easygoing and refreshing to meet. Big cosy towels in the bathroom, gorgeous (and clean) bedroom, thoughtful little details like maps & bus schedules on the desk and coffee in the morning. The location is also a plus - plenty of restaurants, and lots to see on the walk towards downtown. We were so grateful to be staying there. Thanks Nadine."
170273,6030421,2013-07-27,3393725,Melissa,"Nadine and Mark were super hosts. They were warm and flexible about my late arrival and my need to store my bags a little past my check-out time. Their home is beautiful and the guest room and private bath combine the charm of the home's long history with all the comforts of a modern hotel room. You'll even have a lovely view of the water from your window. Their home is a short walk to public transportation and the fabulous Toulouse Petit, where you'll want to dine every morning for breakfast. The Historic House at Seattle Center is a unique, pleasant and convenient place to stay while in Seattle."
170273,6081204,2013-07-29,38099,Ilya,"This was an excellent place to stay, and Nadine and Mark were very helpful, kind and communicative. I found them exceptionally welcoming. The room and the bathroom were spotless and beautiful, and I was amazed by all sorts of thoughtful little touches. I'd definitely stay here again! Thank you Nadine and Mark. "
170273,6174777,2013-08-02,5393412,James,Great location. Great host. Beautiful room. Be sure to walk up the hill to Kerry park. 
170273,6218170,2013-08-04,1253393,Art,"We really enjoyed staying with Nadine & meeting most of her family. We recommend her comfy & ideally located home to all. Thanks, Nadine,
Art & Lyn Magill"
170273,6368586,2013-08-10,7097252,Jeff,Our first experience with airbnb was more than satisfactory.  Accommodations were as advertised and Nadine was a most personable and helpful host.
170273,6431264,2013-08-12,7366879,Henry,"Mark and Nadine were amazing host. We were in contact with Mark for the majority of our visit and he was very attentive to making you feel at home and part of their family. There home was centrally located to down town Seattle, walking distance to great restraunts, popular tourist sites, music artist, the space needle, and many more fun things to do.
Your sleeping quarters were very comfortable, and we liked the back yard for morning and afternoon treats and play time with their 2 dogs, Bell and Stan.
We would rate our first visit at a 4 star accommodation.
This was our 40th wedding anniversary present to ourselves and we were very pleased. Thanks to  Mark and Nadine!!!!

170273,6864389,2013-08-28,3945114,Philippe,"What can I say more than all the compliments that have been done to Mark and Nadine? We came from France. We did not know at all Seattle. Mark and Nadine welcomed us as friends. Their kindness, their hospitality, their humor, their availability, all has enlightened our stay in Seattle. We were happy with Mark and Nadine, and very sad when we left. Seattle, Mark and Nadine : trio of our best memories in U.S.A.."
170273,7112779,2013-09-07,2356892,Sue,"Nadine and Mark are lovely people who welcome you and make you feel comfortable. We stayed in the guest room upstairs and needed to ask about our daughter coming with us at the last minute. Nadine graciously prepared another room for her and welcomed her, as well. The entire house is beautiful and accessible, with fun old-fashioned keys and authentic restoration, down to the door hinges. Lovely place, lovely people."
170273,7229031,2013-09-11,8513856,Jaqueline,Nadine and Mark were such warm and welcoming hosts. I hugely enjoyed my stay in their beautiful and comfortable home and wished that I could have stayed longer. They were generous with their recommendations for walks (I enjoyed a walk to view the beautiful sunset and views of down town and Mount Rainier) and restaurants. Hopefully I will be back in the future with my husband and daughter!
170273,7240417,2013-09-13,7099007,Jan,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Nadine's Historic Home. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome, to accommodate our need to drop bags off early, and to help us retrieve our rental car from downtown. Her recommendation for Toulouse Petit for breakfast hit a home run. We enjoyed both excellent service and food. She also had good recommendations for jogging/walking routes. And we appreciated the private bath with two sinks.  "
170273,7435907,2013-09-20,868275,James,"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Nadine's lovely historic home in the  Queen Anne district in Seattle. Our bedroom was very comfortable, we had our own private bath, and we had access to much of the rest of the house and backyard. Each morning Nadine had coffee, tea, fruit, yogurt, juice and bakery available for us.
Nadine was also kind enough to pick us up at our bus stop downtown and drop us off at the light rail station to get to Seatac airport for our flight home.
The Queen Anne district is a wonderful location to stay in. Only blocks away were wonderful restaurants and pubs with all kinds of ethnic eating, a movie theater, and a major music venue.
A car is really not needed in Seattle, and finding parking may be difficult or expensive. Seattle's public transportation is fantastic, and you can get anywhere easily. However, we would encourage anyone to walk as much of the city as possible, and Nadine has great information available for all kinds of city walks.
We hope to return to Seattle one day, and will definitely book with Nadine when we do."
170273,7795858,2013-10-03,528902,Annie,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the beautiful Historic House with Nadine and Mark! The room and private bath (across the hall) were spotless and the bed was so comfortable, with soft pillows and a fluffy warm comforter. I felt very welcome by the hosts, who were warm, friendly, and accommodating. The location was perfect for me - just outside the hustle and bustle in a quiet neighborhood yet steps to stores, restaurants, and the bus lines. A short walk up their street leads to Kerry park, with views of the city and the space needle. Loved my time there and hope to return! "
170273,8134524,2013-10-17,6379548,Felicia,"We enjoyed our stay with Nadine and Mark very much. Their home is lovely and Nadine takes excellent care of her guests, with homemade pumpkin bread every morning. We were super busy during our stay so did not get to spend that much time at the wonderful home. But Nadine kept an immaculate bathroom and bedroom, with a very comfortable bed, even for someone with back problem. We love the Queen Anne neighborhood which was very convenient to downtown and provides many interesting walks."
170273,8231999,2013-10-21,9111317,Jane,"My stay with Nadine was perfect.  She is the consumate hostess, friendly and helpful but not intrusive.  The house is in a great location. The room was quiet, well-appointed and stylish.  I was able to walk everywhere while in the city and use their driveway to park the rental car for day trips.  Not sure when I'll come to Seattle again, but I know where I'll stay if I do!  Thanks Nadine :)"
170273,8410991,2013-10-29,5785850,Daphne,"Nadine was awesome. My boyfriend and I slept like rocks! I appreciated the thoughtfully decorated home and the care our host had for this historic landmark building. She has super friendly dogs, a beautiful backyard, coffee in the morning, and is very flexible with her driveway space. Not to mention within walking distance of all of the tourist sites!  Really a great place to stay if you are visiting the city for the first time. "
170273,8575400,2013-11-05,82658,Nancy,"Best, the location is excellent. We are definitely among the senior age group but this is so low on Queen Anne that walking to the (great selection of) restaurants, lounges, music) is comfortable.  And if you like sleeping in a place that feels like you are at home, this is it. Everything you need from bed and bath to simple but perfect breakfast.  Plus we had a view of the great wave activity on Elliott Bay.  We travel worldwide a lot and would recommend this anytime we need a place in Seattle."
170273,8719166,2013-11-13,6131299,Sophie,"Nadine and Mark were great hosts. The house is perfectly located, tastefully decorated, very clean, the bedroom is a little nest. 
And overall Nadine's breakfast are very good.
Being with Nadine and Mark is a real airbnb experience : discussing, sharing tips about both our cities, having a nice moment together, meeting with local people.
Their dogs are sweet angels.
We will definitively come back to Nadine and Mark's.
And hope to see them in Paris soon.
"
170273,8959305,2013-11-28,3402800,Scott,"Great hosts!   Comfortable and nicely furnished.  A nice breakfast with a touch of Irish Cream for the morning coffee.  Oh, and if you are lucky, Belle will greet you!"
170273,9081721,2013-12-05,3402800,Scott,My second stay was as comfortable as the first.  Wonderful hosts!
170273,9160589,2013-12-10,4160609,Margaret,"I have nothing but positive things to say about my stay at Nadine and Mark's. They are wonderful hosts. The house was beautiful, with lovely antique furnishings, and it was all done up for Christmas. It even smelled yummy! The room and bath were super clean, as though I was the only one who had ever stayed there. They graciously allowed me to park my car in their drive and leave it there all weekend. It needed to be moved at one point, and they took care of it. On top of all that, they have two of the sweetest dogs you'll ever meet. I already miss Bellatrix's enthusiastic greetings and Stanley's handsome, kind face."
170273,10055998,2014-01-27,11278228,Deb,"My husband and I just spent an enjoyable weekend in Seattle at the Airbnb of Nadine Huck. Nadine was welcoming, accommodating and knowledgeable. The house was warm and inviting and in a fabulous part of town. We walked almost everywhere. We are already planning our return. Thank you Nadine. 
Deb and Perry Braun"
170273,10449573,2014-02-19,10883741,Fanny,"Nadine is a great and nice host, their house is so classic, clean and beautiful. My husband and I love here so much. The location is good and easy to find the way go to downtown and if you want to go Space Needle and  Chihuly Garden and Glass, just take a walk around 18-20mins from the house. In short, Nadine's house is a good place when you stay in Seattle and we will come here again."
170273,13923087,2014-06-08,3252381,Jeanne,"We spent 3 glorious days and 2 nights in the capable care of hostess Nadine.  Our room was beautiful- elegant linens,  beautiful decor, every convenience.   The house itself is a an usual and interesting historic home which Nadine and Mark graciously share with guests.  Nadine's touch with interior decor made for ""eyecandy"" everywhere we looked.  The  pretty back yard with its view of the Space Needle and comfortable furniture welcomed us for lunches and evening quiet time.  The location is excellent - close to Seattle Center and public transportation and   wonderful restaurants......and an easy jaunt to downtown, Lake Union, and beyond.  "
170273,14191164,2014-06-14,15198795,Randy,"Great experience. I plan on coming back with my wife. Unfortunately my conference was so demanding that I did not have the time I had planned to get to know my hosts better or spend time with them. Very accommodating with the parking, as the Queen Anne area of Seattle can be messy with the parking.

The room and bed were very comfortable, and having lived in Europe for many years made the trip to the non-adjoining bathroom a breeze. I know many shy away from that set up, however, the fact that I literally always had the hallway to myself made it feel very much like home. Yes, I am a married man and my wife ""owns"" the master bathroom, so I have my own.

I will have to say that the only reason I would not stay in that room again is because they have a piece of my childhood in their backyard - a gleaming and well appointed Airstream trailer, just like the one I spent many fishing trips in as a youngster.

The bathroom was always impeccable and I tried my best to keep it that way, after every use, although I am sure Nadine would have tackled anything I could have thrown at her. The rest of the house was also well appointed, I simply did not have the time to use it!

Well done you guys, you have managed to create a great and very restful space for guests. It also seemed that travel time to great restaurants and my conference were extremely short and quite acceptable (I don't like city traffic).

Thanks for having me! In those famous and trite words of Arnold, ""I'll be back!"""
170273,14970961,2014-06-30,15642583,Ronny,"Excellent room, excellent location, unique house, and last, but not least, excellent hosts!
Highly recommended.
My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much!
- Raiah & Ronny"
170273,15597764,2014-07-12,17382599,Suzanne,"My husband and I were in Seattle for three days on business.  This was our first Airbnb experience.  Nadine was welcoming and helpful.  Our schedule was very busy, but coming back to the house really felt like coming home after a long day.  The house itself was very clean and charming.  Nadine really has the little touches down: high thread count sheets, fluffy white towels, a killer shower head, nice strong coffee and even a cold beer in the fridge!  
We had a great time and look forward to our next visit."
170273,15758363,2014-07-15,414239,Debra,"Great host, beautiful home, wonderful location. Would highly recommend it."
170273,16003513,2014-07-20,13571637,Dana,"Nadine was an awesome host!  She was very friendly and every tip she gave us on places to eat or things to see was fantastic. The house is beautiful, the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was great for my wife and I. The location is easy walking distance to Seattle Center.  We stayed for a few days before our Alaska cruise, and I'm so glad we're staying there again for a few days after the cruise."
170273,16219074,2014-07-23,12180270,Ian,"Nadine was the perfect airbnb host! She often went above and beyond, for example, carrying my heavy luggage upstairs after I dropped it off the first day, preparing a wonderful Continental breakfast and coffee for me each morning, and just being super friendly and welcoming. The house was also perfect - comfy, beautiful, immaculately clean, and in a great location in Lower Queen Anne. I can't recommend Nadine and her home enough!"
170273,16410313,2014-07-27,2926551,Ann,"Our visit was delightful.  Nadine could not have been more gracious.  The room was attractive and comfortable - great bed - and everything was handled beautifully from nice thick towels to locally sourced berries and yoghurt for breakfast.  I highly recommend this listing.  One note - the are on a very steep hill- makes for a great view, but a steep climb!"
170273,16604834,2014-07-30,13571637,Dana,It was comforting to bookend our Alaskan cruise with stays in Nadine's home.  Our second stay was every bit as great as the first!
170273,17118685,2014-08-07,18293712,Katherine,"We enjoyed our stay very much, great walking to many activites Seattle has to offer. Easy to get to by bus! Very quiet and cozy"
170273,18809027,2014-09-01,18674856,Brett,"The listing description was spot on.  It was everything I had expected, and more.  Nadine was incredibly accommodating, and the home is in a perfect location.  Within walking distance to many great sights. "
170273,19690333,2014-09-16,19986313,Brad,"Nadine made my wife and I feel extremely welcome. The room was exactly what we were looking for, and the location can't be beat. She gave us only as much interaction as we wanted, and made some great recommendations for local restaurants (including the best breakfast we've ever had). We loved our experience, and would stay again without hesitation."
170273,39983173,2015-07-27,625331,Yeju,"Nadine and Mark were absolutely great. They were kind and accomodating. Everything was as described on the listing: the house is really beautiful, the room was cozy and comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and convenient to get to anywhere in Seattle. Strongly recommend this place!"
170273,40538929,2015-07-31,37004444,Rob,"If you are looking for a first rate Airbnb experience then this is the place for you. I only have good things to say about staying at Nadine's house. She is a superhost for a reason.  First of all, she let us stay there on short notice after our previous reservation was cancelled. She invited us in and made us feel like old friends. The house is in great shape and is very much designed around its Airbnb visitors. It's easy to tell that a lot of thought was put into making it a pleasant stay for guests. Breakfast was from the local market a few blocks away. My wife and I would drink coffee in the mornings on the back porch overlooking her beautiful backyard. I very much enjoyed having conversations with Nadine in the morning as we planned our day's adventures. As first time visitors to Seattle it made a huge difference having someone point us to the right places to go for sight seeing and public transportation. Her generosity with her time was so appreciated and valuable. The location of the house is ideal for people who are trying to avoid renting a car. Public transportation is just a few blocks away and the Seattle Center is very close. From there you can pretty much explore the whole city. Her house is in a very nice neighborhood. We felt safe walking home at night. We slept on an incredibly comfortable bed with the windows up and were never once bothered by outside noise. The Wi-Fi in her house is very fast. I will definitely stay here again."
170273,41623669,2015-08-08,36619065,Luther,"Nadine went out of her way to accommodate me at every turn.  Took plenty of her own time to orient me to the city and was a gracious host in every conceivable way.   The house is gorgeous and impeccably decorated, and the backyard was an added bonus where I spent more than a few hours relaxing and socializing. 

No reservations whatsoever about giving full marks.  Bedroom and private bathroom were extremely pleasant, hosts were exceedingly gracious, and the location was absolutely perfect for my plans at Seattle Center.  Hope to return!"
170273,42066855,2015-08-10,34870675,Rob,"Nadine was wonderful! This was my first airbnb experience and she exceeded my expectations. The place was just as described, and she was very helpful in getting us situated and providing us with suggestions for our stay. Would stay again!"
170273,51165587,2015-10-18,2899937,Cindy And Randy,"Nadine is a very gracious hostess.  She supplied us with all the information we needed for our stay.  The house is a vintage treasure and we greatly enjoyed the opportunity to stay in it.  We walked to the Space Needle, great restaurants and the movie theater.  Also, we found public transportation to be very easy in Seattle."
3544953,16151365,2014-07-22,16332149,Jeff,"I really really really enjoyed my stay with my hosts Sabrina & Ryan. Even before I got there I had a few questions and they were able to answer them promptly. Their place is spacious, comfortable, clean and has an amazing view. The location is perfect. If you want to be in the action you can take a short bus ride downtown. If you want night life and shopping Ballard is just over the bridge.

They provided me with everything I needed to be comfortable, toothbrush, towels, toothpaste, soap, etc. Didn't need all of it but was glad they cared.  The room is big and the bed is the best part.  IT IS SO COMFY!  I slept like a baby on that bed.  I was welcome to use the kitchen, watch TV and use the WiFi.  The WiFi signal was strong and the speeds were fast.

Sabrina & Ryan helped me with questions about the city, suggestions on transit and how to use Uber (thank you!). I was even able to spend a bit of time with them and their friends, they treated me like an old friend.  And I feel like I've gained a few new friends in Seattle.

To sum it up, the place is great, location is perfect, hosts are amazing.. can't ask for anything more.  I will definitely try and stay with them again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
3544953,16238796,2014-07-23,14064276,Alex,"I really enjoyed staying with Sabrina and Ryan.  I needed a place to stay at the last minute, and Sabrina responded within minutes!  When I came in, they were very nice and accommodating!  Also, the place itself is fantastic!  A gorgeous view, clean room, and especially, comfortable bed!  I would stay at Sabrina & Ryan's place any time!"
3544953,16695502,2014-07-31,4526453,Gib,"Sabrina and Ryan were tremendous hosts and I would recommend them and their place to anyone passing through Queen Anne / Seattle.

They were very responsive on confirming my stay and getting me set up upon arrival.  The apartment is big, clean, and has a great view over Lake Union.  The room is also spacious and tidy and it was nice to have the social space as well as my own private space to move back to.

Transportation is very easy by either uber or bus.  There are a few lines that run north to Fremont, Ballard, and Greenlake or south to Downtown, Belltown, or Sodo so it is a very convenient place to stay.  

Highly recommend!"
3544953,16801380,2014-08-02,8334992,Alex,"Sabrina and Ryan were excellent hosts. They were welcoming and welcoming, and made sure that we were comfortable. The apartment was as described and the view of Lake Union was stunning. The neighborhood was in a good location--a few streets from the lake, a 10-15 minute drive to downtown, and close to shopping and grocery stores. Finding parking was also easy."
3544953,18209147,2014-08-23,20029015,Seth,"The apartment was sparkling clean, the view of Lake Union was spectacular, and Sabrina and Ryan were accommodating and pleasant.  For example, although we arrived after midnight because of plane delays, Ryan greeted us with a welcome smile.  Both Sabrina and Ryan willingly provided information about Seattle and environs.  Both were available without being intrusive.  
Our room was small, unadorned but adequate.   Our hosts were responsive to our requests to provide more clothing storage space and bedside lighting.  
Overall, our experience was very positive.  We would definitely consider staying with them again the next time we visit Seattle. "
3544953,26521835,2015-02-15,6867165,Alesia,"Sabrina and Ryan are great hosts. They are very welcoming. They gave me tips on how to get places easily, and where to shop for food. They met me when I arrived and saw me off to the airport having helped me with public transportation which was a breeze.
  The walk to Fremont from their home is only about 15-20 minutes and it has all kinds of great restaurants including Tho chocolate factory, which I loved.
   Also, there's a great view of Lake Union from their living room."
3544953,34032935,2015-06-03,26233034,Maja,"Owners were very helpful  and giving! It was clean, accessible, quite area. Lovely view, and comfortable pillows.."
3544953,35505896,2015-06-19,34782001,Shun,The room and apartment were clean. The view was great. The neighborhood was quiet. Sabrina and Ryan were welcoming and easy to talk to. I had a very hassle-free stay.
3544953,36454852,2015-06-28,35781431,Jules,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Sabrina and Ryan made it so easy and enjoyable for my friend and I! They were extremely accommodating to our awkward timed arrivals to Seattle and made us feel very welcome. We were there during an unexceptionally warm spell and Sabrina even got us a fan for our room before we arrived so we could sleep comfortably, which is easy because the bed they have is awesome! We had pretty crazy schedules when we were there and weren't able to see them much but when we did they recommended great places to eat and were nothing but warm and welcoming! Their place is very clean and has an absolutely beautiful of the lake. Getting downtown from their home is a quick 15 minute bus ride from a block away or a ten dollar cab which made this so convenient! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
3544953,38918083,2015-07-19,35110237,Nikhil,Ryan and Sabrina were great hosts! They were flexible about when we could collect the keys and when we were checking in and out. The view is even better than the one they have up on their profile right now. The apartment is in a good neighborhood and nothing worth seeing in Seattle is more than 10-15 minutes away. Perfect for a weekend Seattle trip!
3544953,39535161,2015-07-24,9412535,Liam,"Sabrina and Ryan were great hosts. Upon our arrival they were waiting outside to welcome us in/give us all the specific directions regarding how to enter and exit the property, connect to wifi, etc. Their place is immaculately clean, with an unbelievable view of Lake Union. They provided us with fresh towels and linens, and even our own shampoo/conditioner  bottles for our stay. Sabrina and Ryan were tremendously helpful in answering all of our questions about Seattle. A super kind and easy to talk to couple -- I would highly recommend staying here. The next time I am in Seattle, I will surely be calling my new friends! "
3544953,41354220,2015-08-07,34546664,Gray,"Sabrina is very nice host! I arrived her house around 5 am for plane delay. But she already prepared everything perfect for me.  Although we don't have many chances to meet, I felt very comfortable just like in my own house. And I really like her place, very beautiful and clean. It's a nice time to live in her house."
3544953,41839802,2015-08-09,105888,Jerry/Aida,"Sabrina & Ryan are a delightful young professional couple who we enjoyed meeting.  As advertised, their apartment features a wonderful picture window with a grand view overlooking Lake Union.  Their location is perfect, with easy access to public transportation and great places to walk.  The room (and bed) are comfortable with access to their kitchen & living/dining area.  Keep in mind that you will 'share' the living space with them so bathroom & kitchen facilities are left as you'd expect when residents are using them.  Also, keep in mind that EVERYTHING in Seattle is overpriced for what you get elsewhere & the same is true for airbnb accommodations. Sabrina & Ryan are busy working and playing so often, guests enjoy the apartment to themselves. We enjoyed our stay and have no difficulty in recommending it to others."
3544953,42339570,2015-08-12,38183571,Ian,"Sabrina and her husband were most welcoming, and immediately replied to my messages before I arrived.  The listing is accurate, and the apartment is in a nice building in a lovely neighborhood of Lake Union (with spectacular views).  My only reservation was that sharing the only bathroom in the apartment was not ideal."
3544953,44039119,2015-08-23,35316069,Cyndy,Sabrina kept in touch with me everyday leading up to Friday. We couldn't meet up with her to check-in due to time constraints so she gave me specific instructions to enter their home. Ryan & Sabrina are a lovely young professional couple. The accommodations were extremely comfortable (I overslept) and the view is GORGEOUS!!! If I could I would've just stayed home admiring the view!!
3544953,44539747,2015-08-27,35092296,Jm,"Ryan and Sabrina were very accommodating, we only go to see them the night we arrived but they were super great to stay with.  The location was perfect to explore the city.  Pike and the Space Needle are only a few mile and minutes away.  The view out their window of the Lake Union is fantastic.  We would go back"
3544953,45124171,2015-08-31,5593053,Alicia,"Sabrina and Ryan are awesome! Their place is very nice - clean and comfortable. The view from the living room was excellent! Sabrina was very responsive and easy to coordinate logistics with. We were able to find parking near the apt easily enough. I would happily stay here again, or host Ryan and Sabrina in our own home. Really great people who love to travel, with a great place that show what AirBnB is all about! "
3544953,48314080,2015-09-25,34782001,Shun,I had a hassle free experience which was great since I was traveling for work. The room was very clean and the view from the living room was great.
9651755,56078155,2015-12-08,3793193,Izzy,"Most excellent location in between Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle. Though we never got to meet Pauline in person, we definitely felt taken care of with a handwritten note and complimentary chocolates! She also checked in with us halfway through our stay to make sure everything went smoothly. The apartment itself is very comfortable and minimalist. The heater works great and the lights are a nice touch! The WiFi never really worked for us due to the construction zone, but there is free wifi across the street, and we weren't in the apartment much anyways. Do be aware of construction noise during the week. That being said, the apartment was a total steal for the location and Pauline was always available and super friendly! Thanks for letting us stay! :)"
9651755,56551514,2015-12-14,6165885,Adam,The room was great! Fantastic location and fun stuff to do all around.
6262987,33887105,2015-06-01,30474596,Abdus,We had a great time with Sierra and Ivan! They left notes for us when we were not able to see each other due to scheduling conflicts and were very kind when we were finally able to meet. The room was very clean and comfortable to stay in for the few nights we were there. We are so glad that we found this wonderful house.
6262987,35128218,2015-06-15,1092591,Marisha,"Sierra & Ivan were wonderful hosts. Their home is beautifuly decorated, clean and organized. The room we stayed in was cozy and just what we needed. Sierra & Ivan were very helpful and gracious hosts. We would recommend them anytime!"
6262987,35583657,2015-06-20,21968548,Clement,"Sierra and Ivan are friendly, welcoming hosts.  Home is in a nice part or Seattle, immediately down street (50 ft) from restaurants and a pub but noise is not a problem.  Downstairs room is small but clean and comfortable and futon bed was good.  You share one bathroom for whole house - which was not an issue or problem for me - but worth knowing ahead of time.  I would certainly stay here again."
6262987,36349105,2015-06-27,27478653,Conti,"Sierra's home it's incredible! We didn't get the chance to spend time with her and Ivan but she arrange everything really good for us. Most definitely recommend her home.
"
6262987,36415180,2015-06-28,2424092,Jonathan,"Sierra and Ivan were great! They are both super friendly, accommodating, and communicative. The neighborhood was beautiful and felt very safe. I particularly liked being so close to Green Lake. I would definitely stay here again!"
6262987,36644635,2015-06-29,27478653,Conti,"Great place to stay, we stayed 2 separate days (Friday night and Sunday night) and was perfect both times!
Sierra helped us with everything we asked. Highly recommended!"
6262987,39769489,2015-07-26,34700201,Jess,"We had a great experience with Sierra and Ivan. We were a bit nervous about our first air bnb experience but we felt very welcome in their home. We didn't see them much but when we did, they were very friendly and made a big effort to answer questions we had about the city. There was only one bathroom in the home, not an issue but good to know."
6262987,40279452,2015-07-29,3994559,Liz,"Staying with Sierra in Greenlake was a wonderful experience. Not only was her beautiful home in an awesome location, she was a warm and energetic host! I would highly reccomend staying here on both counts.

6262987,41946326,2015-08-10,15975725,Yimei,非常好的房东，贴心地准备了交通地图，旅游指南，房间设施齐全，地理位置好，一次非常好的住宿体验，推荐给大家！
6262987,51722690,2015-10-24,8326417,Ermal,"we missed Sierra and Ivan, as they were on a trip, but we really enjoyed their place.  their friend xxxx was there to help us with things during our stay, a perfect gentleman, i might add. 

the room was very nice, cozy and clean.  the bed was comfortable and we slept well.  Sierra even gave us extra pillows when we asked (i like my head a bit higher than most).
the house is a classic craftsman type and a gem in the greenlake area.  

the neighborhood of greenlake is very special.  pretty close to the center of town and 1-2 blocks from the beautiful green lake.  if i lived in seattle, i'd want to move there.  these guys are lucky ;-)  we hiked around the lake almost every day we were there.  everybody is into it.

there are 4 restaurants right next to the house.  we tried the pub and the brunch places.  butcher & baker was our favorite.  very good food and for super-size fans, a lot of it.

overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would do it again."
6262987,52572224,2015-10-31,38602651,Ryan,Sierra and Ivan were great hosts! They left a welcome message on the counter upon arrival and convenient post it notes with helpful hints around the house. The room is cozy and the bed is really comfortable. They left maps and magazines for what to do around the city which was a nice touch. The location is great coming from downtown on the 26 bus (around a 20 min ride). The neighborhood is great with an awesome cafe (Lulu) two doors down.
8155710,56091202,2015-12-08,21591033,Richard,It's a spacious and quiet place. Close to shops and restaurants. Nice stay.
8155710,56861695,2015-12-19,28300915,Giordon,"The host let me know what to expect on the day I arrive (eg: a hackathon) so there were lots of people around, which was cool. I was in and out quite a bit so I met up with the host towards the end of the day when I was all settled in. The listing is basically accurate, right by University of Washington and pretty much one of the more convenient/quiet locations."
4856986,40414631,2015-07-30,28318721,Trey,This place is Incredible! Even though I tried booking around 4:45pm Mar still responded quickly saying she would only need a couple hours to get the place ready on such a short notice. When I arrived she had made food for me and my family so I thought that was very nice of her as well. Her place was so cool the master bedroom shower was amazing and so was the rooftop access. Overall it was a great experience and my family appreciated me getting such a nice place for them to stay in I would definitely come back next time I visit Seattle! 
4856986,42222281,2015-08-11,9356368,Todd,"My family (of 6) were in Seattle for our wedding weekend at a different AirBNB and got last minute notice that they would be kicked out the last day of the trip because the host mixed up her personal schedule.  I was panicked and Mar was amazing...she was so gracious and helpful and got them in right away.   My family had an amazing time at her place- they would have loved to stay the whole weekend, but she just had that night available.  Mar let them drop off their luggage early before the place was ready, and gave them a great recommendation for lunch (Ba Bar- yummy!).  They LOVED the house, it was clean, well appointed, well designed and in a great location.  Mar was an wonderful communicator to both myself and my family members.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Thanks Mar!"
4856986,46174662,2015-09-08,41102311,Logan,"Mari was an exceptional host and her home was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle. Mari spent several hours before our trip providing suggestions for places to visit, popular restaurants, fun activities, and transportation recommendations. I arrived earlier than my group and Mari went WAY above and beyond and drove me around Seattle showing me additional places to explore and giving an overall tour of the city. She continuously checked on us to ensure that we had everything we needed. The house was beautiful, especially the kitchen/living room, the master bathroom, and the rooftop. The pictures really did not depict the beauty of her home (although new pictures should be coming soon). The house is also conveniently located within a mile of Capital Hill and two miles from Downtown making it a short drive/walk. Overall, our stay was phenomenal and everyone in the group was thoroughly impressed by Mari and her home. If you are going to Seattle, I emphatically recommend that you stay here. "
4856986,55021831,2015-11-27,48201178,佳玉,the house is really good. It is really clean and beautiful. And landlord is real good too. She had make some food for us. And she is so friendly! 
3177005,15071533,2014-07-01,1690134,Niraj,"This was my first airbnb booking and I have to say the experience was perfect.  In short, Ed and his place are both amazing and awesome.  Without hesitation, I would rent from him again.  Here are some details:

- Our arrival was scheduled to be at 10 p.m. but we missed our connection in Chicago and got in at 2 a.m.  Ed was kind enough to wait up for us even though he had to get up at 4:45 a.m. the next morning for work.  When we got in, Ed greeted us with a smile, handed over the keys and we went up to his apartment.  The building he is in is spotless and very new.  When we walked into the apartment, our first thought was ""wow, this is gorgeous"".  Ed was even kind enough to call a few minutes after we got in to make sure we liked his place.  

- Since we missed our connection, our luggage didn't come with us.  I had left Ed's contact number with the airline.  Ed must have messaged me 4 times to update me on the status of the luggage, again with not a hint of annoyance.  He totally went out of his way to make sure we got our luggage and coordinated with the reception office in the building to ensure we got our luggage.  As a host, I'd give Ed a 12/10.

- The apartment is immaculate.  Large floor to ceiling windows, great light, lots of air, beautiful floors and very well decorated.  Bathrooms were spotless, the kitchen had excellent ameneties.  Our 18 month old daughter slept like a champ in his 2nd bedroom.  In the master, you have an organic latex mattress that is uber-comfortable.  10/10.

- Let's talk location.  You could not ask for a better location.  As mentioned in his listing, it is a little bit loud, but the noise isn't so much from traffic, it's from the well known restaurant and bars just at street level.  Given that I live in the suburbs, it was nice to hear the hum of a city...took us back to our younger days :).  He's located in Capitol Hill where all of the best coffee shops and restaurants are.  You are a 5-15 minute walk from everything you could possibly want from the coffee shops to restaurants to Trader Joes to Walgreens.  Location gets a 10/10.

Ed also knows his food and all of his recommendations are spot on.  We were skeptical about Bakery Nouveau given that we're from Montreal, but it's the best bakery I've ever been to and without Ed's recommendation I never would have found it.  Coffee Tuogo was another of Ed's recommendations, and it was awesome.

Don't hesitate to book with Ed.  You won't regret it."
3177005,18021786,2014-08-20,17890631,Jocelyn,"This was my very first airbnb experience and it was a dream, Ed was a very attentive host from the beginning. I was a little hesitant because there was only one review so I have to add my own.

First off  the apartment complex is in a great neighborhood close to EVERYTHING. A very nice, short walk from Volunteer Park, 15 minute car ride from the Space Needle, Seattle nightlife and something to do withing a 5 minute walk in any direction. 

The apartment was super spacious, light, airy and clean we almost wanted to stay there the whole time, we felt at home. The rooftop has a gorgeous view of the Seattle skyline. There is a little bit of noise at night but nothing compared to the freeway and siren sounds I'm used to in LA. 

We didn't use the children's room but we peeked inside and it was really cute, a teen's dream.

I feel I've been spoiled by this amazing stay. Ed's photography was a great little add to the apartment too."
3177005,18327567,2014-08-25,18055633,John,"Ed's place is stylish, tasteful, and well-appointed. It is ideally situated in the Capital Hill neighborhood, with a large number of good restaurants, coffee houses, and fun bars nearby. Ed is super nice, and coordinating with him was a breeze. If the occasion arises, we would happily return! Two thumbs up!"
9015088,55140783,2015-11-28,26061694,Nancy,"Lovely home, very comfortable and attractive, with great hospitality. Muna left us some nice treats and kept in contact to see if there was anything we needed to make our stay better"
9015088,56000906,2015-12-07,50403023,Tatyana,I absolutely LOVED the place it was perfect for a girls getaway. It was my first time at a B&B so it was different but I was definitely not disappointed. The beds were so comfortable and soft and fluffy. The decor was very nice and homey. Way better than the hotel. We got parking really close to the place we were staying so that was a plus. Communication was great and she was there when we needed anything answer all in all a 10 out of 10!
9015088,56411199,2015-12-13,43203422,Di,Muna is an amazing host! She is very nice and prepared everything for us. We will come back if we visit Seattle again.
9015088,57183789,2015-12-22,30431198,Emilio,A couple of buddies and I stayed here for a trip to go to a Seahawks game and see some old college friends. Muna was absolutely incredible going through the booking process and during our stay. She was incredibly flexible and made sure we had everything we needed. The champagne and chocolates were also a nice touch! The condo itself is very inviting and spacious as we fit three comfortably and it is in the heart of Ballard. Would love to stay here in the future! Thanks so much for a wonderful time!
9015088,58392485,2016-01-02,50775511,Suzinne,"Muna was a perfect hostess for her gorgeous condo. She prepared many personal touches to the condo that made my visiting brother and his daughters feel very welcome, and certainly made all the difference for them to stay at an Airbnb versus a hotel.  The condo has a great view of the surrounding community, with a little patio as well.  The condo was very clean and well organized and we would definitely recommend her place to others."
186328,8620481,2013-11-08,9011692,Darius,The reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5874421,29883190,2015-04-13,10520492,Karolina,"Eve is very nice and attentive host. The communication before and during our stay was super easy and clear. Eve did all her best to make our stay as great as possible. The apartment is in a new building, very nice and clean with many facilities. The location is just perfect to explore the city and also local restaurants and bars. I do highly recommend this place. "
5874421,30058844,2015-04-16,28194622,Kristen,Great location & building! 
5874421,30339826,2015-04-20,30733394,Matthew,"Eve was great! The apartment was great! Could not have asked for a better experience! Eve made sure to respond quickly and to inform us of anything pertinent to our trip. The location of the apartment was tremendous. 10 minute walk to anywhere in downtown Seattle. Great little neighborhood (Belltown) with lots of restaurants 50 to 100 feet away. The view from the apartment was really nice, the rooftop was fantastic, with unbeatable views. The gym was perfect for keeping in shape while on vacation. We even got some use out of the Foosball table! 11 out of 10 stay. Would certainly stay here again...and again."
5874421,30535414,2015-04-23,31557237,Jacob,"Eve and Michael are great hosts and made everything about the stay go smoothly and easily. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and modern. The location is great; Belltown has a good nightlife of its own and is very convenient to downtown. I'd happily stay here again."
5874421,30818014,2015-04-27,14733426,John,"Host was responsive and helpful.  She met with us when our flight times changed and responded quickly over airbnb messaging whenever we contacted her. The apartment was great and was located in probably the best possible location for Seattle.  10 minute walk from westlake station (light rail), tons of restaurants, bars, coffee shots, and pikes place market, there wasn't much more to ask for in terms of the location.  The apartment itself was clean and had a nice view.  

"
5874421,31071028,2015-05-01,1417099,Travis,"Eve is a wonderful host, and her apartment is lovely :)"
5874421,31458171,2015-05-05,24048876,Todd,"This apartment is the perfect place to stay if your visiting Seattle.  Go check out all the other neighborhoods but stay in Belltown.  Walking distance from Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Science Center, Pioneer Square, etc.  Not to mention the neighborhood has plenty to offer with regard to great places to eat & drink.  Below are some of the places we liked all within 1 block of apt; 

Bedlam Coffee - nutella latte
Biscuit Bitch - homemade biscuits with honey butter
Rocco's - Hawaiian pizza & ginger beer
Local Pho - seafood pho
Wasabi - pork belly role
Mommas Mexican Kitchen - street tacos

Eve was an excellent host.  She made sure we were well informed and checked in with us a few times during our stay to make sure we were all good.  The apartment was perfectly sized for the 2 of us.  Also, very clean and well cared for (seemed new or newly renovated).  

If you're looking to get out of the city for half a day I recommend taking a 10 min Uber to Discovery Park. There's a 4 mile trail loop that has amazing scenery including; wooded area, meadows, and beach.  "
5874421,31798804,2015-05-10,17902026,Lee,"Eve was a great host. She was very responsive and welcoming. She was able to accommodate our late arrival and even offered to drop the keys off if we needed to make dinner by a certain time. The listing was exactly how it was described. The building had a great game room with gym in the lobby and a rooftop area to check out the view. The apartment was very modern and everything was very new/clean. The only qualm I had was how close the TV and couch are due to the limited space but we didn’t spend much time watching TV since the apartment location is located right in the middle of all the restaurants and bars. This could be a plus or minus for some because everything is steps away but got pretty loud and noisy. I would suggest bringing earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. FYI, Pike’s Place is 4-5 short blocks way and the sightseeing attractions are the same distance but in the opposite direction. They also have bike rentals on the street that was very convenient if you need to go a little bit further. I wouldn’t bother with a car rental at all."
5874421,33511881,2015-05-29,15539564,Jeff,"Eve was able to meet us for a early check-in.. most appreciated.

 I recalled the building from a prior trip to Seattle last year. The building is approx 1.5 years old and is 93% occupied.  The walk score is accurate and the Pike Market is 4 blocks away.  The unit was in excellent shape.  The roof deck was outstanding with a beautiful view of the Bay.  Two grills were available and a gas fire pit was going to be installed in the coming days. 

The bedroom had a very comfortable bed and there were two large closets on either side of the bed. What was lacking was a chest of drawers  and sufficient hangers. Eve did take the feedback on the chest drawer concern.  Additionally I would point out that the unit lacked AC.. .not a big deal in Seattle accept when the temps get into the 70's which it  did while we were there for 9 nights. We went to the Target and purchased a fan which we left for whomever comes behind us.
 
The unit had an excellent large screen flat panel TV, wifi Internet but lacked  cable service. Local channels were marginally received with the rabbit ear antennae. I would suggest that one carries an HDMI cable or Chromecast ( or other media ) to jack into the TV if you want to use your laptop. Also there was a Netflix account on the TV.

The only downside to the unit was the street noise and the street people located around the building. Restaurants and bars contributed to excessive noise  as did the rantings of street people. Traffic noise was somewhat constant that could be mitigated by closing the unit up ...but then you had to deal with the heat buildup in the unit.


"
5874421,33673135,2015-05-31,30715373,Amanda,"Our stay with Eve was wonderful. The location was perfect for walking to the main touristy things like the EMP Museum and Pike's Market. There are also a bunch of nice bars/restaurants/coffee shops very close by. You do get a bunch of street noise if the window or door is open because of this, but it was manageable. The apartment was exactly as pictured, the bed was very comfortable and Eve was very accommodating with our early arrival time. Over all it was a great experience."
5874421,34075085,2015-06-04,32616908,Mike,"I can't say enough of how great my stay was at Eve and Michael's. The place is perfectly located within walking distance to the Bell Conference Center, tourist spots (Space Needle, Pike Place Market, etc), as well as on the same block as great restaurants (try Wasabi and Local 360). The place is clean, comfortable and has a great view from the apartment and an excellent view from the roof top. Also, Eve was a great host with a warm welcome when I got there, checking in on me via text message and answering all of my questions before and after I arrived. "
5874421,34291675,2015-06-07,30559506,Eric,"This apartment was perfect!  The unit was perfectly clean, well furnished and in a great part of town.  Thank you Eve for helping to make our first trip to Seattle memorable!"
5874421,34855704,2015-06-13,30387323,Mike,"We had a very nice stay in Seattle. The apartment was quite comfortable and seemed like a home away from home. Its location in Belltown was very close to bus, Light Link and street car.

Eve was very helpful throughout our stay and we appreciated being able to check in early."
5874421,35210553,2015-06-16,17549826,Joy,"This was a great spot to stay!  We were welcomed warmly, and with a bottle of wine no less! =)  It was fun to eat dinner up on the roof top too.  Eve was always easy to get a hold of.  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5874421,35469498,2015-06-19,1704498,Kristyn,"My friend and I loved our stay at Eve and Michael's apartment!  It was clean, comfortable, and modern.  The building and neighborhood was nice and safe, but the location was the best part.  We were able to walk everywhere!  Check-in and check-out was extremely easy.  Eve was very accommodating and friendly.  We appreciated the bottle of red wine she gave us and enjoyed it on the building's beautiful rooftop deck.  I would definitely recommend it and would love to stay here again!"
5874421,35958997,2015-06-23,5535622,Angela,"Eve and Michael's apartment was spacious, filled with light and extremely convenient. My parents and I were visiting from Vancouver and the three of us were very comfortable as the apartment easily sleeps 3 (the couch is huge!). Eve was very timely in her responses and met us as soon as we arrived at the apartment to give us the keys and a complimentary bottle wine. The apartment has all the amenities that we needed to feel at home. Lots of fresh towels were provided as was extra bedding for the couch. There is a washer/dryer in the bathroom which is really great for short and long term stays. There are tons of restaurants right downstairs, we never had to walk more than 5 minutes to find a delicious place for dinner or lunch. In addition Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk away (4 blocks to be exact) which is great if you're like us and needed a nap between all the shopping. We will definitely rebook the next time we're in town! "
5874421,36380486,2015-06-28,31067554,Kristina,"We had a wonderful experience staying in this apartment.  It looked exactly as it did in the pictures, very nicely decorated, and the bed was so comfortable.  It was a nice kitchen for cooking our food from Pike's Market, and we also enjoyed the restaurants nearby (especially Wasabi).  This apartment has a water view which we weren't expecting but liked.  The location is PERFECT!  We walked everywhere, and it is very central to everything.  We highly recommend Eve as a host.  She was accommodating of our late arrival, and even gave us a gift of wine when we arrived!  "
5874421,36725045,2015-06-30,36145411,Richard,"Awesome new place in downtown Seattle. Right in the middle of awesome restaurants and bars, walking distance to many great attractions. Thank you!"
5874421,36878455,2015-07-02,20953699,Kyle,"Eve's place was great!  Very central, and EXACTLY as the pictures were on the site.  Very walkable restaurants (try the pizza place, Rocco's around the corner .... taste buds blown!) A few negatives we encountered were the parking issues (which is bad everywhere in Seattle), the heat wave with no A/C, and there were some bums/riff faff lingering around at night making it quite noisy with the windows open.  All in all, it was a great experience, though, and I would definitely stay with Eve again.  "
5874421,37840642,2015-07-11,30619187,Shiming,Great host and nice apartment!
5874421,38502184,2015-07-16,9266122,Brenda,The apartment was exactly as portrayed clean and tidy.  Eve met us and was accommodating with an early check in which was appreciated
5874421,38831406,2015-07-19,3932244,Eric,"Eve is a great host. She was quick in responding to any questions we had prior to booking the apartment and quick to respond to our needs during our stay like bringing over batteries for the remote. 

The apartment is perfect for a solo/couple weekend getaway. Perfect location right in the middle of Belltown walking distance to Pike's Market and The Space Needle and a short Lyft ride to Ballard or Fremont. 

Only thing to keep in mind if you plan on booking this apartment during the summer is that it has no A/C. So check the weather in advance of booking if you think you'll be uncomfortable in some heat. "
5874421,39608941,2015-07-25,31456648,Laurie,"Loved, loved, loved the space, location, attentiveness of host, and our entire experience. Condo was spotless, unique and comfortable. Bed very comfortable which is important in my world! Nice gym, beautiful rooftop and perfect location to walk to almost every tourist attraction downtown. Highly recommend!"
5874421,40212279,2015-07-29,33468670,Megan,"Eve was great and left a detailed email on what we needed to do and where to go. She arranged to have someone meet us at the apartment and show us how to work the keys (neat new electronic ones) and show us around the apartment (even left a bottle of wine). The next day she sent us an email to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. Great apartment, location, pricing and Eve was great to work with.

5874421,40722793,2015-08-02,788659,June,"This apartment worked out very well for my husband and me for our  three day visit to Seattle. We had room to spread out a bit and the price was very reasonable compared to hotel rooms I considered. The building is new and well maintained, but the best part is the roof deck. We bought coffee across the street each morning and took it up to the roof to enjoy the cool morning air. It was hot and sunny, so the air was crystal clear and the view across the Puget Sound to the Olympic Mountains was spectacular!
 
The Bell Street location is an easy walk to the ferry docks, Pike's Market or the Space Needle. Belltown is a busy city neighborhood with tons of coffee shops and food along every block. There's a real mix of restored old buildings, new condos and people and dogs.

Eve was so helpful through the whole process. When we arrived she met me at the apartment and explained everything about the building and the unit and she was quick to respond to a couple requests we had during our stay."
5874421,41732539,2015-08-09,7342705,Raymond,"Morgan was very welcoming when we first met her and was quick to respond to text messages and phone calls.  As my primary destination was mostly to Key Arena, it was close enough to walk there as well as to walk to Pike Place Market for some chowder.  There were also various restaurants within walking distance and when I needed the bus, it was right across the street, so the location was very convenient.

The place was also very clean as they had a cleaning crew come through.  In addition, they were very flexible with the hours.  Our flight came in at around 11am and they allowed us to come drop off our bags at around 12pm even though check-in on the listing begins at 5pm."
5874421,42316287,2015-08-12,3966602,Jules,Apartment was immaculately clean and had shampoo/body wash in shower.  Super convenient location.  Morgan was easy to contact and even allowed our friend to get the key as our flight got in late on a Sunday night.
5874421,42694275,2015-08-15,4811739,Lizzie,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle! The apartment was imaculate, very comfortable and in a perfect location. Walking distance to pikes place and great neighborhoods. Check in and communication with the hosts was very easy and convenient. Id definitely recommend this apart to others! "
5874421,43528676,2015-08-20,39360842,Steve,"This apartment is in a great location. Walking distance to Pikes Place, coffee, restaurants, downtown shopping, Ferries, Space Needle, etc.  The apartment is cute and comfortable with washer/dryer and full kitchen. Morgan was really helpful about changing the check-in time and responded to emails quickly.  She also brought another blanket upon request.   I would strongly suggest this apartment for those that are used to living in an urban setting. "
5874421,45255886,2015-09-01,36188397,Daniel,"What made it a great location for my husband and me was being able to quickly access bike, bus, ferry, freeway, monorail, or, just walk to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. All within a three block area.
The building seemed fairly new, unit was clean and had everything we needed. It's a west facing unit with lots of sun (when it shines, and it did one day) and views of the waterfront area. It was nice to have a large window to the harbor and watch the ferries and ships."
5874421,46887242,2015-09-14,38519159,Chris,This was my first experience with AirBnB and it could not have been better.  Daniela is a fantastic host and the location is beautiful.  The photos do not do it justice.  I was extremely happy with my stay and I recommend this location to anyone looking for an AirBnB in Seattle.  I hope to stay there again on my next trip.
5874421,47618571,2015-09-21,19151978,Alyssa,"The apartment was lovely, clean and in a great location. The apartment was vey well decorated and it was very convenient to have a full kitchen and washer/dryer during our stay. It looked exactly like it does in the pictures."
5874421,48233969,2015-09-24,8575283,Amy,"I had a wonderful stay in Daniela's flat. It was immaculate, quiet and looks exactly as shown in the posted pictures.  It fit my needs perfectly for my stay in Seattle.  Daniela was super responsive and helpful. I would definitely stay again.  Thank you!"
5874421,48897636,2015-09-29,15709005,Matt,Fantastic location.. great accommodation and overall just an easy way of visiting beautiful Seattle!
5874421,51388744,2015-10-19,737618,Gaurav,Daniela was an excellent host and her apartment is in such a great location. Very satisfied 
5874421,53898644,2015-11-14,31678480,Olivia,"Check in was easy and the unit was exactly as what was shown in the photos.  They were able to accommodate my request for an earlier check-in so I did not have to drag my suitcase around, which I greatly appreciated. The location was fantastic with Pike Market and lots of great restaurants nearby.  Communication with Jocelyn was quick and she made sure to contact me before and during our stay. Thanks for a great trip!"
5874421,54210671,2015-11-16,9669864,Deborah,"From the my first contact with Jocelyn she was prompt, efficient informative. We were taking the train from Portland and she was flexible with our schedule when it came to checking in.  Jocelyn even helped us locate a company that could help us print out our Seahawk tickets on a Sunday! After I returned  home I relized I left my make up and some medicine under the sink, Jocelyn popped it in the mail to me the next day! Great host!"
5874421,55288417,2015-11-29,48984435,John,"Everything was exactly as described and some.  Our hosts made our stay easy and simple from checking in to checking out. In addition,  provided us with a list of popular restaurants in the area from cultural food to trendy and casual spots.  What Hannah and I enjoyed the most was location! This area was practically walking distance from everything and anything you can imagine.  We took the light rail from the airport to westlake and only walked a  few blocks to our building.  During the evening we would uber and spend $5 tops.  The building was clean and modern.  The rooftop has an amazing view especially at night.  If we were to visit Seattle again, I would probably stay here."
5874421,56282802,2015-12-11,8575283,Amy,Thank you for another great stay!  The location is perfect and the flat feels like a home away from home to me.   Jocelyn is a lovely host and super responsive to inquiries.  I will definitely be back. Thanks again!
707424,3224495,2013-01-02,3023008,Alan,"We had a wonderful experience in Sheila's Sanctuary.  The location is incredibly convenient, and the house itself is great.  The house is stocked with interesting decor and an incredible book collection.  We prepared a big meal in the kitchen, where we found everything we needed.  There is only one shower in the house, which was a bit of a squeeze for five people, but there is also a great European-style tub for those who aren't in a hurry.  Overall, couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  Also, this house comes equipped with the most comfortable pull-out couch I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on (and, of course the couch is made by a local company, because, Seattle!).  "
707424,6454391,2013-08-13,5829431,Joseph,"Sheila was great to work with. The accommodations at her home were wonderful and unique, and everything was very clean and well kept. The house is walking distance to Broadway Ave, and to the restaurants and bars along Pine and Pike. Overall a great experience."
707424,7092026,2013-09-06,6090159,Justin,"We were totally taken by surprise at how quaint, homey, and lush this place is. The garden in the back is well tended and full of beautiful specimens (my favourite: the bamboo). The house was very clean, spacious, and pretty decked out. It fit 6 people very comfortably, with lots of leisure space. The kitchen had a few groceries for us already, which we were very grateful for, and her collection of cooking spices, oils, and utensils were more than we could ask for. We definitely felt like guests staying in someone's home, rather than renters in a sparse house. She was more than accommodating for special requests. The binder for airbnb guests also contained menus for nearby restaurants as well as details on sights to see. 

The location is excellent -- a half hour walk to downtown, a Safeway only a block away, and ready availability of transit. Just far enough away from downtown to not be bustling, and only 15 minutes' walk to a large soccer field and tons of restaurants and pubs."
707424,7758056,2013-10-01,6761817,Dadricar,"The house was exactly as shown in profile. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. It was perhaps the best air bnb experience I've had. I was there for 6 days and even allowed a late check out. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen easy to maneuver.. It could well accommodate a large group, though mine was just me and a friend. The only complaint I can think of, is backing out of the driveway can seem dangerous if not extremely cautious. I would gladly use this sanctuary again should I have a long term visit to the area.    "
707424,8566976,2013-11-05,9215568,Juliana,"Thank you to Sheila for opening her lovely home to us and sharing it for our weekend visit to Seattle. We had a great time there, our friends who stopped by to see us loved the house, and we were able to enjoy a marvelous girls' reunion dinner on Sunday evening. We all really liked looking around and discovering all the different decorations and touches in the house - it seemed like every time I went to explore, I discovered something new and different, and that was really fun. If I am able to get away for a weekend and need a place to stay again, I hope Sheila's place will be available, because I would gladly go back to her home. "
707424,10738589,2014-03-05,4391883,Tia,"Beautiful, clean, well-appointed, quality furnishings, very comfortable!!  House is located on main bus routes so easy travel access without a car.  Everything you need, including shower soap!!  Enjoyed browsing the unique and plentiful books and photography (would love some of Julie/a Edwards photos myself, so amazing!).  Check-in was so easy and convenient, Sheila even offering an early check-in time.  Lots of cafes and shops in area, was able to find and get in for a last minute massage just a couple blocks away, so wonderful!  Did a run down Madison to the Lake and walk another day through the nearby arboretum.  Would highly recommend.  Thanks Sheila!"
707424,12907857,2014-05-13,5126354,Jeff Stuart ,Everything was perfect. 
707424,13354648,2014-05-26,13232656,Erik,"Working with Sheila could not have been easier. She returned emails prior our stay by the end of the day, usually right away. She had a prepared booklet in the kitchen to answer all the questions we could imagine. The home was beautiful, and the fold-old living room bed was comfortable enough for my 92-year-old grandma. The kitchen was excellent and served my family of foodies well. I would absolutely stay again, thanks Sheila!"
707424,14845258,2014-06-27,419192,Keith,"Sheila has a great house in a great neighborhood.  We contacted her last minute due to a change of plans and she graciously accommodated us.  The house is well represented in her listing.  Lots of stained glass.  It's well appointed and she made everything easy, including quick responses when booking.  -Keith"
707424,15131934,2014-07-03,12737068,Nancy,"Sheila was easy to contact, quick to respond and flexible.  My sister's flight got in before check in time, and Sheila was great about letting her drop off luggage.  The house was beautiful, comfortable and in a great location.  The bus ran right by the house which saved us some cab fare once we knew our way around a little.  Some folks might find the bus noise excessive in the sleeping hours, so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  I didn't have a problem with this and am a light sleeper myself...

The beds were all comfortable, the shower really nice and hot and each room was well appointed with all you would need.  I slept on the super comfy sofa-bed in the living room and was pleasantly surprised that you could close the room off completely with pocket door and french doors on each end.  The curtain made for complete privacy.  The downstairs half bath is very convenient for anyone sleeping downstairs.

We did eat out some, but mostly enjoyed coming back to the house to make dinner and sit around the lovely dining room table admiring the book collection and stain glass windows.  This was so much better than sitting on each other's beds in a hotel room!  The kitchen was well equipped.

707424,15308541,2014-07-07,13079606,Ryan,"Shiela was an excellent hostess. She provided all the necessary check-in information well in advance, and was responsive to all questions. The house was exactly as presented, and we enjoyed our time catching up with friends on the back porch."
707424,17428395,2014-08-12,1421770,Alexandra,"Sheila's home was the perfect getaway for our family vacation. The house is very roomy, well-taken care of, and spotlessly clean. And having 3 bathrooms was such a luxury! We loved having Safeway 2 blocks away and lots of cool restaurants and shops within walking distance. Transportation was easy - any time we needed to go somewhere across town, we called Lyft and a driver was there in 5 minutes. (To get Lyft, download the free app on your iPhone. You can get your first ride free - up to $25 - if you enter this promo code when you sign up: ALWA17. It is much less expensive and much faster than using a cab.) "
707424,18405246,2014-08-26,6503868,Basil,"Me and my friends had a great time at Sheila's garden sanctuary in Seattle. The house was in a good location within walking distance to plenty of restaurants as well as grocery stores. It also had a bus stop near the house plus getting a cab was super easy and inexpensive. The kitchen was stocked with a variety of spices as well as plenty of cooking utensils. Sheila was present during our check-out and there was a minor water leak when we arrived to the house. However, a plumber was immediately called upon to fix the leak and no other problems presented itself afterwards. The backyard was great for cooking and Sheila provided us with a couple of steaks for our grilling pleasure. The rooms were a nice size and the downstairs pull-out bed was comfortable as well. Overall, everyone in our group enjoyed our stay at Sheila's home and this was a great first airbnb experience for all of us. Thanks "
707424,18937047,2014-09-03,9393419,Margie,"Our family met in Seattle for a wedding and the Sanctuary was just right as a base of operations and a place to hang out together. The basics- comfortable beds, plenty of hot water, spacious and well-appointed kitchen- are all there, as well as colorful decor and personal touches. The garden is a lovely spot for morning coffee or a glass of wine. When we visit again we will not rent a car- the bus lines are very convenient and parks, stores and restaurants are within walking distance. Thank you Sheila for making your home available! Margie"
707424,20081183,2014-09-23,13027763,Chasette,"Gorgeous house in a perfect location. Sheila's place is far enough from the hustle of the city to be quiet, but right on two bus stops to get you anywhere you want to go.  She was super quick to respond and even let us check in early when we arrived ahead of schedule. Sheila's house is gorgeous and full of personality. Very comfortable and cozy."
707424,20451531,2014-09-29,1192943,Brooke,"The sanctuary was very homey and cozy for being a huge house.  Sheila's kitchen was amply stocked with all sorts of cooking utensils, which we didn't use, but was nice to know were there.  Same with her large library. The bedrooms slept our crew of 4 people comfortably.  I slept on the pull-out couch which was very comfortable.   The bathtub was the biggest bonus.   We had events to attend in Capitol Hill; walking, it took about 20 minutes; driving, an uber car was super cheap and took about 5 minutes."

707424,33829210,2015-06-01,5058882,Clemens,Everything worked out as expected. The place was perfect for our stay in Seattle.
707424,34112402,2015-06-04,11756065,Nancy,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
707424,35670378,2015-06-21,32876157,Naj,Staying at the Sanctuary was a wonderful experience. There is a tremendous amount of space in every room and enough comfortable beds and bathrooms for four adults and two kids. The outdoor sitting area was relaxing and inviting and the owner goes out of her way to provide information for people new to the area. She was immediately attentive to any questions. First class facility.
707424,36084385,2015-06-25,12246991,Ben,"We had a great experience at Sheila's home. Her house was clean and inviting. Her house met our needs and accommodated the 5 of us comfortably. The location of her home made it easy to access all areas of Seattle with little to no traffic which is a blessing given Seattle's traffic issues. Sheila was available when we needed assistance. We will stay in Sheila's home the next time we visit Seattle - what a gem!
You were a great host and everything was great. Thanks for letting us use your home. 
Ben& Liz"
707424,38995421,2015-07-20,19741399,Karen,Everything about this house was better than we imagined.  Great stay.  Location was perfect.  Lichen bathrooms were superb.  Supplies a real plus
707424,39368497,2015-07-23,182328,Georgia,"Beautifully updated craftsman style home with fabulous kitchen! House is on a bus route, but this can be a plus for those without a car. Window unit air conditioners in the bedrooms helped to drown out the street noise."
707424,41204764,2015-08-05,33029954,Steve,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay here.  The creative and colorful décor instilled a festive yet restful mood.  The house is well equipped, including everything needed for cooking for a group, and the large washer and dryer were very useful.  Bedrooms are comfortable if a little small, and main bathroom has large shower stall, in addition to Jacuzzi bath in master bath.  Wifi worked well and the bedrooms had window AC units, which we actually needed at night given the warm summer. Our host was very responsive to questions.  Only downside may be that the house is on a busy corner, which led to some traffic noise at some times.  However, the location is great as it is walking distance to several large parks, many good restos and supermarkets, and short drive to downtown or univ district."
707424,47098644,2015-09-15,19075439,Raquel,"Had an amazing stay in this home. There was more than enough room for five adults. All the beds were very comfortable, including the sofa bed. I would definitely stay here again. "
7916754,49669498,2015-10-05,43947896,Darin,"Had a great stay in Seattle in Len's apartment. The location was great, the apartment was clean and Len was very responsive to my questions. Wifi connection was good. Parking was a little difficult with some construction and 2 hour limits in the area, but we didn't have any problems."
7901318,44063021,2015-08-23,32052139,Tyler,"Liza and her home are fantastic. I had multiple changes of schedule and she went above and beyond to make sure things worked smoothly.  The photos in the listing should show that the home has an amazing view but what they don't show is the fantastic natural light and perfect location in the heart of Capitol Hill. Liza's experience as an interior designer shows throughout with the perfect use of space.  If you are looking to explore something other than Starbucks or the space needle don't hesitate to ask; Liza was extremely helpful pointing me in the right direction for things a little off the beaten path.  I would definitely stay here again. 

Thanks Liza!"
7901318,44261311,2015-08-24,39956124,Marianne,"This place was great! I don't know if the pictures truly do it justice. It's very adorable - I don't think the pictures do the listing any justice. 

Liza definitely made me feel very welcome. This was my first time in Seattle and she helped me find my way from the airport to the apartment. It's a 5th floor, corner apartment with lots of light, amazing breeze, all important things to consider in Seattle. It was amazing to be able to wake up to a view of the Space Needle. 

Liza had fresh flowers, newspapers, eggs, yogurt, bread and milk ready for me when I arrived. Felt like home. 

The location is amazing because it's right in the hub of Capitol Hill. There are about a dozen great bars, a market, and great restaurants within a three minute walking distance. I would book this place again (in fact I ended up booking it again on the spot). 

Liza was also pretty flexible with my checkin time (I came into Seattle around 6pm) and my checkout. Very convenient."
7901318,44599730,2015-08-27,16793532,Benjamin,"Liza's place is unbelievable! It's tastefully decorated and has an unreal view of the city and space needle. Liza was also very accommodating, available and helpful. "
7901318,44996204,2015-08-30,41675775,Angelica,Great experience. Liza was so accommodating and sweet - not to mention the place was super cute! Very easy walk to downtown and there was a great view of the space needle from the living room window. 
7901318,54212650,2015-11-16,34930475,Spencer,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying in Liza's place! It was very cozy, great space, and location!

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a taste of Seattle! I would come back here next time we visit!"
6949900,37924588,2015-07-11,821543,Steve,"Dustin's place was perfect for our trip to Seattle.  It slept 3 comfortably and the space was super clean!  Great security in the building. He even left a bottle of wife for us, which my wife loved!  Dustin was very responsive to any questiobs wr had.  I would stay here again!"

6949900,39680058,2015-07-25,6880260,Mike,Dustin made things very easy. Good location a few minutes from Capitol Hill. Left snacks to make us feel welcome. Good communication.
6949900,39820526,2015-07-26,37743086,Nafiza & Justin,"Dustin was a great host. He replied to emails and texts quickly. The unit was in a great location and accurately described. Instructions were easy to follow and we had no trouble getting into the unit. We had some issues with parking, that was at no fault to Dustin. He worked on trying to find a solution for this problem. 

Our main concern was the cleanliness of the bathroom. It could have received a deeper cleaning prior to our arrival. However, overall it was a comfortable stay. We were able to enjoy the rooftop patio and fire pit, as well. Thank you, Dustin!"
6949900,40981198,2015-08-03,12740245,Amy,"Dustin's place was easy and comfortable to stay in. Arrival was seamless. Communication was prompt. 

He provided little extras like granola bar/snacks and beverages as well as some toiletries in the bathroom. The new portable A/C unit actually came in handy too with the record breaking heat we had! 

Although we had no idea, Seafair was going on that weekend and his building's rooftop view of the planes was spectacular."
6949900,41671355,2015-08-08,34706664,Miram,My friend and I enjoyed our short time at Dustin's place. Extremely easy check in and out. Dustin left us snacks and drinks which was a nice touch. The portable ac made it much more comfortable.  We both agreed that the rooftop view was the icing on the cake. Only negative was the place could of been a tad cleaner. I would definitely stay here again.
6949900,41802299,2015-08-09,8658752,Matthew,Dustin's space was comfortable and well represented by the photos. It was in a nice building and the rooftop terrace was an added bonus. We were walking distance from Capitol Hill restaurants and bars as well as any other activity/location in the heart of Seattle. Dustin was quick to respond to questions and the snack basket was a nice touch. I'd definitely stay here again!
6949900,44805799,2015-08-29,17841240,Tom,"Dustin provided a complimentary snack basket and a well-furnished apartment. Communication with Dustin was responsive, and I was able to navigate the key/keycard pickup successfully. Didn't use the amenities of the building, so I can't speak to those. 

Encountered a snafu with parking. I'd selected this modern studio in large part for the underground parking and gated access, (driving up from Portland for the weekend). Dustin let me know the day before I arrived that the previous tenant had broken the parking access remote, there was not a spare and I wouldn't be able to park in the underground lot. 

This meant I had to find outdoor parking in Seattle, which is never, ever fun. All streets around this location require a neighborhood permit (if space is even available), and while there is a small pay lot nearby, it's really small and has a 10 hour limit. While Jefferson St. is not well marked as requiring a permit, it does. (I have the parking ticket to prove it.) To his credit, Dustin promptly credited me some compensation in return for the parking trouble, I did end up leaving Seattle with a parking ticket—a bit of a damper on an otherwise comfortable stay."
6949900,45329529,2015-09-01,25303394,Jordan,"Great host and a great apartment for two people to stay in. His place is clean and well-organized, and he was a very welcoming host. Everything you could need is within a mile walk or so of the apartment!"

His home is cozy, well-appointed and convenient. We enjoyed our stay immensely. It it convenient to public transportation, dining and nightlife, and we had a wonderful time. "

I decided to use AIRBNB for the first time.   I had bid another location but didn't receive confirmation.  Julie responded to my last minute request.  She was very accomodating in this last minute situation, and met me late in the evening  to exchange the keys. (Thanks Julie) 

The cottage is as seen in the pictures, bright and cozy with all the accomodations to cook, relax with T.V. and internet service. Also pay washer and dryer on premises. The  bed was really comfortable and had quality linens.  Very private, and lovely gardens. (Matt even brought me cut flowers one morning, nice surprise)!

The cottage is in a great location in the Capitol Hill District. Within walking distance to shopping, resturants, Volunteer Park and a QFC grocery store. Downtown is within miles, and accessible by bus or car. Parking  is a little challenging, and don't park in front of the cottage. I got a ticket.  

Matt and Julie are great hosts.  Any concerns are addressed promptly and focused to make your stay comfortable. Thanks for turning a challenging situation in to a workable blessing.  Matt cooked dinner one evening, and it was yummy!! 

 To my fortune, I found a long term rental through them.  Really nice people to meet  along the path, do business with, and call friends.  Thanks for everything!!  "
139463,325151,2011-06-20,574736,Clare,"This is the perfect place for a visit to Seattle! Nick & I absolutely loved the studio. The place itself is gorgeous, so thoughtfully decorated and filled with everything you could need (and more). The abundant cooking equipment encouraged us to go to the (great) local store and cook. The internet connection was great. The bed was super comfortable. We were left with many more towels and other supplies than we needed. The location was perfect - easy to get to downtown (we walked) and right on Broadway which is filled with heaps of places to eat and drink. On Julie's recommendation we also made our way to 15th Ave which was only a few streets away and also has lots to do.

Julie and her husband were very easygoing and helpful, and their son was super cute! We only met them at check-in, but felt that they were only a phone call or e-mail away if we needed them.

We would most definitely recommend the studio to anyone visiting Seattle. If only we could find accommodation like this in every place we went!"
139463,362199,2011-07-09,644683,Jennifer,"Julie and Matt's place was a great place to stay during our Seattle trip. We were delighted to see how quaint the garden is, the bed is super comfy, the place is really clean and the location is superb. We are transit travelers, so the bus system was easy for us to figure out and the buses were really close by. The neighbourhood has lots of restaurants and a grocery store, so there is never a struggle to find food or if you wanted you could cook dinner for yourself, personally we only used spoons for ice cream. All in all this was our first, and certainly not our last Airbnb stay. "
139463,402432,2011-07-28,351250,Vanessa,"This place is perfect for a single person or a couple! It's a very bright, cozy ground-level studio that opens up into a courtyard with lots of plants and greenery. Julie and Matt were great hosts, and the apartment was very put-together and clean upon arrival. Receiving keys was not an issue at all; Julie met me and gave me a nice quick run-down upon arrival. The apartment is located right behind busy Broadway in Captiol Hill (a very eclectic neighborhood, very ""Pride-friendly"") so it's within walking distance of lots of fun restaurants, bars, and a QFC supermarket. The other tenants in the motel-style complex were also very friendly and welcoming, which was great! Finding parking was challenging at times, as there's limited street parking -- but I did always manage to find some, even if it was a couple of blocks away. Julie was very quick on responding and very clear and concise on all of our arrangements. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle too :)"
139463,443354,2011-08-14,706503,Thomas,"Julie's place in the coolest part of Seattle (Capitol Hills) was one of the highlights during our stay in the North West! She was super flexible to meet my brother beforehand as we arrived late and we could also leave super early in the morning without really having to hand over the place. While there, we enjoyed the little cozy place a lot! It was also super cute from Julie to leave us some basics for breakfast. We highly recommend the place to any single person or couple planning to stay in a cool part of town close to the city center with nice coffee places etc. just around the corner."
139463,465173,2011-08-22,759686,Judy,"I just loved this little place! I still say it was used years ago as a housing for the nuns for the church across the street. It was serene and very peaceful....great location...you can walk to parks,markets, gym,etc."
139463,556047,2011-09-22,613993,Christian,"Julie and Matt are fantastic hosts, easily reachable by phone and extraordinarily helpful. What really stood out for us during our stay was the attention to the little details - this attention made us feel like we were truly at home.

And this property was the perfect home base for our Seattle explorations! The studio is walking distance to bus lines that go directly to Pike's Market, Seattle Center, and the University District. There's a grocery store less than a block away, a pharmacy within 5 minutes walking, and a slew of restaurants nearby, from noodle shops to burger joints to tacquerias to, yes, a Starbucks right on the corner. You can visit bookstores, clothing shops, artists studios, and a beautiful park without even leaving the neighborhood.

The studio was terrific on the days and nights we chose to stay in, too. Everything we needed we had right there - we could cook, relax with TV and internet, or simply sit out in the courtyard under the roses. It truly was a fantastic experience. Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful!"
139463,565224,2011-09-25,528629,Stefanie,"I booked Julie's place for my parents and they loved their stay! Julie was very helpful and friendly (she even let them use her personal cell phone until they got theirs working!). My parents are new grandparents so for them having Julie's cute 2year old son around was an added treat! They really enjoyed the central location of Julie's place and still they had such a quiet and private retreat in their little house. The house has a completely equipped little kitchen with a cozy kitchen nook where my parents enjoyed their breakfast and dinners (for the first breakfast Julie even brought by Bagels & cream cheese!). I will definitely recommend Julie's place to other friends & family! Thanks, Julie for taking care of my parents :)."
139463,578621,2011-09-28,846234,Rakhee,Julie was very easy to communicate with.  The appartment was very cute and the area was really interesting.  Very handy for coffee and bars and restaurants.  Broadway was buzzing but the appartment was very peaceful - we loved it!  Thank you Julie!  We would recommend Dilettante the chocolate cafe - we are still recovering from our chocolate overdose!
139463,600108,2011-10-05,562019,Wendy,"Apartment is in a very convenient location - close to bus stops,not too far (and not too close!) to capitol hill venues/clubs, lots of things to do nearby, but quiet during sleeping hours.  Beautiful gardens outside, interior was cute and cozy.  Matt and Julie were great hosts."
139463,609130,2011-10-08,1185893,Robert,"This place is fantastic.  Great location, very friendly hosts.  Small but cozy, all you need in a place to stay for a weekend.   Matt and Julie were great.  Thanks for such a nice stay!"
139463,641251,2011-10-18,39130,Frances,"Really lovely, cosy apartment in a great location in Seattle. Buses outside, but it was also an easy walk into the downtown area, and I usually walked (even stumbling home at night a couple of times). Had a conference in Seattle so for most of the time I was there it was sleeping and eating only! But I would recommend spending more time in the surrounding area than I did, heaps of parks and stores and bars on Broadway and nearby Seattle Community College. Julie and Matt were very welcoming and went out of their way to meet me after my train came in late at night (on Matt's birthday no less - hope you had a great one!)"
139463,653048,2011-10-22,1263655,Alessandro,Couldn't ask for a better place next ro broadway. The place was very clean. Matt and julie were easy to talk too and accommodating!
139463,673298,2011-10-29,401794,Daniella,"My fiancee and I spent four nights at this amazing, amazing location. It was perfect. We met with Matt to receive the keys and to get a quick run down of the cottage. He was very professional and was able to answer all of our questions. The cottage is in a great location, you can walk everywhere. It is clean, and equipped with all the amenities that you would need. I highly recommend staying here! "
139463,697709,2011-11-07,1126242,Melissa,"This is truly a sweet studio apartment. Julie and Matt have created a very comfortable, welcoming pad. I loved staying at theire!!! They have equipped it with everything you could possibly want to cook, bathe, sleep, eat, and rest/read/work. It is in a marvelous location. I can't think of anything I would do to change it. They are attentive but unobrusive. I recommend their ""cozy"" apartment (which it really is, and quiet) to anyone and everyone. Thank you, Julie and Matt, also Aribnb."
139463,715221,2011-11-13,1126242,Melissa,"This was my second time with Julie and Matt. They are marvelous hosts. They were so helpful, kind, flexible. Their cozy apartments is ideally situated to action while being very quiet and peaceful. Their place is perfection in my eyes. Thank you so much, Julie and Matt. Airbnb too."
139463,737206,2011-11-22,1017388,Christy,"This space is cozy and a perfect setup for a great stay.  Comfortable bed and all the amenities one would need.  Location is convenient to plenty of restaurants and the best coffee ""Vivace"".  Highly recommended. "
139463,769194,2011-12-06,365916,Linda,The host canceled my reservation 29 days before arrival.
139463,17783863,2014-08-17,5242098,Reshma,"Julie and Mike were great hosts, super prepared, made us feel at home, and provided anything we could possibly need, including a full kitchen!  We loved the neighborhood and apartment (which was really nicely decorated and cozy) and it was super convenient to have a laundry that we could use in the middle of our trip.  Neighbors are quiet and respectful as well.  Highly recommend staying here!  "
139463,18019509,2014-08-20,17517164,Victoria,"Julie and Matt were great. The studio was so cute, in a fun neighborhood with bars and coffee shops around the corner. The place was clean, cozy and perfect for a short or longer stay. An easy 25 minute walk to downtown and easy to get an über or lyft if needed. We would definitely recommend this property! "
139463,18552771,2014-08-28,18808766,Christiane,Julie and Matt made us feel very welcome. They are nice and easy going and answer any questions immediately. 
139463,18809179,2014-09-01,18418873,Brian,"Julie and Matt were great hosts - very prompt and professional. The residence was in a great location, well maintained, and clean. Highly recommended - would stay again!"
139463,19078563,2014-09-06,17742383,Karla,It was a really nice and clean studio literally right where everything was! It was a perfect location for my stay in Seattle! 
139463,19370155,2014-09-11,12554727,Allison,"The hosts were easily accessible pre arrival and very accommodating with the key hand off.  Matt was there to provide an overview of the space and was super friendly, making us feel instantly welcome.  He had lots of good recommendations. They also has lots of Seattle guides and brochures available for easy reference which was helpful.  I appreciated the guest book which was there, with tips from previous air bnb'ers with lots of helpful advice on places to go and things to see.  The actual place was cozy and homey and the perfect place from which to start our Seattle adventures.  Right off of Broadway, coffee, a supermarkets and lots of cheap eats are in walking distance.  Venture a few minutes further into Captiol Hill, a quick walk, for prime bars and restaurants.  Hit up Skillet Diner and Glo's  for breakfast! Bus routes pick up a few steps outside of the unit to take you downtown and the walk downtown is doable as well.  Capitol Hill is a great area! Very close to Volunteer Park which is great for morning workouts or a stroll to take in the views from the water tower.  The neighborhood has charming Seattle style homes and we felt safe walking both in early am and at night.  "
139463,19606959,2014-09-15,9886965,Monika,"We loved our stay at the cozy urban studio! The studio was cute, clean, and quiet and had everything you would need. The location is PERFECT and we wandered from Capitol Hill to most neighborhoods on foot. If you like staying in a fun and walkable neighborhood this is a great bet. Matt and Julie were very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay again."
139463,19831226,2014-09-19,11817105,Lauren,"This was our first Airbnb experience and given its success, it won't be our last. We loved staying at the urban studio. The apartment is located within a charming row of 1920s studios with beautiful greenery in the courtyard between. Inside, it's quiet, clean, and cozy. The apartment is a great amount of space for two people. Our host Matt greeted us on arrival and even sent us a text the next day to make sure we were settling in alright. Location was perfect - we felt like locals in Capitol Hill and walked all over the neighborhood and downtown. Recommend nearby Victrola for coffee and Kedai Makan for Malaysian street food, and take a walk around Volunteer Park (the nearby Volunteer Park Cafe was also delicious). The Fremont, Ballard, University District, and Queen Anne neighborhoods were a quick bus or Uber ride away. If you want to feel like a local in Seattle and at a great price too, I suggest staying at this studio!"
139463,20055864,2014-09-22,6429680,M. Antoinette,"The Studio in Capitol Hill was a perfect place for my parents to stay. Matt and Julie were extremely helpful the weekend of their visit, making sure that my parents had all the necessary amenities at their convenience. The location of the apartment is also perfect for anyone wanting a mix of the neighborhood and bar feel within Capitol Hill. Thanks for being awesome hosts!"
139463,20288169,2014-09-27,9605081,Naomi,Julie was very responsive and helpful. I was able to stay in touch with her and Matt so that our meeting at the apartment was seamless. We felt very fortunate to stay at this charming 1920's apartment. It was just right and the location was excellent. Great for walking and taking buses. My husband and hope that we can book this place again in the future. Thank you julie and Matt.
139463,20562543,2014-10-01,608436,Ghee,"Julie was a wonderful host.  She was very flexible with my late arrival.  

The apartment and the setting are simply charming, in lush and garden like environment.  It is also very conveniently located, just one block from Broadway where there are many restaurants, a supermarket and other amenities.  The space is well-maintained, clean, and the area is safe.  However, like all major cities, you do see some homeless people in the neighborhood.  

All in all, I would recommend staying here.  "
139463,20845528,2014-10-06,120608,Frankie,"Matt and Julie were great hosts. They were very responsive and Matt gave us good recommendations for places to go.

Studio was cozy and in a perfect location. When I come back to the area will definitely look to see if their studio is available."
139463,21212240,2014-10-13,20705013,Constantino,"My friend and I stayed here for four nights and loved it. It was my first visit to Seattle and I wanted to be in a cool neighborhood. The location of this studio is great. Lots of coffee options nearby (it's Seattle), and great dining all within walking distance. We didn't have a car and were able to get around just fine walking and using public transit. We had to take a taxi one night, when we met up with friends in Ballard.

Julie and Matt were both nice. Matt even picked my friend and me up at the airport and charged us a lot less than what a taxi would have been. The apartment itself was more spacious than we expected--not saying it's big, just less small than we thought--which was a pleasant surprise."
139463,21390391,2014-10-16,21617519,Kian,We stayed in Julie and Matt's studio for three nights during our first visit to Seattle.  Everything was super clean and the location was great for walking downtown (albeit with hills on the way back!). Matt met us upon our arrival and welcomed us - overall it was a great first stay!
139463,21581782,2014-10-20,2007167,Masami & Chris,"We had a very nice stay at Cozy Urban Studio.  Matt was so helpful and stayed in touch with us throughout the stay.  We so appreciated his attentiveness and his positive nature.  It rained a lot while we were there, but he definitely brought sunshine into our stay.
Thank you!  We will be back soon :)

It had everything I needed. The hosts were flexible, friendly and very helpful.  Loved the garden entrance.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!"
139463,22031045,2014-10-28,578249,Larry And Susan,We enjoyed our stay.  The place was exactly as described and very comfortable and quiet.  The neighborhood was great for walking and very convenient with a really good grocery nearby and good restaurants. We would recommend it to our friends traveling to Seattle.
139463,22534604,2014-11-09,3104076,Kirill,Cute place in a great location.
139463,23007601,2014-11-20,21941134,Merrill,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for about a week. Matt & Julie were very easy to get in touch with and very accommodating.  The studio was clean and just enough room for the both of us. 

I absolutely LOVED the location. There were tons of restaurants and shops just a foot step out the door which was awesome! Also, as a few of the other review noted there was a grocery store less than a block away which was huge. We loaded up on bottled water, snacks, and some beer. 

Only thing I would note is the heater was a bit noisy so if you're staying during the colder months and a light sleeper that would be something to note. It took a few nights for us to get use to it. "
139463,23099928,2014-11-23,21940775,Andrew,"Julie was a great host. We found the apartment as described—cute, clean, and in a great location.

We appreciated the helpful guestbook where previous visitors had left tips about fun things to do nearby."
139463,23321341,2014-11-29,18154336,Mary,"While we didn't meet Julie she was communicated everything we needed to know and had a neighbor let us in.
The studio was adorable with small cozy ,well supplied kitchen, living room and bathroom. There was great storage and built in dresser. The court yard was well kept. Coming from Maine...I was mesmerized by the 6+ft. rosemary shrub right outside our door!
It was right in the middle of Capitol Hill and very close to amazing restaurants, nightlife and museums. We felt safe while still enjoying amenities of a city.
I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone."
139463,23529508,2014-12-03,19855988,Jill,"Great location, very walkable with lots to see and do. Cozy and comfortable. Julie was great to work with!"
139463,27472016,2015-03-05,2171784,Clare,"SO peaceful.  And exactly what I needed.  I wish I would have booked it for a longer stay.  The place itself is hella cute, and the bed  is super comfortable.   I am pretty sensitive to noise, and usually sleep with earplugs, but I didn't need them while staying at Julie's studio.

One thing -- the refrigerator is in a little alcove, through the door by the kitchen sink.  It took me a few minutes to realize that is where the refrigerator was.   

The location is great, too.  Within a few blocks, there are excellent places to eat and  grab a drink, while you wander around in Capital Hill.  One thing I wasn't expecting though, was the seriousness of the hills in Seattle.  I've lived in San Francisco, so I thought I knew all about hills.  Depending on what angle you walk back up Capital Hill from downtown, it can be a seriously long butt-burner.  But hey -- there is always the bus...

I did not have a chance to meet either Julie or Matt in the flesh, but they were very responsive and available  via text/phone.  Check in and check out went seamlessly.  

I would not hesitate to stay here again.  "
139463,27621320,2015-03-08,25502454,Dani,"This studio was absolutely perfect for our stay. Matt and Julie were very accommodating, and even arranged for my boyfriend and I to check it late at night because of our flight schedule. The apartment was clean and well-stocked with towels, kitchen ware, etc. It's in an adorable little complex right off of Broadway in Capitol Hill, which has tons of restaurants, bars, and shops. Very easy to walk downtown or take public transportation. Would definitely stay again the next time we're in Seattle."
139463,28164541,2015-03-19,26641191,Marilyn,"Matt met us in a timely manner and showed us around the apartment. He was very friendly and helpful and we had a comfortable stay. Thanks for sharing this great place.
"
139463,28403936,2015-03-23,2458140,Denise,"Very cozy little space in a very happening location.  Charming and very clean, quiet -- set back from the street.  Good gluten-free/grass-fed beef options at the near-by Deluxe Pub and easy bus rides to the U district and Henry Museum.  Parking is challenging like most urban settings, but you're given a permit that grants you more options.  Thank you Matt and Julie ;)"
139463,28570277,2015-03-26,7042948,Morgan,"Matt and Julie were amazing hosts! They were very friendly and quick to respond to my questions, and Matt even came to pick me up in the airport! The apartment is adorable, and the location is great: for this visit, I was really just looking for a quiet place to get some work done, and the apartment was close to lovely coffee shops and tasty (& affordable) restaurants, and it was easy to feel at home there. Thank you so much, Matt & Julie, for a great visit -- and I hope that I'll have another chance to come back to Seattle soon!"
139463,28929574,2015-04-01,4921729,Vivi,"Julie and Matt were fantastic. They were very responsive with any questions I asked and were very accommodating! The neighborhood is very cute, just around the corner from a really nice park you can run at and literally around the block from bagels and starbucks. Pike place market was just about a mile down the road that we walked to almost every single day. The neighborhood is also very calm, clean and beautiful. The apartment is cozy, cute, and had wifi, t.v and all the amenities you would need. The bed and pillows are so comfortable! I would definitely stay here again! Thank you Julie and Matt for everything!"
139463,29545144,2015-04-09,25659687,Katrina,"Matt and Julie were awesome and the place is perfect. Great location, cozy space and Matt and Julie were kind, friendly and always available. They even provided us transportation to and from the airport  (even at 430 am!) I would highly recommend renting from them."
139463,29820088,2015-04-13,10784754,Rhian,"The apartment was in a great location. 20-30 minute walk for most attractions with bus routes close by. The apartment was ideal for our needs and was very neat. The bed was very comfy. 
We didn't get a chance to meet the hosts but they were easy to contact and would always respond. 

I would definitely recommend this sweet apartment and we look forward to stay here again if we are in Seattle  "

139463,30462476,2015-04-22,277105,Geris,"Good neighborhood, good location.  Little bit tough to find parking if you are renting a car. Be sure to let host know ahead of time, so you can get a parking pass."
139463,31184167,2015-05-03,10928819,Laura,"Julie & Matt are such great hosts, and the apartment is the perfect base for exploring Seattle! Julie was very communicative in the weeks leading up to our visit, and Matt gave us a ride from the airport and made sure we had everything we needed. They were also very accommodating of our travel plans (late checkin and late checkout). If you don't know where to begin your adventure, ask Matt and Julie or take a look at the notebook where other guests have left tips!

The apartment is perfectly sized for a couple, in a building with an adorable courtyard, on a quiet block that is just a couple minutes of walking from a large grocery store, shopping, bars, and restaurants. It's easy to get downtown and to the waterfront by foot or by bus, but there's plenty to do in the neighborhood if you don't feel like adventuring far.

We loved this apartment and would definitely stay here again!"
139463,31702401,2015-05-09,13808814,Lujain,Julie and Matt are really hospitable and accommodating. Their studio is nice and truly cozy and the garden entrance is so pretty. It is clean and Its location is perfect.  
139463,32053481,2015-05-13,9922419,Jamie,"Great cozy place! Julie's husband, Matt, manages the apartments and gave a warm welcome and tour. It's a great location, very walkable for exploring Capitol Hill. Highly recommended."
139463,32336626,2015-05-17,93372,Bozena,"The studio was lovely! Great big closet, cozy bed, kitchen comes equipped with microwave and French Press. It was a great experience, except for...parking! Drove around for 20 minutes on a Sat night trying to park after a late dinner. Not the host's fault but something to be aware of if you plan on driving to the area"
139463,32702425,2015-05-20,6427672,Emily,"This was a great little studio in a fantastic neighborhood of Seattle. We loved the area, so walkable to everything you need. The apartment was the perfect size for two people, and didn't feel too much like a studio with a separate kitchen and dining area. "
139463,33646247,2015-05-31,1689259,Dimitrios,"We had a lovely Studio with everything we needed. Instructions were clear and we found everything as told. The area is friendly, quite and close to a big 24/7 supermarket (QFC), Starbucks, lots of small restaurants and a bus station. Thank you Julie & Matt for having us! "
139463,34059710,2015-06-04,24400135,Luiz Gustavo,"Very nice, cool, charmy, cosy and confortable studio. I really recommend it! Hope I can stay again in there."
139463,34399288,2015-06-08,24881093,Ami,"My boyfriend and I rented the studio for four nights in June.  Matt and Julie were very responsive, and Matt offered to drive us to the airport for a good price even though it was early in the morning.  They were also flexible with our check-in time which was helpful.  

The temperature was in the 80s during our stay and the studio got very warm in the evenings, even with the windows open.  We used the fan provided but unfortunately it did little to keep the bedroom cool (there's no A/C unit).  Also, the bed seemed to sink in the middle.  This probably isn't as much of a problem if there is only one person in the bed.

The studio is a short walk to the shops and restaurants in Capitol Hill.  While the main street was full of university students out late at night, the apartment is in a quiet area and seemed safe.  We agree with other reviewers that the studio was clean and spacious enough for two people."
139463,35554723,2015-06-20,31550826,Candice,"Julie and Matt made our first Airbnb rental a very positive experience. They kindly accommodated our late arrival into Seattle and made the check-in and out process extremely simple. The studio was more than enough space for our brief trip and we appreciated the small amenities provided such as the coffee and cable tv.

We really enjoyed the location with a 24 hour grocery store and plenty of coffee shops and restaurants. There were also several buses that pass through the area, making transportation without a car feasible. 

Thanks again for providing us with a great place to stay. :)

The parking pass provided was so helpful, and was able to find nearby overnight parking on 10th fairly easily. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a serene getaway in the busy Capitol Hill getaway. "
139463,36762327,2015-07-01,28813423,Anna,"It was very welcoming, Matt picked me up from the airport and showed me where all the fun things in the neighborhood were. It's a little studio, perfect for one person and walkable to a lot of cool places. "
139463,37148562,2015-07-05,25028735,Keely,"We had such a great time in Seattle, and Julie & Matt were so responsive and accommodating - even while having a baby, we later found out!!! The place was awesome and had everything we needed, and in a great location from where we were able to walk (sometimes farther than others) to all the corners of the city. The Capitol Hill neighborhood was spectacular and felt very safe - anyone visiting could easily spend their entire time there alone. In the heatwave going on while we were there we quickly learned about limited residential AC in the area, but their unit came with a great fan that quickly cooled the place off at night after a cool shower to wind down from all the hot urban sightseeing! We would definitely recommend this place and these hosts to any future Seattle travelers!!!"
139463,37554299,2015-07-08,29039168,Casey,"Julie and Matt were great hosts. They were both very responsive even though Julie gave birth to their baby the day before I arrived! Everything was very clean and as described. The only thing more that I could've wanted was an air conditioner. It was very hot during my time in Seattle and as a solo female traveler, I didn't feel comfortable leaving the windows open. The apartment is old and it isn't normally so hot in Seattle that I understand why one isn't there. Overall, I'd definitely stay at Julie and Matt's again!"
139463,38479645,2015-07-16,26516342,Vanessa,All perfect! Nice and friendly contact! Wonderful place to stay
139463,39909765,2015-07-27,17040701,Andrew,Julie and Matt are great hosts and really accommodating. The location is tremendous and the unit has everything you could need for a great stay. 
139463,40321773,2015-07-30,17543920,Alex,Lovely studio in an excellent location. A great base from which to explore Seattle. Thanks Julie and Matt.
139463,40888589,2015-08-03,29296070,Jacqueline,"This was a great space for just my husband and me and made us feel a part of the Capitol Hill scene. Julie was great about answering questions promptly and making the check-in/out process very simple. I agree with previous reviews that the mattress slumps quite a bit in the middle, to the point that repeatedly rolling into one's bed partner is unavoidable. Aside from the bed, all other aspects of the studio were great! No issues with noise, disturbance, etc. All in all, a nice place to call a temporary home while visiting Seattle."
139463,41924680,2015-08-10,8838675,Linda,Wonderful location in Capitol Hill with tons of restaurants and things to do. It was walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. Julie was very responsive the entire time and made the check-in and check-out process extremely easy. The place itself has a super comfy bed and was very clean. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. Highly recommend staying here!
139463,42379752,2015-08-13,27392512,Britt,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it exceeded our expectations more than we ever could have hoped! Both Julie and Matt were so helpful and sweet, they answered our emails quickly and communicated with us right up to the minute we walked in the door. The apartment was just perfect, big comfy bed, lovely clean bathroom and kitchen, not to mention plenty of info to help us get settled. The location was fantastic also, right around the corner from a wide variety of shops and restaurants and a nice half an hour walk to the main CBD and Waterfront. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle this is the place. Seriously, book it now! "
139463,43213432,2015-08-18,25131661,Terese,"This Airbnb was the best we have been to by far. It was cute, cozy, and very well stocked with towels and kitchen necessities. It had maps and bus routes available as well as recommendations for sightseeing. Julie was available by phone anytime we needed her. She responded immediately. It was a great neighbourhood with many restaurants and a grocery store around the corner.  Busses were available around the corner that go into downtown. We would definitely use his place again if we come to Seattle.  The only recommendation I would make is to have a bigger or brighter address number as we arrived at nighttime.  Thanks Julie ! We loved it"
139463,45238502,2015-09-01,30504302,Garry,"Julie and  Matt made us feel welcome and accomodated our particular late checkin. The neighbourhood is very safe and quiet with all facilities close by. 
The studio unit had all the facilities that anybody would want or need. A parking permit was provided if needed. The unit had a full kitchen with all utensils etc.
The only issue we had was with the saggy bed - it would be ok for one person but a bit of a problem for a couple."
139463,45492479,2015-09-03,40520910,Jacob,"Great communications, met us at the apartment to make sure we had everything we needed."
139463,45921388,2015-09-07,18365441,Robyn,"Julie was very welcoming and kept in touch throughout our stay. The apartment was very quaint, exactly like the photos. We loved the position on Capital Hill, a strenuous walk to downtown and back so we felt well exercised, but there are also very cheap busses to downtown. Wandering around Capitol Hill area was beautiful, parks close by and we loved the brass dance steps on the pavement down Broadway. A brilliant restaurant, Poppy was a 5 minute walk for dinner, but lots of others too. A great place to stay."
139463,46366609,2015-09-10,3789001,May,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful 3 night stay in Julie and Matt's studio. Julie and her husband Matt were great hosts. Although we didn't meet Julie, she was ready to pick up the phone when we needed directions to get to the studio and Matt popped by later to make sure we had settled in and even gave us a lift to the airport at the end!

We had a really relaxing stay, the studio is on a quiet street which is amazing as it's just around the corner from Broadway which is full of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a supermarket. The bus stop is only a 5 minute walk away and buses are frequent, but Seattle is so walkable, we usually strolled into the centre.

We loved all the detailing in the studio too as it looks like the original sinks and kitchen drawers have been kept. The studio was clean, comfortable and had enough room for the two of us. It was a great place to stay while we explored Seattle. We'd love to come back!"
139463,47036411,2015-09-15,4538159,Leslie,"We had a lovely time in the studio. Matt met us at the studio and made sure that we had everything.  The on-street parking is a little tight, but we were always able to find a spot within a block or two. The free parking pass was a big help. We enjoyed having the full kitchen and full fridge. The WiFi was fast. The bed was too soft for us, but we prefer a firm bed. The studio is in Capitol Hill on 10th Ave EAST. Our gps almost took us to just 10th Ave, so be careful with the directions."
139463,48395052,2015-09-26,8138689,Greg,"Had a great time staying at Julie and Matt's place. Perfect spot for a couple or single person to explore Seattle from. Clean, cute, and simple place to stay. Nice little cottage with a well equipped kitchen, which is great if you don't want to spend every meal out. Julie and Matt were very nice and accommodating.

Also, really close to a ton of great coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. Most places worth checking out in Capitol Hill were a 15 min walk or less. Would definitely stay again if in the area. Thanks!"
139463,48729263,2015-09-28,41675694,Azadeh,"Julie contacted me a few days before our trip to see if we needed to store our luggage with her or even a ride from the airport!  We did not need either as we rented a car, for which she left a parking permit so we could park in the neighborhood. The place was quaint and cozy as described, very clean and fridge stocked with some snacks and coffee.  We loved walking from the studio to the coffee shops in the area.  Thanks for a great stay!"
139463,49100522,2015-10-01,34237196,Jody,"Don't take this lightly when I say, this studio MADE OUR TRIP!
It was just adorable and in the perfect place for walking anywhere we wanted to go!! We didn't use our car at all while we were in Seattle, and walked EVERYWHERE! There is wonderful shopping & dining in this area, and downtown is 20-30 minute walk. The other wonderful thing about the studio is that it feels very private and safe, though bustling streets are just a few blocks away.  We also had parking right outside the courtyard!

The owners were very friendly and accommodating through email and phone conversations. Unfortunately we were not able to meet them face to face, but they were very easy to get a hold of, and made us feel very welcome! 

We ABSOLUTELY plan to come back and hope to stay in the Cozy Urban Studio again! "
139463,49428829,2015-10-04,1318696,Attila,"Pro:
- very responsive and helpful host
- great neighborhood
- nice, clean apartment, perfect for a couple
- provided a guest parking pass

Cons:
- bed was too soft, with an indentation in the middle"
139463,49971075,2015-10-08,31116,Paul,"On arrival the apartment was spotlessly clean. I didn't get to meet the hosts but that wasn't a problem at all, their communication was very clear and straightforward as to what I needed to do on arrival. They were at the end of an email or phone if I needed them. The apartment is perfectly formed and has everything you'll need for a stay in Seattle. It has a beautiful charm about it. I was able to get the ""49"" to Downtown for Pike Market and Pioneer Square. In fact, Seattle is very easily accessible. If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle, this apartment has my highest recommendation. Enjoy..."
139463,50444709,2015-10-12,39762315,Manuela,"Julie was really nice all the time, always available for answering my questions and really helpful.
The house is really great, clean, tidy, and had everything that we needed.
Everything was perfect!"
139463,50929549,2015-10-16,30453906,Sergio,"Julie and Matts place was better than anticipated.  Of course I already knew that the location was perfect.  Central to everything you need and want to be around.  Grocery store , restaurant, coffee shops and retail are just steps away the next street over. And yet this cozy apartment is tucked well away in a very charming gated complex. The bed was super comfy as well as the pillows. The pictures don't do this place enough justice.  The apartment is a lot more spacious than anticipated and has everything that you could possibly need. Lots of hangers.  Iron. Dresser.  I can go on and on.  Whenever I plan to return to Seattle; this is definitely going to be my first choice.  "
139463,51266046,2015-10-19,1479830,Ben,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay in this quiet studio.  The Capitol Hill location was perfect for our weekend getaway and made it easy to get to the  Paramount Theater, where we had tickets to a concert.  It was clean, comfortable and charming.  Although we didn't cook much, it would have been easy to do so, since there was a full galley kitchen.  The wifi was fast and reliable, making it easy to plan our adventures.  The bed was pretty soft; my wife liked it, but I prefer a firmer mattress. We would certainly recommend staying here."
139463,51690335,2015-10-24,3986376,Phil,"The unit was as advertised and we had contact with Julie before arrival, to advise of our projected arrival time, and details about getting into the unit from Julie.  It was clean and well located with regard to a great supermarket and cafes/restaurants.  We could walk to downtown in about 25 minutes."
139463,52492193,2015-10-30,40493281,Valerie,Place was clean and in a GREAT location! Very close to the heart of the city. LOTS of surrounding restaurants and bars and some spas. Bring your own toiletries or be prepared to buy some. There is a grocery store for all your needs a block away. Easy check in. Parking pass was nice to have. Would stay again if in Seattle!
139463,52832632,2015-11-02,40640682,Terry,"Everything was excellent. Julie and Matt we're great, the apartment was perfect. Capitol Hill is a lovely place, close enough to walk downtown. I highly recommend staying here. "
139463,53326006,2015-11-08,36535433,Hannah,"Great location! Adorable and charming. My friend and I stayed together and there was plenty of room for both of us. Walking distance to so many wonderful bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again! "
139463,53959762,2015-11-15,42535172,Sue,We didn't get to meet the hosts but were in contact as to where to find keys and what to do when we left.
139463,54444379,2015-11-20,21618571,Michael,"We enjoyed our stay here. It's in a great section of the city that is close to bars and restaurants, yet close enough to get to Downtown. The listing is exactly as described, and we were able to enjoy breakfast in the morning with the fully stocked kitchen."
139463,55096137,2015-11-28,21451134,Lydia,Great location with a beautiful garden!  Will stay here again when visiting Seattle!
139463,56777268,2015-12-18,3597007,Vicki,Supremely charming little studio in a perfect location. Matt and Julie are accommodating hosts. Recommended. 
9386509,56059731,2015-12-08,15393185,Vivian,"This place was super cute and in a perfect location! 
Everything was clean and in order upon arrival! There were even two bottles of water and a couple snack bars for us which came in handy when we got hungry! 
The bed and sheets were perfect for the cold weather and the closet space was sufficient to put our belongings for the trip!
The bathroom was a little surprising as it was extremely close to the bed and had only a curtain separating the two areas, but we made due so it was not a huge problem.
The host was great with answering and responding to all my questions! 
Overall this cute studio made our trip to Seattle a memorable one!"
9386509,56340757,2015-12-12,39357589,FrederickandAdrienne,"Great location, clean modern apartment. It was a worked well for my trip to Seattle."
9386509,56863052,2015-12-19,45394128,Jill,Nice place. Definitely small but cozy. I didn't love that the bathroom was only separated from the room with a curtain. The common areas are very nice. 
9386509,57187430,2015-12-22,42860353,Bryon,"Room was exactly as described, minus painting on the wall. But cozy and mins from Capital hill , Main Street Broadway "
7256122,40865771,2015-08-02,23109684,Tom,"Perfect location, clean house and friendly people, what more can you ask for? Highly recommend staying here when in Seattle. "
7256122,41656109,2015-08-08,38042928,Dianne,We had a fantastic stay at this great home. The private downstairs area was a nice relaxing space. Johan and Maria were both welcoming and very informative about the Seattle area. Downtown and the airport are easily accessible by bus from the Georgetown area. We definitely recommend this home for anyone staying in the Seattle area.
7256122,42204883,2015-08-11,39978266,Michael,"I was greeted immediately upon arriving at the home.  I was welcomed.  Met both Maria & Johannes upon arrival.  The entire basement was my setting.  It was quiet.  It was comfortable.  It was accessible.  Wifi, coffee, music player or television or peace and quiet.      I dined at a nearby gourmet pizzeria.  Nearby = 4 minute walk.
Breakfast the next morning was a nearby sole proprietor as well.  The access of this Georgetown location is tops. The hosts were Engaging, Personable, Patient, and Helpful.     "
7256122,42366871,2015-08-12,40863588,Bamboo,We loved to stay in Johannes and Maria's house. They are a nice couple. The place is very comfy and you can have your own privacy. The location which closes to highway is very convenient for us as car drivers. We would definitely stay there again if we visit Seattle.
7256122,42633897,2015-08-14,21022474,Guido,"what should I say? Luxury! Johannes and Maria are realy lovely hosts!
So don't change something :-)"
7256122,42928293,2015-08-16,39767307,Deepika,"We enjoyed our stay at Maria & Johannes's place. The house was very cozy n comfy. However, we couldn't meet our hosts. We were so looking forward to meet them. But we did enjoy our stay at Maria & Johannes's. "
7256122,44202114,2015-08-24,40785685,Hannah,"We loved our stay here! You pretty much have the floor all to yourself, with the exception that the bathroom has the washer and dryer in it. The dryer was just running once when we got back at night, but we actually never met Johannes or Maria in person. The space was very private. The bed was so comfy, we had a hard time getting up each morning. The living room area is great with surround sound, and Netflix and Hulu on the tv. Everything was clean and as expected from pictures and description. Great location to get to downtown in just a short drive. Would stay here again and recommend it!"
7256122,44959749,2015-08-30,16194137,Yoon,"Johannes and Maria are wonderful hosts. The room is down stairs, private and nice bed. I have never seen such good dogs! Thank you so much for the stay. I would recommend it to everyone. We had a car but there is a bus very near and so much places to eat around their house. "
7256122,45424885,2015-09-02,31954474,Jakub,Thank you for everything!
7256122,45833313,2015-09-06,5768340,Ashley And Seth,We had a great experience staying here!  The home is great and we enjoyed having the basement space to ourselves.  Johannes and Maria provide a great binder with suggestions of places to eat around the area and things to do in Seattle.  Johannes helped us out with any questions we had and was very welcoming.  It is very easy to get to downtown by bus from their home and it is only about a 15 minute ride!  We would recommend to anyone staying in the area! 
7256122,46543735,2015-09-11,5579426,Ben,Johannes and Maria were very hospitable and kind. We were so impressed with their home and how much they were willing to let us share it with them for a few days. Their location is a great jumping off point to explore Seattle proper and the surrounding area. Would recommend for sure!
7256122,46796482,2015-09-13,39300392,Shannon,"Johannes and Maria's house was so cute and welcoming. Having the entire basement to ourselves was great and we were able to stretch out after a long road trip. The TV, wifi and Keurig were a great plus, and the bed was super comfy. We'd definitely come back!"
7256122,47320369,2015-09-17,27733971,Jon,Thank you Maria and Johannes for letting me stay in your cozy place.  You guys are great.  You will definitely be first on my list when I return to Seattle.  
7256122,47426894,2015-09-18,27733971,Jon,I had to add one day which made a turn around more difficult for the owners but was still made to feel welcome.  The place was perfect. 
7256122,47839880,2015-09-21,652585,Joel,Johannes and Maria communicated well and made it easy to check in.  The space was comfortable and perfect for our needs (a one night stay after a wedding and before an early morning flight out of Seatac).  
7256122,48250258,2015-09-24,18996488,Sarah,Johannas and Maria have a nicely remodeled bungalow. We had a vey pleasant stay with good food within walking distance.  We highly recommend them!
7256122,49016056,2015-09-30,24032966,Katie,"Such a nice home! Super clean and we felt very welcome. 
Maria was so nice-- recommended restaurants, things to see, etc. They also have a binder with a lot of information and pamphlets in it.
It was an awesome experience! Thanks so much!"
7256122,49140063,2015-10-01,35929369,Lu,"it is the best house i've ever met. the house is colourful both inside and outside. you will understand this when you meet johannes and maria this young modern fashion couple. we stayed in basement floor, but you have totally private modern basement, including audio visual room ,private bath room and cute bed room. jahannes and maria totally leave us enjoying our own space. i definitely will come back if i go to seattle again. otherwise, i really love the locaton that easily spot airplane landing"
7256122,49500974,2015-10-04,2127977,Doris,Great place to stay!  Convenient location to Elysian brewery where we went to the pumpkin beer festival.  Wish we could have stayed longer! 
7256122,50260913,2015-10-10,6204453,Haijing,"we stay here one night ,Johannes and Maria is very friendly and helpful to us. we didn't meet them when we arrived here,because they were at a wedding....The house not far from airport ,we will leave very early next morning ,so is easy for us.
They are Outdoor enthusiasts, the downstairs is large space where we stay.
Thank you very much give us such a comfortable room


"
7256122,51052121,2015-10-17,41747632,Rachel,"This beautifully remodeled house was a great location for my boyfriend and I to explore the city and still have some peace and quiet. The bed was very nice and comfortable. Having the  bedroom, bathroom, and small living room made it feel more like a temporary home than just a room. Johanne and Maria were great to chat with and get ideas for food and exploring. My only tip to future travelers who stay here is be sure to bring socks or slippers because it is a finished basement but there is only full carpeting in the bedroom and the floors can get pretty cold at night. "
7256122,51853608,2015-10-24,25540716,John,Great little room with a comfortable bed. The hosts were quick to respond to any questions and made my stay easy to coordinate.
7256122,52254397,2015-10-27,4546371,Gus,"Maria and Johannes place in Georgetown was PERFECT for our long weekend.  We were in town for a wedding and the attached apartment was clean, quiet and just as advertised.  We were too busy to see them much, but they were great hosts and left us everything we needed for our stay.  I can't wait to come back in a few months when their new listing is completed!  The ADU looks like a fantastic space!"
7256122,52811971,2015-11-01,35672493,Megan,"Johannes and Maria were fabulous hosts! They welcomed us in after a last minute booking and were very friendly and accommodating. The space was clean and cozy and had everything we needed and more, including Fleetwood Mac records!  "
7256122,53373561,2015-11-08,46323213,Tara-Mae,"I was so fortunate to stay at this super quaint cottage nestled in quiet Georgetown. The host were not there when I arrived in the early afternoon but Johannes appeared when I was busy adoring the space and wonderful record collection. I was mostly in and out the few short days I was in town but I'm so glad I was able to meet both hosts before time was up! Super clean, inviting,great ambiance, wonderful host who make sure you're satisfied even on their own time; you have complete private time for yourself. Nothing is better than starting off your day drinking a nice cup of hot coffee and watching Point Break (one of my favorite movies) I am definitely coming to visit again. A million times referring this cute spot! Thank you Joannes and Maria! "
7256122,54019325,2015-11-15,20536266,Veta,The space was large and comfortably appointed:  it included a rec room area with a large screened TV and other amenities such as Wi-Fi.  I hate cheap hotels and this was the opposite of the experience I would expect at Motel 6.  It was homey and it met all of our needs for an excellent price.  
7256122,55235505,2015-11-29,2737264,Nils,"Johannes and Maria were really awesome hosts! Very friendly and accomodating with any of our needs, although not at all intrusive and we almost felt like we had our own apartment for our stay. We were showed the house and our room as soon as they got home. They were really just the nicest people when welcoming us to their home. They had made it very easy with instructions for the (huge) TV and the fireplace and so on. there was even a handmade guidebook to the neighborhood filled with restaurants and shops and other useful stuff.
   
the living space was as described. You get the downstairs as pretty much for yourself with toilet, livingroom and bedroom. The bed was the most comfortable ever and Franzie was really friendly and cute!

would absolutely recommend Johannes and Maria for your stay in Seattle. 10/10

"
7256122,56724456,2015-12-17,2548572,Philemon,"Johannes and Maria could not have been more gracious or accommodating.  Their basement bedroom was clean, neat, well appointed and made it as much like ""home"" as they could for our two week stay.  Added to the experience were daily welcomed visits by their very friendly and sweet dog, Franzi, who sat by the fireplace.  "
7229015,38077656,2015-07-12,37840333,André,"Minh-Chau was an excellent host! It was my first time booking a room in Airbnb and her first time hosting, so we sort of figured out the process together. She was very friendly and had such prompt responses! The room was amazing, very clean and very new. The towels and bed sheets were unbelievably comfortable -- I had to ask her where she got them so I can try to buy my own! The private entrance and private bathroom are definitely a plus, although her family is so nice that if that was not the case I wouldn't mind going through the living room and saying hi when I had to. Would definitely recommend her to other airbnb-ers and will definitely stay there again when I'm back in Seattle!"
7229015,38348824,2015-07-14,37955223,Thomas,"The bed was super comfortable and the sheets and towels were so nice. The room has a separate entrance from the rest of the house, so it's great if you like to have privacy. It's also relatively close to downtown.  I never had a chance to interact with Minh-Chau in person, but she was very friendly and prompt in communicating through email. Definitely a great place to stay! "
7229015,38776708,2015-07-18,29917265,Sara,"Great room: clean, cosy, chique, relax, etc
Good location: good connection with bus to downtown (only make sure you have change), Nice to run or walk to The lakeside 
Great host: very Nice host, minh takes very Well care of you + she gives great advice in where to eat if you like asian food, talk to her! "
7229015,39327495,2015-07-22,37898417,Adam,Booked the room for my mom while she was in town for a few days but was in touch with the owners the whole time off and on. I know that they were very accommodating and made sure to stay I. Touch with my mom as much as possible. They even got her a bottle of wine when the city had to shut off the water for a few hours in the evening and gave her a bag of fresh picked kale and save from their garden! My mom was completely blown away at the kindness and the quality of the entire interaction. The space was very safe and private and I would recommend this is anyone looking for an awesome deal.
7229015,39997740,2015-07-27,1993171,Marianna&Cesare,"That high standard room is located at the ground floor of a nice wooden house  in a very quiet residential area. The bedroom equipment (bed, linen, towels...) are simply great. All the Seattle main attractions are easy to reach by bus, but, at night, taxi or uber is suggested. It will cost about 10/13 dollars from downtown. Minh Chau is very friendly and made us feel at home."
7229015,40965964,2015-08-03,31429950,Lena,"Minh was very kind and diligent when it came to communication. She made an effort to introduce herself. She made sure we are comfortable and even thought about our well-being in the hot weather.

The suite was truly amazing. We couldn't ask for more. There was a comfy bed, comfy pillows, quality towels and even complimentary beverage in the fridge. Never had we ever had someone who thought about the little things and then some.

All and all, great value, great experience and a great location."
7229015,41802881,2015-08-09,37951518,Jesus,Minh-Chau was an awesome host! The room was very clean and exactly as described with everything we needed for our stay.  Easy access to bus stops. We even got suggestions to good places to eat around the area. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for my Seattle trip. 
7229015,42298753,2015-08-12,37836286,Darsey,"Minh-Chau provided us a great first experience using airbnb. Highly recommend this place to stay. Loved the towels and bed sheets, it made the stay that much better. It honestly felt like we where staying in a hotel without the hotel price. Couldn't agree more with the other reviews.  "
7229015,42728747,2015-08-15,38785912,Daniela,"I had a great experience here! The room is extremely comfortable, with everything that is needed, and located close to the downtown area. There was always street parking just a block away. Thank you for all the information on exploring the city, your help, and kindness. :)"
7229015,43389664,2015-08-19,26619120,Veronica,"Minh-Chau was a great hostess and the room was really a great find. The location is good if you want to remain close to the city while being removed from the bustle. The room served its purpose well; the bed was comfortable with great sheets, the environment was quiet, and the neighborhood was safe. The attention to detail and hospitality really made the difference. Would definitely recommend. "
7229015,43684021,2015-08-21,39062749,James,"Minh-Chau was a fantastic host. The room was clean and well laid out when I arrived and she came over on the first day to introduce herself.

The room is separated from the rest of the house by an entire floor so I heard nothing going to sleep and Minh-Chau said that she can't hear anything from the guests room either.

The area is quite nice but I found myself getting a Lyft/Uber into the city to see anything because it was a bit too far to walk.

One small thing to note is that I found the shower took a minute or so to heat up, but this wasn't an issue for me at all."
7229015,44790226,2015-08-29,8388245,Nikki,"Minh-Chau was a wonderful host. We arrived early and had no problem with checking in early. The room is exactly like the pictures and has a keypad entry so no key to worry about on your trip. The area is within the city but outside of the main noise. We used public transit to get around which was very easy. The bus took us about 20 min to centre of city and we walked one day which took about 40 min to city centre. The bus is $2.50 with a 3 hour transfer which can be used as a return if you're running in and out of city Can also get an all day pass for $8. It was a great value if you like to do alot in a day. Taxi from accommodation to city centre is about $15 and Uber is about $10. 
There is a lovely patio to enjoy. We enjoyed dinner on the patio a couple nights and snacks from pikes market after a busy day! One thing to mention however is that it is a family home with young child and it is a home your staying in so you can hear the family above which is expected but to be aware of the early mornings which didn't effect us to much. I would recommend this stay to friends, and overall we had a lovely time. Minh-Chau even gave us freshly baked cookies for our journey to the ship from her house! Thanks again! :)  "
7229015,45099005,2015-08-31,37706040,Lauren,"Minh-Chau was a great host! She is incredibly hospitable and friendly, and even baked us cookies! Her space was exactly the kind of home base we wanted while in Seattle.  The place was incredibly clean and well maintained with hotel-quality linens and towels.  We would definitely stay again!"
7229015,45486617,2015-09-03,39630984,Rob,"Nice and quiet neighborhood with a clean, comfortable room. Big plus for us is the private entrance. "
7229015,46603643,2015-09-12,20769025,Jean-Philippe,"Minh-Chau was very helpful during our stay. Minh-Chau really take care of her Guest and place. The place is really clean, bed comfortable. Minh-Chau anwser really quick when you have question. Arrival was smooth. For reference: It cost around 10$ with uberx to go downtown and 30$ to go Airport. I used the bus once and it convenient and simple but little slow compare to Uberx :). I hope we can keep in touch :)"
7229015,47056805,2015-09-15,29092819,Nick,"We both enjoyed our stay here - the room was clean, neat and very comfy. The private entrance is unique and a huge plus! Parking is ample on the street despite the construction, was never a problem. Minh Chau was an excellent host, providing nice extras in the room and even greeting us with some fresh picked Washington apples! Overall, would highly recommend. "
7229015,47478242,2015-09-19,38976459,Adam,"Our trip couldn't have gone better. Minh-Chau is so friendly and welcoming, and she will definitely make you feel at home. She even brought us a few treats during our stay. The room is super clean, the bed is comfy, and the sheets and towels are the same quality you'd find in a nice hotel. The location is pretty close to downtown, and a 15 minute bus ride will cost you $2.50 and take you right to downtown. She also has orca cards for guests, so you can put a day pass on them or add money to use them like cash. The cards will even work on the Washington State Ferry. There is ample parking within a block of the house, even with all the construction on her street. We would absolutely stay again if back in Seattle."
7229015,47733170,2015-09-21,15365284,Philipp,"Great place to stay - close Bus stations, tidy and modern! We also got freshly baked cookies! So we can recommend to stay at Mingh's place! "
7229015,48291855,2015-09-25,29505417,Caitlin,"Minh-Chau was a great host! The posting seriously underestimates the fantastic view from the front door. My friend and I were staying in Seattle for a couple days and this room was perfect for what we needed. Close to restaurants, drinks, and great coffee. The bus line is easy to get to and a Lyft ride was cheap to get downtown. Minh-Chau was very friendly and very easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again!

P.S. Only drawback: The bed was so comfortable that it made it difficult to get up in the morning :)"
7229015,49020598,2015-09-30,21100638,Wesley,Minh-Chau was very welcoming and knowledgeable about Seattle and her neighborhood and went out of her way to offer local cuisine and information.
7229015,49330536,2015-10-03,26705238,Aaron & Christine,"We flew into Seattle quite early to get our tourist on as fast as we could unfortunately, our check-in time did not correspond to our itinerary but Minh-Chau was extremely flexible and let us store our luggage in a locked unit in front of the rental on their property. While we were out at dinner Minh-Chau texted and asked if we found the place OK and how things were going. We let her know that we found the place no problems and that due to her great directions we were able to get there no problem, store our stuff and move on with our day.

When we arrived to our room later on that afternoon the place was spotless and she had left the window slightly open to let in all that good Pacific Northwest fresh air in. There were chocolates and a nice welcome note left on the bed for us. As promised there were two water bottles chilled for our consumption and fluffy fresh towels available. The room was really plenty comfortable and cozy for two people. Great bed to sleep in, warm shower available, clean space and a nice sized TV for consumption if you want. What more could one ask for?

 The place was located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood and very close to public transportation. There was construction happening in the neighborhood (the whole city is a construction maze FYI) but it surprisingly not disruptive to our stay.  Initially, we were a bit confused about the bus routes so we used Uber (which is surprisingly super affordable there). After a little assimilation we were able to navigate quite easily. We even took public transportation all the way out to Discovery Park for a nice hike!

The best part was Minh-Chau knew we were celebrating a birthday and had a long car journey the next day. After a little meet and greet one afternoon with herself, her lovely husband and adorable son she came back down with fresh baked scones!! What the what?! They were AMAZING and it was just SO thoughtful! She made enough for dessert that night AND breakfast the next morning. 

She and her family are so so gracious and a little part of me wishes we could've connected face to face earlier in our trip so we could have taken advantage of her vast knowledge and recommendations of the area. 

Thanks Minh-Chau and family for welcoming us into your home it was definitely such a comforting place to be away from home. We certainly hope to stay there again next time we're visiting Seattle!"
7229015,50450814,2015-10-12,39712091,Brian,"Our trip to Seattle was amazing! Minh-Chau was a fabulous host, provided us with all the information and tips we needed, as well as had some fresh apples and home made scones for us . Her room was very clean and cozy with everything we needed. Private entrance was a plus and had a great view. Transportation was quite easy with uber plus Minh had provided us with bus passes. If we every travel back we would definitely use her place again and highly recommend for others."
7229015,51457806,2015-10-20,41295648,Yvonne,"Minh-Chau and her sweet son Harvey greeted us upon arrival. And she even brought us fresh crisp organic apples! She made sure we had the necessary amenities from transportation tips to great foodie suggestions. Also, there's a coffee shop walking distance from the place. To top off our trip, she offered us free tickets to the Argosy Cruise since she didn't have time to use it. Overall, we had a great experience in Seattle and we would love to come back soon. P.S. Her duvet cover was the softest one I have ever felt!  "
7229015,51773759,2015-10-24,35906541,Romantiezer,"Staying with Minh-Chau was absolutely AWESOME! It was my first time in Seattle and using Airbnb too, Minh-Chau took care of every single thing I could've asked for, including instructions, directions and suggestions of places before I get to Seattle.

Her room is better than it's described in the pictures. When you arrive it's cozy and welcoming, two cold water bottles for you in the fridge. The pillows, sheets and towels are super quality and the bed is the most comfortable bed ever! seriously. Minh-Chau's house is conveniently close to several walking distance bus stops to Downtown and the neighborhood it's quiet and has some great views to downtown, one of them located at this room patio.

Minh-Chau's welcomed me with fruits and chocolate, and before I left she made cookies. She really is a 'superhost' and I'm more than thankful for all her detailed attention, I felt at home."
7229015,52254437,2015-10-27,1767143,Robin,"Minh went above our expectations to help us find a restaurant to visit and celebrate a birthday trip to Seattle! This may be the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed at. It's a small space, but there are great sheets, a quality mattress, and super-soft towels. The neighborhood is safe for a single female traveler, though most food options you want will be a bus ride away. Overall, this is a good value and an absolutely lovely host."
7229015,55100035,2015-11-28,1931308,Anita,"Minh-Chau is the perfect host.  My husband & I were visiting family in Seattle and needed a place to stay in her neighborhood. I felt confident we had made the right decision before arriving because of the information Minh-Chau provided us. When we arrived, her home was as pictured in the listing-- very inviting, super clean and comfortable.  A welcome letter and chocolates greeted us. We would definitely stay with Minh-Chau again when coming to Seattle."
7229015,56238570,2015-12-11,3853337,Bernie,"We had a great time at Minh-Chau's place. It is a super clean and well thought-out place and has everything one needs to feel comfortable in a foreign city! Minh-Chau was really friendly and we immediately felt at home when we met her. There is so much I can say about how awesome this place is, from her home-baked cookies to the bottles of water she provided in the room, but I guess I would sum it up with this being the best place we've ever stayed in on Airbnb! Thank you, Minh-Chau! We definitely hope to come back again someday :)"
7229015,56488482,2015-12-14,46081590,Monique,"Minh-Chau was wonderful and made us feel welcomed when we arrived. She even made us banana cookies! The room was very clean and since this was my first Air bnb experience , it has set the bar very high for other experiences. "
7229015,56741007,2015-12-17,40619813,Ted,"As you can probably tell from the awesome reviews, Minh-Chau was an amazing host!  She gave us super detailed directions the day before we arrived in Seattle.  We were going to take an Uber from the airport but took the link as she suggested, which turned out to be very convenient.  The room is exactly as pictured and has a private entrance, which I really appreciated.  She has all the necessary amenities (like a hair dryer), provided us bottled water, and even made us some homemade (delicious) cookies!  She greeted us when we arrived with her husband and adorable son and made us feel at home.  Great host!  Definitely recommend.  "
3208330,14174502,2014-06-13,10442212,Charlie,"Staying with Tiberio was awesome.

Where do I start?
- maybe it was the yummy breakfast that he cooked each morning
- the great conversations on a variety of topics
- the super comfortable bed
- the beautiful kitchen (check out the vegetable garden or the chicken coop!)

My stay with Tiberio was a 5/5, I highly recommend it.  His cooking was delicious (I had the pleasure of trying out his nettle pasta - yum!), his company was fun and communicating with him was easy.

"
3208330,14837382,2014-06-27,16807972,Theresa,"Staying with Tiberio was a pleasure. He was a very warm and welcoming host, the room was comfortable, and the neighborhood safe and walkable. Access to bus within a short walk but also free street parking if you have a rental car. If you like to cook, do take advantage of the beautiful well stocked kitchen, gardens full of green goodness, and fresh eggs. If you don't like to cook, no worries, just sit in the kitchen and hope that he will be cooking for an event as you get to be an official taste tester until you literally cannot put another piece of food in your mouth. Anything we needed, whether advice on great places to visit, a forgotten hairdryer, or an extra pillow, Tiberio accommodated. We came to Seattle to visit our daughter and in the course feel we found a true friend, twice the reason to come back. Lots of love to you, Tiberio, think you found your calling, xoxo - Theresa + Joe."
3208330,15011618,2014-06-30,17154108,Troy,"Our experience with Tiberio and his house in Ballard was just great. My wife and I stayed there for a couple of nights so we could tour around the breweries and enjoy the weekend. 

The house is really impressive. It is very clean and decorated with interesting pieces. The host is a chef and an artist and both of these professions are displayed prominently. The bedroom and bathroom that we used were upstairs and the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and the shower worked fine. 

The house is very conveniently located with easy access to Fremont, Ballard and downtown Seattle. We didn't take our car from the street parking hardly at all since it was easy to walk or take the bus to most of our destinations. 

We hardly saw our host during the stay. As a matter of fact, the only time we saw him was as we were leaving in the morning on our last day to drive back home. We didn't really spend much time at the house outside of sleeping. That being said, he was very accommodating  and was sure to help us with whatever we needed. There were eggs from his chicken coop for breakfast and coffee and bread was available as well. Tiberio is very friendly and I am sure he would have been fun to hang out with if we were at the house more, but we were more interested in going out on the town together, enjoying our weekend away from home. 

This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am very satisfied. I would highly recommend staying with Tiberio. I felt at home in his house and was very comfortable.
"
3208330,15346651,2014-07-07,16727236,Jeff,"Awesome host, passionate about food and life. We are lucky to get a chance to taste his cooking. It's simple and beautiful. Quiet, yet convenient location with downtown just 15mins away. I would love to visit Seattle and stay at here again."
3208330,16561907,2014-07-29,16599086,Sydney,"Great knives... ;)

Tiberio is the consummate host. He really could run his own B&B and tries tenaciously to give that experience to his guests. The room was just great, very cozy and comfortable. The bed was high quality and really comfortable, there's also a dresser and closet, which was convenient. 

The ensuite bathroom was very clean and perfectly adequate. Tiberio provided big soft towels (but no face cloths; he's European, so bring your own if you use them) body wash, shampoo and blow dryer. And he had this liquid hand soap which just smelled heavenly and made me smile every time I used it. I should've gotten the name... 

There is a great washer/dryer and good Tide soap and Downey fabric softener was provided, which I really appreciated. Tiberio does not skimp on anything. He's quality all the way, and that is massively evident when you see his nearly commercial-grade kitchen which is just fabulous, and where I spent most of my time, especially to do my work. This is the dream kitchen I could only hope to have and I took home a lot of ideas -- especially to get better knives...lol.

Tiberio is super active and camps and hikes a lot, as I gather most Seattlites and Washingtonians do, so I didn't see him too much, but had interesting conversations with him when I did. He always asked me if I needed anything. He's good about responding to texts and very attentive. I asked him if he had a clothesline. I didn't really need it, but within 2 hours, he had put up a clothesline for me in the back yard. I needed index cards and came home and found a pile on the table. Tiberio is very relaxed and laid back and pretty much lets you run with things.

This was my first experience using Airbnb and it couldn't have been better. I generally don't feel comfortable staying at other people's homes, yet I felt completely comfortable here and Tiberio was an`instant friend. Every night I left school tired and weary, I truly felt like I was going ""home"" and not just to some strange temporary place. My schedule was rigorous so I really appreciated that aspect of the experience. 

   "
3208330,16847189,2014-08-03,13932812,Marjan,"We had a wonderful stay at Tiberio's place. So far the best in our trip! The atmosphere in the photo's is really there. It is beautifull! Decoration and colours chosen with much uttermost care. Not only the room but also the patio is an enjoyable place to stay. Tiberio is a very kind and helpful host and made us feel very welcome. A pitty we didn't cook with him, but he wrote a beautiful book, so we could see what we missed, LOL.
The location is not very near to the center, but with the nearby busstop (3 min. walk) you can directly get to the center of Seattle for just 1$. We could also use the bicycles to visit the nearby premisses."
3208330,17063884,2014-08-06,18190648,Susan,"My three friends and I traveled to Seattle to take in the sights and enjoy the North Pacific Coast.  We arrived hours before our check-in time but this didn't throw Tiberio off at all.  He gave us a quick tour of the place and then recommended two great breakfast places nearby: the Dish Cafe and Senor Moose.  This is when it pays to be hosted by an airbnb chef!  There is one queen sized bed in the private room and the other half of our quartet stayed in the basement where there is a full sized bed and futon available.  The house has lots of plants (both the front yard and integrated into the living space directly) and the fresh eggs directly from the hens was a novelty. We would usually go out early and return late so we didn't get to see much of Tiberio but he made us these amazing chocolate-covered cherries and a saffron cheese custard, both lovely gestures and delicious to boot. Street parking on the block was never a problem and the location near Ballard and Fremont was a bonus after our initial desire to stay near downtown Seattle for the tourist loop.  All in all a great experience."
3208330,17235721,2014-08-09,1103558,Bethany,"I loved my time with Tiberio in his lovely home.  

The Place:  The kitchen is FANTASTIC!  It's a huge culinary kitchen with all the bells and whistles.  He did not have a class while I was there, but he cooked in it and just watching him was pretty cool.   It truly made my stay an exciting/unique experience.  My room was on the 2nd floor.  I had a full bathroom all to myself.  It was all very clean and he left instructions for everything just in case.  The wifi was super fast and it is decorated nicely.  There is plenty of parking in the street and easy to get to. He has put a lot of thought into making things comfortable for his guests. 

The Host:  I love Tiberio.  He is one of those people that instantly you want to be friends with.  I was traveling alone and needed some suggestions on the area.  Tiberio not only suggested a few things but he also took me out with him one of the nights.  We road his scooter to downtown and looked at art, went to the park and ate at a local Turkish restaurant.  (The best I've ever eaten).  He knows just about everyone in the city so we were never without company.  He made my vacation, really.  He set me up on where to go next on my road trip and called a few host friends.  I'm so glad I stayed here!  Not only did I have a blast, but now I have a friend in Seattle.  :-)

Communication and Check-in:  Tiberio confirmed my booking within an hour.  Leading up to my trip Tiberio sent me a few text messages to prepare me for the trip, suggestions, check-in info, etc.  I got in after 10pm at night.  Tiberio gave me a lock box code to get in and left the light on.  His house was easy to find even in the dark.  "
3208330,17693179,2014-08-16,16377397,Berit,"Tiberio is an amazing, interesting and wonderful host. On our first morning, we woke up to the smell of coffee and fresh bread, and once up and about we had the most intriguing first conversation which made us feel completely at home with Tiberio. He expressed warmth and generosity to our kids as well. The rooms were spotless and the atmosphere relaxing and fun. Our last night was capped off with a cooking class in Italian food with friends and Tiberio made sure that the atmosphere was relaxed and the food scumptious. Thank you Tiberio. We will be back. Love Berit, Aksel, Elizabeth & Ritchie"
3208330,17884202,2014-08-18,7273815,Bill,"Seattle is a great place to visit, and this trip my friend François and I were treated to a home away from home with Tiberio. Tiberio's hospitality was genuine and relaxed. It included some food, a glass of wine, and an impromptu cooking lesson. 

The house and its bedrooms and bathrooms is very clean. You share the space with Tiberio but it is big and bright. 

The neighbourhood is safe and leafy. A short 1/2 block walk to the bus stop gets you on a quick 20-25 bus ride to downtown. Downtown late? A $25 taxi ride (tip included) brings you home if you're out past midnight. 

We didn't take him up on it, but there are bikes to ride and parks nearby. The Fremont neighbourhood is fairly close.

Tiberio is a chef, he is social and there is always something happening in the house, whether is preparing for a big catering gig or a fellow chef dropping by for a chat.

Thank you Tiberio for a great time, we will be back! 

Bill & François"
3208330,18120140,2014-08-22,17742838,Karen,"The listing was accurate, we loved the neighbourhood. We are very self sufficient and loved the kitchen and fresh eggs but I think many people booking a b and b would think the host would be there to do breakfast. It was well described and I think accurate."
3208330,18283228,2014-08-24,20045562,Diana,"This was our 1st experience staying in an airbnb home and it was a wonderful one. We were not fortunate enough to meet our host. However he sent very welcoming emails and was very accommodating regarding helping us out with a second sleeping space. He offered fresh eggs from his hens which we did not stay long enough to take advantage of.  Room was very private, clean and I loved the windows. Having an attached bath was a bonus.  I would definitely stay here again."
3208330,18417026,2014-08-26,26795,Rebecca,"What a beautiful, welcoming home! My partner and I so enjoyed our stay in Seattle, in part because of this lovely house. Tiberio is a chef and an artist. Cannot rave enough on how much I adored his home. "
3208330,18736495,2014-08-31,9730520,Alejandra,"Staying at Tiberio's was absolutely wonderful. The place is impeccable, super welcoming, spacious, and private. He is definitely my go-to person in Seattle no questions asked. "
3208330,18991891,2014-09-04,19004969,Jennyfer,"We had a great time at Tiberio's house. We didn't spend too much time at the house, but the area was perfect, it was close enough to downtown but far enough away from the traffic and bustle of the downtown area. There are a lot of nice restaurants and parks near the house. Parking was easy to find on Tiberio's street. The room was exactly as described and felt private as it was on the top floor. Tiberio wasn't home the whole time we were there, but he made everything very easy to find and arranged others to be available in case we had any problems. Overall it was a great place to stay and was exactly as described. (I was happy to see there was a hair dryer in our room, which was convenient because I had forgotten mine!)"
3208330,19292415,2014-09-09,2283727,Christina,"Tiberio is the warmest, kindest host we have ever met! The room was exactly as pictured and his home is very beautiful. Lovely neighborhood within walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants. Tiberio made us feel at home right away; He even cooked us breakfast with fresh veggies from his garden, and fresh eggs from his hens - quite a treat!! If you're looking for an engaging and warm B & B experience, this is definitely the place. "
3208330,19684575,2014-09-16,4541601,Joseph,"We stayed at Tiberio's house in Ballard for 5 days this past week.  Our stay was outstanding.  From the moment we arrived, we had seamless service and communication with Tiberio; the room was clean and comfortable and we had an abundant selection of breakfast items including free-range eggs from his chicken coop.  The highlight of the trip was hanging out with Tiberio himself.  He's a generous and gracious host.  Each day we had a lovely engagement with Tiberio including great conversations, taking us for a beautiful morning hike at Discovery Park, a 5-star breakfast, and a Italian cooking and conversation class one evening.   He even drove us to the Clipper Ferry terminal on our way home.  We will definitely be back next time we're in Seattle. "
3208330,19952671,2014-09-21,2849656,Teresa,"Tiberio's home is just as cool as it looks on the listing. Tiberio was warm and welcoming, and we felt very comfortable there. And you can't beat the fresh eggs! They don't come any fresher. The Greenwood neighborhood was great, shops and restaurants nearby, and easy access to the rest of Seattle. Was able to avoid I-5 for most of our stay."
3208330,20111639,2014-09-23,2608663,Juliette,"Tiberio's house was as great as him! It felt like home the moment we arrived. The room is nice and clean with a private bathroom and you can use the awesome kitchen. If you are lucky you will be able to taste Tiberio's cooking, he's a great chef. He also gave us lots of useful tips on the city. Great Airbnb experience!"
3208330,20258708,2014-09-26,19726744,Catherine,Tiberio was warm friendly and the perfect host.
3208330,20342885,2014-09-28,2849301,Eric,Tiberio was just great. Very cool space. We got in a bit late and my wife was tired so she went to bed. I was hungry and tiberio was kind enough to whip up a little pasta for me. It was delicious. Very nice guy! Made a great breakfast the morning we left and we were not expecting that. I would recommend his home for sure.
3208330,20580090,2014-10-01,262355,Lynn,"My older parents and my mobility impaired husband and I had a WONDERFUL stay with Tiberio! His house is a rebuilt masterpiece, creative and inviting. Tiberio himself is SO wonderful, warm and friendly and WHAT A COOK! If you can have him cook for you then do so- watching him cook is like watching a dancer and the food is amazing. He went outside to pick the veggies right before he cooked them and he let me pick the eggs from the chicken coop my self. Fresh is best! I wish we had been there for a cooking class, my father would have loved that. If I was a teacher of ANYTHING food related I would love to host a class there, the space is custom built for food and large groups. Tiberio is a wonderful artist with a great book out on food and life which my retired minister father and my mom loved to look through, and our copy sits beside me now. His artistry shows through the whole home and he does most of the work him self, a true craftsman/artist. My husband and I stayed up late chatting with Tiberio after my parents went to have a wonderful quiet nights sleep in their big upstairs bed with private bathroom. Tiberio waived the 'shoes off' policy for my older parents, which was nice. My parents had never even conceived of something like Air BnB and they were very impressed with how fun it was. We discovered Tiberio even fished with a friend of ours, small world! Prepare yourselves for a fun night of stories and celebration if you want, or like my parents did you could just crash early ahead of a big day of travel. Stay as long as you can and enjoy this wonderful man and his lovely house. "
3208330,20829749,2014-10-06,20440927,Tracey,"Tiberio is a gracious and catering host that will make you feel right at home in his beautiful idyllic home nestled in one of Seattle's nicest neighborhoods.  A culinary wizard, he has created an amazing kitchen/living space where nothing is wasted and everything is in reach.  One of the highlights of our trip was sharing an evening of culinary exploration with our host, who is not only a great cook but a generous and warm human being.  He tempers his outgoing personality with a courteous respect for your privacy, making sure you feel comfortable and relaxed.
The room was clean and the bed cozy, a very nice base from which to explore the surrounding area which is chock full of excellent eateries and cafes.  We will definitely stay here next time we visit Seattle."
3208330,20972501,2014-10-08,4701198,Jean,"Tiberio was a very walm, welcoming host! We were able to have a flexible check-in time, borrow his bikes (with helmets and locks) to cruise around the city, and slept very comfortably in the private upstairs room. The kitchen is just as amazing as it looks in the pictures and the water pressure in the shower was awesome! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!"
3208330,21310326,2014-10-14,16638947,Cecille,"I needed a place to stay that was relatively close to my friend's place (couldn't stay with her since she has cats). Tiberio's place was perfect! The room and bathroom were VERY clean. Neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe walking around.  Plenty of restaurants, shops, bookstores and, of course, coffee shops in the Greenwood and Ballard neighborhoods. 

Tiberio was very welcoming and just has a great energy about him. I wish I had time to utilize the kitchen and take advantage of the fresh eggs but I had a pretty busy schedule. I will definitely stay at his place again next time I'm up in Seattle."
3208330,21541312,2014-10-19,7616520,Jennifer,"Tiberio has a lovely home.  It is as beautiful and creative as the photo suggests.  He cooked us a breakfast of eggs, roasted pumpkin squash and and a side salad with tomatoes from the garden.   I would love to stay with Tiberio again."
3208330,21897459,2014-10-26,22007966,Hilaree,"We received a warm welcome by Tiberio that showed us the place, it was simply perfect for us. A big, fully equipped and comfortable open space kitchen with nice couch next to the window for your last glass of wine. Tiberio leaves fresh eggs from his chickens every day, or if you prefer you can pick them up directly from the coop. Rooms and bathrooms are really clean. Really nice neighborhood at  only 10 mins from downtown and 5 mins from greenlake. Tiberio is really nice and loved to share with us his amazing recipes, including wild mushrooms he pick up everyday from the forest. He had good suggestions about things to do. Him and his place exceeded our expectations. If you want to be in a quite, clean and quality place near to main Seattle attractions...that's the place to be.
"
3208330,22030493,2014-10-28,21940000,Jacqueline," Both Tiberio and his place are warm and unique.  He's an incredible chef and it was wonderful to  watch him cook, watch him teach others and get to try his yummy food.  His place is full of personal and creative touches both in culinary and interior design.  A thoughtful host, Tiberio has been meticulous in setting up his place as an inviting bnb experience to remember.    "
3208330,22677935,2014-11-11,6689418,Claudia,My stay with Tiberio was so wonderful! Guest room is private and clean and comfortable. Location is good for public transportation so you don't need a car and he gave great directions from airport. He is very welcoming from the minute you step into his lovely home and an added bonus is he's an amazing chef! I would recommend staying there if you are going to Seattle.
3208330,32629537,2015-05-19,5993555,Nathanel,"Staying at Tiberio's home in Seattle was truly a wonderful and adventurous experience. My partner and I were in town to visit some friends and we needed a place that was comfortable and convenient. It was easy to jump on the bus on 8th Ave to head into downtown. Coming in from Canada, we arrived quite late. However, Tiberio was very flexible and welcoming. We were greeted with some delicious food that Tiberio prepared: smoked geoduck, smoked scallops, and a delicious lentil stew. The bedroom was spotless and very comfortable. Again, we were greeted with more snacks! Chocolate with nuts, home-made meringues, and scrumptious dried figs. Wow. Later we bumped into our host and he showed us his chickens and invited us to harvest some eggs the next morning. Again, Tiberio fed us with delicious treats: moist lemon cake, and home-made kombucha. Out of all of our stays with Airbnb, we've never had such a wonderful experience. Thank you Tiberio!"
3208330,33265043,2015-05-26,5163233,Diane,"Tiberio lives in a quiet, classic Seattle neighborhood; lots of fun houses to look at, close to bus, and easy walk to neighborhood shops.   He has made an amazing transformation of his own home, and the photos only begin to tell the story - wonderful!  Tiberio is a very welcoming and warm person, fun and interesting to converse with, very creative, very knowledgeable - especially concerning anything ""food"" - he also is very respectful of privacy.
Tiberio obviously goes the extra mile with preparation for guests - the house is very clean and tidy.  Also our room had a beautiful bouquet, comfy bed, and a very special tray of home made treats to welcome us.  Tiberio is  very creative with reuse and repurposing which is a delight to notice - he is also a forager and we witnessed the entire wood table you see in the picture covered with morels!!  Thats alota morels!!  He made us a delicious midnight snack of the most perfect Morel Carbanara ever, and then taught us how to make it, as well."
3208330,34089797,2015-06-04,6001984,Pierre,"Tiberio was incredibly gracious. He provided us breakfast, great conversation, and shared some wonderful stories. He invited us to a dinner party with his friends! Just an incredibly warm, cheerful person. The house is beautiful and in an incredible location. We were able to easily get around and enjoy all of Seattle. Of the many AirBnB's we've stayed at, this is easily one of the best. Tiberio is simply an incredible host and a joy to be around. "
3208330,34347671,2015-06-07,742971,Freeman,"Do not hesitate to book this place! Tiberio is a REALLY cool guy. He was very friendly and eager to share his passion for good food! He even cooked us an amazing lunch on our arrival.

His home is conveniently located near downtown Seattle and is one of the most unique Airbnbs we've ever seen. 

I wish we could've stayed longer! Hopefully we'll get the chance to stay at his place again next time we're in the Seattle area."
3208330,34801134,2015-06-12,17364953,Nathaniel,"Tiberio is absolutely fantastic. We had an excellent experience. The room is very private, on the top floor around a staircase. Incredibly unique culinary experience, given that Tiberio operates a cooking school and urban farm out of his home! He was more than willing to let us try out anything he happened to be making, and often left delicious ""treats"" for us to sample. Very convenient to public transport, and has bikes available to his guests! Honestly, I can't recommend Tiberio enough!"
3208330,35226883,2015-06-16,32910879,Paul,Our stay with Tiberio was an excellent experience.  Tiberio was a gracious host and made us feel comfortable.  He was very helpful with questions on where to eat and what to do.  His place is in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to a great little shopping/eating area.  Tiberio's house was immaculately clean and the room was spacious and private.  I think the best thing about staying with him was his interest in us feeling comfortable.  I was impressed that he asked what he could do better or how he could improve our experience.  I know if I ever go to Seattle again I want to stay at Tiberio's.
3208330,35408966,2015-06-18,28823792,Kanako,"Amazing amazing Tiberio. Wonderful host, excellent chef, great friend (also has green thumbs).
My husband, my 2 year-old son and I stayed for two nights at Tiberio’s beautiful, clean, interesting and cozy house. We really wished we would have stayed longer. He was so generous even to offer us to use his king sized bed in the master’s bedroom for he was worried for my son to fell off the bed upstairs, but the bed was big enough and comfortable. Also, Tiberio let my son pick up the eggs from the chicken coop (my son loved your chickens), made us delicious dinner with fresh veggies from his garden and fresh eggs from the coop and... (I could list up all the menu, but it will be long), shared great conversation with his company,,,, Ah! lots to say, but my heart is full with happiness. Everything happened at Tiberio's was perfect.

Thank you Tiberio, we love you (and we will be back)

Kanako, Sergio & Shintaro"
3208330,35821592,2015-06-22,2618694,Barbara,"Tiberio wasn't able to be there when we first arrived due to a friend's emergency, but he left clear instructions and had let us know in advance.  His home is colorful and comfortable, and well located.  We enjoyed our stay there very much and would recommend it to others."
3208330,36378536,2015-06-28,30653192,Rebecca,"Tiberio is a great, friendly, very interesting host with many interests, accomplishments and stories to tell. Nice quiet clean room and bathroom on their own floor. Woke up each day in quiet neighborhood with basket of fresh eggs from his chickens (quiet) to make breakfast in an amazing,  unique kitchen.  Bus into downtown Seattle 1 block away.  Really nice town along Greenwood Ave. 3 blocks away. Can walk to Enterprise car rental.  Took amazing day trips to Paradise in Mt Rainier NP and to Hurricane Ridge in Olympic NP. Highly recommended! "
3208330,36824351,2015-07-01,35909558,Melissa,We had an Amazing time and Tiberio was so thoughtful and gracious! We had everything we needed and his location is perfect! 
3208330,37394102,2015-07-06,36727943,Matthew,"Tiberio was a great host! His home is beautiful, he is obviously very passionate about the art of cooking.

I would highly recommend staying at his home!"
3208330,38175655,2015-07-13,7716627,Anna,"Tiberio's house was one of the most interesting, creative places I have ever stayed. He has transformed his home into a culinary experience!! Thank you for offering this place to visitors of the great city of Seattle. We were sorry that missed meeting you! "
3208330,38925346,2015-07-19,37739057,Holly And Josh,"We loved everything about Tiberio's! Including Tiberio! The house is amazing... Full of character, yummy snacks (love the Kampucha!), and thoughtful touches (like the prosecco & treats at our arrival for our anniversary!). The neighborhood is a foodie capital and Tiberio's bikes made it easy to get around!  We will be back for sure!!
"
3208330,39295451,2015-07-22,1685871,Diana,"First my communications with Tiberio had some Italian exchanges so that was fun, but then he started addressing me as ""darling"" and ""dear"" and that was odd since we didn't know each other. But then somehow there was a lot of miscommunication because he said he wasn't going to be there but that a friend would meet me. When I got there there was no one and I sat waiting in 100 degree heat on the porch. When I finally got a text back (thru airbnb) I had already left the porch and gone to find dinner. I returned in the dark and the house was all dark. I had to figure out the key system and let myself in. All the windows were shut tight and it was boiling inside. No fans in sight and no AC. The room, especially at night, does not look bright and cheery as it does in the pix. Black linens and black curtains make it very goth seeming. And pictures of things on fire on the walls. It was creepy being there alone and very hot without fans. I saw no one for my whole visit. And the location without a car would be very far from most anything."
3208330,39733994,2015-07-26,12926118,Sue,"The house inside and out is colorful. We were greeted by a lush vegetable garden in the front yard along with the tallest of sunflowers. We did not meet Tiberio during our visit but we did talk briefly with Dario, who was quite pleasant and gave us a tip for a sushi restaurant. The room was comfortable and we sampled fresh eggs one morning. The location is convenient to several different neighborhoods."
3208330,40628380,2015-08-01,16832356,Lily,"Tiberio is a great host! He made us feel at home the moment we arrived and also for the rest of the trip! The bedroom is clean, well decorated, and very comfortable and offers total privacy as well with its own bathroom. Room stays cool at night if you keep the windows open during the summer and Tiberio also got us a fan for the room before it got hot outside (high of 90 during the day). 

The kitchen is great and has a lot of character. There was also some breakfast foods and fruits for us in the fridge, which was wonderful! 

Dario (other housemate) also gave us a lot of great suggestions on places to see and see in the city, which were spot on! There are also bikes at the house which you can take, which we took full advantage of! 

Overall I highly recommend staying at Tiberio's house. You'll love it! "
3208330,40998553,2015-08-03,18995004,Florabeth,"Tiberio was the BEST! When we first arrived, he invited us to drop our bags and try out all of the amazing food he was preparing. The following days were full of a great sleep in a cozy room, more good food, and plenty of entertaining conversation. Neighborhood is continently located. Parking is easy. Highly recommended. Thanks, Tiberio! "
3208330,44537695,2015-08-27,36918783,Sovilia,It was great experience in staying at Tiberio's. He is very warmful and kind in improving guests' travel experience. If you enjoy cooking and having party，Tiberio is a very nice choice！
3208330,45530844,2015-09-03,39333424,Peihao,Tiberio is awsome! as well as his house! I will definitely recommend to my friend who want to travel to Seattle.
3208330,48424530,2015-09-26,11132047,Brad,"I booked Tiberio's place for my employee Bryan, who had this to say, 
""I had a great time staying at Tiberio's house. It was walking distance for everything I needed during my stay. The freshly picked pears were an added bonus.""

Bryan did note that this is definitely a ""unique"" spot (and host), both with a lot of personality. He enjoyed the flavor, but it may not be for those seeking a less colorful, more ""generic"" experience."
3208330,48794031,2015-09-28,10101850,Nishat,"Tiberio's home was not only beautiful but full of a great energy. He was welcoming, friendly, and full of great stories. The neighborhood was perfectly situated between Phinney, Wallingford and Ballard... with loads of tiny book shops, cafes, unique stores... it was a perfect get away in a quiet neighborhood still close to everything! Having a private bathroom was nice too. The best surprise was Tibero cooked a dinner for us, which was divine, and we exchanged stories about travel and life. Would definitely return here. Cheers and thank you!!!"
3208330,49072774,2015-09-30,3903741,Ariel,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3208330,49840819,2015-10-06,25511756,Battered Persons' Advocacy,"Tiberio was an excellent host. He was very welcoming and checked in with me to make sure that I had what I needed. One night he even invited me to eat dinner with him and his friends. The meal he prepared came from the food he grew in the garden. The food was great and the company was very pleasant :) . The place itself is very creatively decorated, very clean, and in a nice, cute neighborhood. You will notice all the artistic touches from the front porch, to the inside, all the way to the backyard. Even though the street looked full of cars, I never had an issue finding parking, regardless of the time of day or night. There is a cute little park down the street that was great for yoga and hula hooping. The neighborhood also was very safe to walk in (As a woman travelling alone, I found that to be very important). I would recommend this place! Enjoy your stay :) "
53867,122195,2010-10-18,258932,Ryan,"Kevin and Jennifer's place was all we could have asked for.  It is like a private cottage getaway but within walking distance to Husky Stadium.  They were extremely helpful and gracious on short notice.  We enjoyed our seclusion, high-end features, wi-fi, and first rate hospitality.  Great family, great place, amazing price.  What more could you want?   "
53867,134916,2010-11-07,244900,Katerina,Thank you for your hospitality. I appreciate the quite and quality of the comfort at Jennifer's place! 
53867,139384,2010-11-15,274827,Rachael,"Kevin and Jennifer's backyard bungalow is comfy, clean, private, spacious, well-stocked and well-situated.  It is well worth the (affordable) price and exactly what we'd hoped it would be!  Thanks, guys...we'll returning sooner rather than later! "
53867,141844,2010-11-20,248194,Deva,"I highly recommend Kevin and Jennifer.  Their place is great: spacious, convenient to bus access downtown, and, within walking distance to Ravenna's great neighborhood restaurants.  They provided spot-on recommendations for places to go and were very helpful about sharing information about their neighborhood.  They were very responsive regarding logistics and very easy to communicate with.  Thanks for introducing me to your neighborhood!"
53867,144425,2010-11-25,249554,Melanie,Thank you for a wonderful experience in Seattle!!  We arrived during the Great Blizzard of 2010 and Jennifer could not have been more helpful helping us to get to their house.  We woke up in the morning and found Jennifer shoveling snow off of our front steps!!  The house was immaculate and the wifi was very convenient!  Thank you for your hospitality.  Melanie and Wayne.
53867,145264,2010-11-27,1199201,Judy Arielle,"Clean and comfortable apartment in a small cottage in the backyard of Kevin and Jennifer's house. Nice arrangement with small kitchen, sitting area, and very comfortable queen sized bed in the loft area with ladder access. Located on a quiet neighborhood street."
53867,177693,2011-02-02,123049,Evan,"I loved staying there - clean, quiet, private.  "
53867,182085,2011-02-14,294718,Jim,"We arrived earlier than planned, but Jennifer was most obliging. We thought the accommodation was very comfortable; there were books to read, the shower was hot, the bed was comfy and the location was excellent. We will definitely return for a longer stay. Very helpful hosts."
53867,206202,2011-03-22,369459,David,"We enjoyed Kevin and Jennifer's house quite a lot. It was comfortably furnished and was every bit as pleasant as we hoped.

Bonus points for having books!"
53867,212557,2011-03-29,448603,Launa,We had a wonderful time exploring Seattle and our little bungalow made the whole experience perfect!  The Bungalow and loft in the U District was exactly as the pictures portrayed it.  The owners were right on time with the responses to our emails and they were meticulous in the details of how to get there and where to park.  We would definitely stay there again and we will always use Airbnb whenever possible.
53867,216130,2011-04-03,456575,Michele,We loved Jennifer and Kevin's loft bungalow.  It was adorablely decorated  and very comfortable..  Even the ladder up to the bedroom was fun- and we are not young folks.  We're hoping we can stay there again soon.
53867,222815,2011-04-11,287852,Julia,"Just returned from a stay at the McCollum cottage, and it was a wonderful experience. The cottage was so cozy, and was well-appointed with all the amenities we needed and even some bonus features (a Wii!). The location was ideal for exploring the nearby UW, as well as Seattle's other neighborhoods. Lots of yummy restaurants nearby too! It was great having our own mini-home, which allowed us to feel like temporary locals instead of just tourists. Would absolutely recommend the cottage and stay again. "
53867,231319,2011-04-19,354828,Dody,"Very comfortable and spacious mother-in-law apartment in back of main residence.  Private, quiet, all the comforts of home.  Fun loft area has comfy bed, desk, space for hanging/putting away clothes, extra linens & towels.  Jennifer even purchased an iron and ironing board for me when I asked about it.  Thankyou, Jennifer!  Lovely bath with luxurious towels, space to put away toiletries, and lots of hot water.  Clean and modern --- a wonderful place to stay.  Thanks!"
53867,240690,2011-04-26,278618,Diana,"I was looking for a quiet, relaxing place to stay. I also deliberately chose a cottage--a separate building, rather than a bedroom in a host's house--for quiet and privacy. Although this cottage is very neat and attractive, my stay was not that enjoyable, for the following reasons.

*I had explicitly reviewed my departure date & time with the hosts in email, ahead of time, but on my penultimate day there was a knock on the cottage door; the host wanted to know, in some puzzlement,""Are you... spending the night here?"" When I said yes, and that I was checking out at 5 the next day as per our previous arrangement, he said, ""We have someone coming at 3.""  It struck me as unprofessional and disorganized. To know that I was spending the night, all they had to do was check their own AirBnB listing, which showed the correct date. To know the check-out time, all they had to do was check the email they had written to me the week before. 

* As one host said to me when I arrived, they were ""having work done on the house."" This meant there were hammers and power tools in use throughout the weekend. I'd have stayed elsewhere, if given that information ahead of time. As it was, my only choice was to like it or lump it. 

*The hosts gave me their phone number, but didn't check their messages frequently. To contact me, they knocked on my door, which was essentially my bedroom door. When I stayed at a different but similar AirBnB--mother-in-law garage apt, separate from the main house--that other host and I had used voice mail & text to communicate. 

It was unsettling to have a host standing at my door, wanting me out. They backed off, but it was a very uncomfortable moment. They could have spared me that by looking at their own email and their own AirBnB dashboard. The power-tools noise was inconsiderate; it's not my year-round house, it was my vacation spot. 

I left their cottage in good order: I washed my dishes, took out the trash, etc, but while there I dropped my clothes on the floor and left the bed unmade. I was on vacation, after all. But with the hosts at my door so frequently, I felt uncomfortable about my private space. "
53867,246937,2011-05-01,514167,Jessica,We were in Seattle for a week searching for a place to live for an upcoming relocation. The backyard cottage was awesome and in the perfect location! It was quiet and and quaint....and Kevin and Jennifer were excellent hosts! Thanks a bunch for letting us stay with you guys! 
53867,255541,2011-05-08,287852,Julia,"Another great stay at the McCollum cottage! Spent more time exploring the neighborhood this time, and found a nice natural foods grocery store very nearby, as well as more cool restaurants and shops. Kevin and Jennifer are wonderful hosts, and their cottage is a delightful place to stay. "
53867,274397,2011-05-22,395868,Catherine,We absolutely loved our stay with Kevin and Jennifer!  Everything we could possibly need was in the bungalow which was incredibly clean and welcoming!  Our visit to Seattle was perfect and we highly recommend staying here!  Thank you for everything!  :)

53867,320453,2011-06-18,555856,Laura And Mike,"Kevin and Jennifer were perfect hosts. The loft was exactly as described and I loved the ladder up to the bedroom. Everything we may have needed was there for us (even tea and coffee in the cupboard!) We had a great stay here. Quiet, clean and comfy."
53867,326129,2011-06-21,354828,Dody,My 2nd stay in Jennifer and Kevin’s bungalow was just as wonderful as my 1st!  Many thanks!
53867,332333,2011-06-24,408132,Ian,"My stay here was quite nice. I used it as a ""hotel"" during a quick work trip. There's easy access to bus lines that will take you to the U-district (which is walkable, though far-ish) and downtown. The cottage itself is great and exactly as the pictures show. I'd stay here again if I ever need to!"
53867,345193,2011-07-01,411678,Philip,"We had a wonderful time staying at Kevin & Jennifer's Loft. Privacy would most likely be the best way to describe it. We had the space to ourselves for the the five nights that we stayed. The Loft is 5 minutes away on bike from the Burke-Gillman Trail. Remember that if you are taking off from the house on bike, you'll be coming uphill on the way back. If I can do it, then mostly anybody can. Plus you can simply drive to your start point if you don't want to climb the hills. 

The water heater was great as well. As soon as you turn the shower on, the water is heated and ready to go. No running out of hot water here.

 It was perfectly located outside of downtown Seattle and surounding towns like Bellevue and Redmond. Which we visited a couple times during our trip. Our trip was primarily to watch baseball and bike, and the Loft suited us well for our activities. 

The neighborhood is filled with older nicer houses with a lot of character and charm. The kind of houses where if you fix up, you can make a lot of money.  Which leads me to my one negative of our stay regarding the place. It didn't bother us much, but I thought it might be good to mention. We came back to the Loft after a couple hours out to find a small table saw and saw dust camped in front of the entry way to the Loft. We both looked at each other, and were a little puzzled on why we were not made aware of this. I'm thinking there was a little remodeling going on in the main house. But, this would have been good to know. The contractor was unaware as well that we were staying, but it seemed like he did his best to keep the noise down. The occasional sound of a table saw didn't really bother us at all. We look at it as a sound you'd most likely here in a neighborhood, and it beats hearing traffic outside a hotel window. 

 Overall, this was well worth the money that we spent, and would definitely recommend this to someone planning to stay in the Seattle area. We'd take a small charming loft over a hotel room that would have most likely cost at least twice as much. Thanks Kevin & Jennifer.

Philip and Andrea"
53867,365650,2011-07-11,572519,Michael (And Kelly),"This was a great experience!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  For a couple of ""healthy"" retirees we found the loft easy to negotiate.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who needs to get up in the middle of the night unless you have a patient bladder.  However, they also offer an alternative for the downstairs.  The unit is clean, comfortable and well appointed.  It's in a great location if you don't need to be downtown.  It's very convenient for shopping, restaurants and freeway access.  We would look for this property again in the future."
53867,382660,2011-07-19,563949,Mary-Pat & David,"We really enjoyed our stay near U of W with Kevin & Jennifer. We actually never met Jennifer but Kevin was most cordial, even offering to let us check in early because of having to carry our luggage around Seattle. (We actually ended up just leaving it longer @ the Amtrack station & picking it up later). Kevin checked in with us to make sure everything was going okay but didn't  hover over us during our stay of four nights. They had a nice comfortable set-up & having access to WII sports & movies was an extra bonus. They were very helpful in making recommendations for bus lines, stores & restaurants nearby. We especially appreciated their loaning us a blanket to take to the Mariners evening baseball game. We'd definitely stay here again!
PS: loved the WELCOME chocolates!"
53867,394650,2011-07-25,368806,Peter,"Has all of the attributes we look for in a ""home away from home"":  clean, quiet, private, and with a spacious, fully-appointed kitchen.  We especially appreciated the environmentally-friendly aspects of the cottage (on-demand hot water and heated floor).  We'll be back!  Thank you for a wonderful stay."
53867,414410,2011-08-02,571546,Michele,This was a great place for my daughter and I.  There was a fantastic lake a couple minutes away to run or walk around.  Very accessible to downtown and fairly easy to avoid traffic.  There was a problem with the stove upon arrival - but the owner went above and beyond compensating for that small issue.  I would definitely stay here again.
53867,419653,2011-08-04,808431,Phil,"Kevin and Jennifer were super friendly and welcoming. The living space is perfect. Private entrance, kitchen, washroom, - what else could you ask for? Will recommend and come back for sure when visiting Seattle. Thanks again for a perfect stay."
53867,429457,2011-08-08,873958,Anna Caroline,Thanks Jennifer and Kevin. The bungalow was perfect for our stay. We enjoyed having a kitchen and living space to hang out and relax. The loft with the bed was cozy and comfy. Very convenient bus stop just out the door to downtown and more.
53867,435521,2011-08-10,912450,Andrea,"A great place to stay - super clean, quiet, private. This was our first time using Airbnb and if every place is as great as this one I would use it all the time. Much better than any hotel in the area. Thanks so much to the great hosts. "
53867,438398,2011-08-12,206203,Amanda,"Kevin and Jennifer are great hosts.  They had perfect nearby restaurant suggestions and the instructions for the place were clear and easy to follow.  Their backyard bungalow is comfortable, nicely decorated, has a complete kitchen, and was pretty quiet considering how close they are to many wonderful attractions.  I slept really well, always a challenge when away from home. It was a good value and I would stay there again."
53867,449291,2011-08-16,327485,Renee,This is well located on the 71 very helpful for getting downtown and to the U district. Pies and Pints is nearby - tasty !  The place is clean and surprisingly large. 
53867,459503,2011-08-20,575704,Roger,Coral and I really enjoyed our stay. The cottage/loft was cozy and clean. The bed comfortable and the kitchen as fully equipped as one would need for a few night. Great place where we would happily stay again.
53867,465395,2011-08-22,814555,William,We had a great stay. Great location. Nice neighborhood!
53867,472029,2011-08-24,758029,Ellice,"Kevin & Jennifer's bungalow is simply delightful—clean & quiet. Though there was a little hiccup on checking in, they took care of the situation straight away. And not only did they act upon it, so did their lovely neighbors!"
53867,483461,2011-08-29,763836,Anne,"Lovely space, quiet neighborhood.  Very relaxing!"
53867,490329,2011-08-31,368806,Peter,"This is just a great little cottage!  I enjoyed my second stay even more than my first.  Thanks, Jennifer and Kevin, for another wonderful stay."
53867,497024,2011-09-03,338730,Renée,We loved this private little backyard cottage. It was just great as the listing suggested and located conveniently just north of the UVillage. We would definitely book here again next time we return to Seattle.
53867,510613,2011-09-07,837389,Selena,"Best place for the location and price.  Worked perfectly for my needs since my brother lives close by and i couldn't stay with him.  So my boyfriend and I just slept, showered and ate in the little kitchenette there.  It was perfect."
53867,519474,2011-09-10,660326,Chanel,"This was an excellent accommodation. I have no complaints. Although, I would warn people if they have any balance issues, that going up and down the loft may be a little worrisome.

Otherwise, the small space is well appointed and organized. Perfect size for one or two people. The ""instant"" hot water heater for the shower is lovely."
53867,559624,2011-09-23,1003052,Christian,"It's a really nice place! Only good things to say about. Quiet, clean, private and very convenient. I got good tips form Jennifer about the nearby location. I'll come back next time!"
53867,597528,2011-10-04,183069,Derek,"Really enjoyed our stay here. The cottage is clean, comfortable and perfect for couples. It's in a nice neighborhood and it's easy to access the main parts of Seattle. The hosts are accommodating, thanks Kevin and Jennifer!"
53867,605184,2011-10-06,502164,Carrie,Jennifer and Kevin's apartment was great-- super cute and awesome location. They were very flexible in taking a last minute reservation. Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating about check-out. Great experience!
53867,620695,2011-10-11,236915,Rebecca,"Great quiet place to stay.  We were very happy with our stay.
Don't be afraid of the loft bedroom.  We were able to
use the ladder without any problem.  Comfortable bed.
Slept like babies.


"
53867,638802,2011-10-17,1243085,Susan,Kevin was a welcoming host.  The cottage was in a very quiet neighborhood conveniently near a bus line that takes 30 minutes to get downtown.
53867,690930,2011-11-04,951672,Dan,"What a great place to crash. The cottage was very clean and comfortable with plenty of personal touches to make it feel like a ""home away from home"". The wireless internet and flat screen TV/DVD allowed us to kick back and relax. The loft made the experience memorable. Parking was convenient. Traveling to points beyond was simple as the interstate was easily accessible. You are close to grocery stores and bus lines. There was even a great breakfast cafe within two blocks  We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle in the ""backyard cottage & loft""."
53867,710444,2011-11-11,1376959,Chuan,Quiet neighborhood and clean cottage.
53867,718647,2011-11-14,1347321,Casey,The McCollum Cottage was a great place to stay. It was immaculately clean and inviting. Great kitchen and T.V. It was very cozy.
53867,729610,2011-11-19,600025,Carl,Very comfortable  accommodations. We especially liked the radiant floor heat. Thanks for having us. 
53867,733052,2011-11-21,1089570,Benny,Great location and great neighborhood. Ten minutes from downown and everything you need within five minutes from the cottage. Great host as well!
53867,753582,2011-11-29,1351100,Richard,"Kevin and Jennifer have a wonderful cottage in a great location. We very much enjoyed their quiet home and we had no problems with the loft ladder. However, we did play it safe by closing the trap door when we were in the bedroom. Highly Recommended!!"
53867,763863,2011-12-05,236915,Rebecca,Great stay. As usualy quiet and private.
53867,779821,2011-12-12,1429853,Idona,The Cottage was perfect for our short stay.  The ladder to the bedroom was a bit difficult in getting suitcases upstairs but the Cottage was really nice and clean and the heated floors were great for those cold Seattle mornings!  Thanks Kevin and Jennifer for a great place to stay!
53867,790076,2011-12-17,652569,Elizabeth,"Kevin and Jennifer's place was beautiful, clean, and welcoming. A perfect space to relax. Heated tile floor, flat-screen TV, kitchenette, loft - plenty of space and plenty of privacy."
53867,858990,2012-01-12,623886,Nicole,"Kevin and Jennifers loft was just as described, really cozy and only 10  minutes from dowtown. A 15 minute walk or 5 minute drive from the University Village which had food places and shopping outlets and a fresh fruit market just down the street. The only downside was that the bottom level was really really cold at night but once we moved the heater down from upstairs it was fine. Would stay again :)"
53867,868703,2012-01-17,1568897,Dustin,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay here. The place was clean, warm, and  a great size for two people. We really liked the free parking, and thought the location was perfect. Excellent value for the price!

Although we never met Kevin and Jennifer, they were very friendly and also accommodating (letting us check-in early). 

Thank you for hosting us!"
53867,877820,2012-01-23,1131399,Clara,"My boyfriend and I happened to book our Seattle trip during the historic snowstorm that hit Seattle.  After a complicated mess of trying to get into the city, we were really happy with the cottage-it was warm, inviting and perfect for us.  The bed was comfy and the heated floors were nice.  Jennifer/Kevin were very accommodating and friendly.  Their neighborhood is lovely and the area is a lot of fun.  Thank you!"
53867,886999,2012-01-28,373340,Casey,"The backyard cottage and loft was fantastic.  I stayed while on business in Seattle, and it was perfect.  I loved the loft bedroom, and the bed was crazy comfortable.  I was also great using the Wii Fit to get in a little exercise during my visit.  I definitely plan on renting w/ them again."
53867,894503,2012-01-31,537902,George,"Kevin and Jennifer Mccollum's backyard cabin was a perfect fit for me, my wife, and 17 month old daughter.  It is tastefuly decorated and situated in a very cool, hip, and vibrant neighborhood, only 15 minutes from downtown Seattle.  Kevin was prompt in responding to all my questions prior to our visit and was extremely flexible in allowing my family to check-in early.  We met Jennifer towards the end of our weekend trip.  She came by to say hello as we were leaving and gave clear instructions how/where to leave the keys.

One quick note, if traveling with a baby or a pregnant wife/gf, make arrangements with Kevin or Jennifer before your arrival to borrow their air mattress.  My wife was at the end of her second trimester when we visited Seattle.  As excited as we were to make use of the loft style bedroom (one of the reviews described the experience as ""like being in a tree house"" --- VERY TRUE), accessing the bedroom by use of the ladder proved too difficult for my very pregnant wife after the first night.  The air mattress came in very handy.   

Overall an awesome experience, and we'll gladly rent their place again for our next Seattle trip."
53867,918715,2012-02-13,719353,Martt,"I really enjoyed this clean, well maintained apartment.   I appreciated the kitchenette since I like to have at breakfast at home and I like the possibility of making food rather than going out while I'm traveling. The heated floors  and wireless internet provided the extra bit of luxury that make this place a find. I will choose it over a hotel for my next Seattle visit. 

Though this stay was perfect for me, I would not recommend it to an elderly or handicapped person as getting up the ladder to the bedroom loft may be a challenge."
53867,940647,2012-02-22,870030,Jeana,"Kevin and Jennifer's cottage was clean, warm, pleasantly-lit and remarkably quiet. They were very kind and let me stay a little later than their posted check-out time. I found it surprisingly easy to get downtown by both bus and car, and the Bose sound system was a real treat. I'd definitely stay there again!"
53867,953636,2012-02-27,1741434,Jason,"This is a wonderful place to stay in a great location. The neighborhood is very walkable and is convenient  to the the UW or downtown via public transit or car. The accommodation itself is warm, light -filled and cozy. Our hosts were quite nice as well. "
53867,960681,2012-02-29,1810331,Eric,"This was Eric and Liz's first experience with Airbnb and we feel we lucked out tremendously. The pictures perfectly depict the space; the small apartment is cozy, warm, and spotless. Jennifer is lovely and was hospitable upon our arrival and everyone was patient with our quite late check out. Had we the option, we would have stayed here longer. The proximity to Seattle is also just right - not in the thick of things, but convenient and quiet. All in all, a real pleasure to end our cross-country road trip. Thank you!"
53867,1013595,2012-03-18,1131399,Clara,"We were back for a 2nd stay at the cottage and loved it!  My bf and I travel to Seattle often, and the McCollum Cottage is our #1 favorite spot to stay.  Immaculately clean, warm floors, perfect location.  Thanks again!!!"
53867,1034164,2012-03-23,1286965,Deborah,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at their cozy cottage.  It was the perfect size for the two of us and the bed was VERY comfortable.  Jennifer was also very helpful with giving us some great seafood restaurant recommendations.  We would definitely stay her again. : )
53867,1077487,2012-04-03,515323,Mary,"Compact and convenient, this cottage was perfect for our needs.  We loved having WI-FI access, and Kevin and Jennifer were friendly hosts.
We wouldn't hesitate to book with them again!"
53867,1125863,2012-04-13,2077630,Micaela,"We had a lovely stay at Kevin and Jennifer's U-district backyard cottage. The cottage is clean and fresh. The bed is warm and cozy. WiFi works like a charm! If you are looking for a place in the U-district but away from the hustle and bustle of the Ave, I would highly recommend a stay at the cottage.
 "
53867,1137087,2012-04-16,1922779,Amy,"The cottage was perfect! Very cozy and clean. I didn't actually get a chance to meet Kevin and Jennifer, but they seemed very available if we needed anything during our stay. This was my first time in Seattle and I wasn't familiar with any of the areas, but the cottage was in a great location. There's a good bit of shopping and restaurants nearby, but it's out of the way enough that traffic and parking isn't really an issue. I love that the cottage is more comfortable than a hotel, but I didn't feel like I was invading anyone's space (or them invading mine :) by staying in their house. I'd definitely stay again!"
53867,1157024,2012-04-20,410314,Anonymous,"This location was fantastic!  Close to university, metro, restaurants, shopping, etc.   The unit was very quiet and private.  I would definitely stay again."
53867,1170166,2012-04-23,595523,Christine,The mother-in-law apartment was comfortable and clean and convenient. I will definitely return for another stay.
53867,1197341,2012-04-29,2120897,Rita,"Love this cottage! After a 3 hour flight delay, we arrived to a quaint, clean, and cozy cottage. Check-in/out was simple and the bed was an absolute dream! The location is fantastic and we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you Kevin & Jennifer for the tranquil cottage stay!!"
53867,1254407,2012-05-09,1891520,Matt,"Kevin and Jennifer were great!  Jennifer gave me a brief, but thorough orientation.  They were always available had I needed anything, but truth be told, the cottage was so well-equipped that I didn't need a thing during my stay.  The cottage is also in a great location!  I will definitely try to stay here again on future visits to Seattle.  "
53867,1293534,2012-05-17,1839871,Red,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at the McCollum cottage. Kevin and Jennifer were gracious hosts, and very responsive to our needs. With the addition of their air mattress, the cottage slept two guests very comfortably. Clean, quiet and in a young, vibrant area, this is the perfect location for those looking for a low-key getaway."
53867,1441303,2012-06-09,1799807,Monnee,"This was our first airbnb experience and it went swimmingly! I wish we could have enjoyed it more, but unfortunately we were running around most of the time with graduation festivities. 

A big thumbs up for the huge sink in the bathroom, the cute and helpful amenities that Kevin and Jennifer included (welcoming chocolate, soap, towels and a blowdryer!,) and the little kitchenette. We were starving one night and drove over to a local Safeway to get some microwavable goodies, so the set-up was perfect for our midnight snack. 

For those of you who like wearing heels, the driveway is a bit steep to get up to the cottage, so have a pair of sensible shoes so it's an easier climb. On that same note, we didn't have a problem at all with the ladder up to the loft, but keep in mind that it might present an issue for those who aren't as limber.

Great first experience, thank you Jennifer and Kevin. "
53867,1473705,2012-06-13,2238364,Joshua,Ash and I flew in - drove up to the cottage and walked right in. Everything had been prepared for us ahead of time. The Keys were on the counter and we were off doing Honeymoon Things. We both had an excellent experience for our first time in Washington. This trip we did not get to meet the McCollum's but I'm sure if we had they would have been just as pleasant as the cottage they had crafted for us. 
53867,1505663,2012-06-18,991375,Jessica,"Kevin and Jennifer were wonderful hosts! 
The location was perfect for us, it was close to the university and a bus ride away from the downtown attractions. We explored the Pikes Market in the day and came home to a warm cottage at night. The cottage provided a fully working kitchen with the cutest little stove! The hosts have a great eye for design. The furniture was comfy and the atmosphere was calming. I highly recommend this cottage! "
