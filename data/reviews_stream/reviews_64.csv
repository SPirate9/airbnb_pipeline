1246769,12032440,2014-04-21,12953120,Jamie,Dirk & Jaq were incredibly quick to reply! Their apartment was super clean and was a great location. We would definitely stay here again!
1246769,12195596,2014-04-25,3444920,Wenoah,"Dirk and Jaq were incredibly responsive and very accommodating, especially considering my plans were made with little notice. The condo was exactly as described and pictured, very clean and bright. Best of all was location, it was literally steps into the heart of downtown, and made it so much easier for me to get to my meetings especially with the rain and cold weather.

Thanks so much, would definitely stay again!"
1246769,12327396,2014-04-29,3372343,Rachel,We had a great time staying at Dirk and Jaq's place. Dirk was greeted us and gave us super helpful instructions on how to get around the city and great places to go and eat. We would stay here again for sure!
1246769,12632977,2014-05-06,12859818,David,"The apartment was in new condition and impeccably clean, as nice as our own home.  Very simple European design, no frills but tasteful.   Very secure entrance.  Quiet with the windows closed.   Very well outfitted.  Location was perfect downtown on Pike Street, next to Conference Center, close to Capitol Hill, easy walk west to water, south to Pioneer Place and Amtrak station,  and the other way to Tula's, a great jazz club.  If we ever come to Seattle for a few days again, we will want to stay here."
1246769,12970530,2014-05-16,10770010,Ronald BRUCE [Preferred Name],"Our host was both friendly and intent on providing us with the best information we needed to get around, the apartment was centrally located which made it easy to explore the city on foot with ease, and find public transport when needed.
The apartment was sufficient for our needs, although the kitchen could have had some utensils.
The bed was perfect and we slept really well, we certainly enjoyed our stay there.

1246769,13464042,2014-05-28,7283929,Alexander,"Great appartment, very modern, clean, and well-equipped. It has everything you need, plus it is centrally located both for downtown and for Capitol Hill. Shopping and dining options are all close by. Communication with Dirk and Jaq was very smooth. Overall: a very positive experience. "
1246769,13812504,2014-06-05,12710390,Huiyao,"My stay was great! The apartment was exactly like described, and it's close to downtown and other places via the rail. I would definitely stay there again."
1246769,13912358,2014-06-08,2024440,Bradley,"Thank  you Jaq & Dirk! We had a great time, especially meeting all the friendly neighbor dogs in the building! The place was just as we expected, and I rediscovered the beauty of Freeway Park after walking past it the last 20 years! We'll see you again in August!"
1246769,14146014,2014-06-13,10938064,Stephen,"The apartment lived up to its billing on airbnb.  Well located, good size accommodation, appropriately  appointed and good communications via email with the hosts.  The road outside is a little noisy, but it only took a few minutes to become acclimatised.  "
1246769,14393510,2014-06-18,14418430,Jo-Anne,"The place was just as listed.  The bed was comfortable, the kitchen well stocked and the towels fluffy.  We had one problems with the parking pass but it was resolved with a text or two in 30 minutes.  Even with the parking pass we usually had to park up near Boren Ave. 

Overall a good experience. 

We did have one problem that had nothing to do with the owners.  One night we parked a block down from the apartment under the overpass.  In the morning our rental car along with two other cars had their passenger windows smashed.  So don't park there."
1246769,14594414,2014-06-23,7851343,Tatjana,"First, the apartment looks exactly like in the pictures and is really spacious, well equipped and  clean. Moreover the location is perfect for visiting the city and we were able to make all our ways by foot. 
Jaq and Dirk were really helpful and the check-in was easy and convenient. The communication was prompt and uncomplicated. All in all it was a great stay and we would recommend to everyone. "
1246769,14951272,2014-06-30,4234554,Suping,"We had a great time staying at this apt - it provided is more space for our fmaily of four and it was very convenient having a kitchen and separate bedroom.  Jaq and Dirk are very helpful and responsive - when we noticed a few items missing upon arriving, they were very quick to deliver them to us, which was much appreciated. "
1246769,15137694,2014-07-03,2645844,Marc Nicolas,"We spent three nights in Dirk&Jaq's place in Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment is clean, spacious and had all the necessary amenities. We didn't get to meet Dirk&Jaq in person, but the check in went very smoothly and they communicated everything we needed to know well in advance. The location of the apartment is very convenient, close to Pike/Pine and with lots of restaurants and coffees in the vicinity. "
1246769,15440802,2014-07-09,11421646,Dyonisio,"Our stay in Seattle at Dirk & Jaq's apartment was wonderful! 

The apartment is spacious and is decorated with exquisite taste and has everything anyone could need on a trip. 
Dirk was very attentive and quick to serve us with everything we need."
1246769,15568218,2014-07-12,2042834,Adam,"Dirk & Jaq greeted us with true enthusiasm for visiting Seattle. The apartment is perfectly situated right in the middle of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Two unexpected apartment pleasantries: air conditioning and MEGA cable! We have friends who live in the Ballard area and we'll be staying with D&J again when our next trip to Seattle comes around the bend.
Nearby dining suggestions: Lil Woody's, Taylor Shellfish, and Sitka & Spruce."
1246769,15899829,2014-07-18,8587546,Giselle,"Dirk and Jaq made everything very easy with detailed instructions on how to find them. The apartment is well maintained in an excellent location, close to the convention centre. The whole feel of the apartment is very homey and is a great place to stay in Downtown Seattle."
1246769,16241547,2014-07-24,3792331,Stacey,"Great condo, loved the shower and the comfy bed! everything was very clean and tidy. the location of this condo is AWESOME! easy walk to waterfront, downtown, Pike Place, Capital Hill, etc. also public transportation is very close for those who don't like walking so much. we found some really fantastic food in the area as well: Mamnoon walk up window, Taylor Shellfish, Terra Plata, Pie Bar, Homegrown sandwiches, and Kaladi Brothers just to name a few. had a slight problem with parking in the area, not so great to deal with in the rain and on a Sunday, but it all worked out fine. we will definitely be back! :) "
1246769,16401434,2014-07-27,15395570,Jennifer,"Great location in Seattle. We  were able to walk to virtually everything we could want... restaurants, grocery, bars, market, downtown.  The apartment was clean, modern and well-equipped, just as presented in the pictures and description.  Dirk and Jaq were kind enough to accommodate a last minute request, which we certainly appreciated. It was nice to see so much information provided re the local area and attractions, plus thorough information regarding parking, public transit  and the building. Dirk & Jaq communicated a great deal of information prior to stay and although we didn't get to meet them on our arrival, they ensured we had all necessary information in advance of our arrival.  I would definitely recommend contacting Dirk & Jaq if you're looking for a small, well-equipped, convenient apartment in Seattle. "
1246769,16700719,2014-08-01,4423305,Aymone,"Dirk & Jaq condo was perfectly located, with most Seattle spotlights at walking distance. To go from/to the airport or further in town, the public transportation were really easy to access. Parking was quite easy thanks to the permit provided. The condo was roamy and nicely decorated with all the required appliances. "
1246769,17087750,2014-08-07,9737429,Caroline,"Very comfortable apartment, centrally located in the convention centre area. Great for bars and restaurants downtown and in first hill /Melrose areas.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  

Many thanks Dirk And Jaq"
1246769,17340342,2014-08-11,12335913,Aaron,"The Condo was great and exactly as advertised.  Clean and homey.  Outstanding location for downtown. We very much enjoyed our stay. Host took extra time to get us great directions with clear instructions to access the condo, big help with late arrival."
1246769,17559651,2014-08-14,7854334,Evelyne,"Dirk and Jaq were really nice. I didn't see them but they answered quickly my questions and they did all they could to make my stay very enjoyable.
There is a guidebook with all you need to know for the appartment or for visiting Seattle.
The appartment is clean, comfortable and close to the downtown. I never took metro or bus during my stay: you can walk and go easily to the downtown or the most of the attractions in Seattle.
I recommend Dirk and Jaq's appartment and if I come back in Seattle, I will definitely go back in their appartment.

Thank you for all Dirk and Jaq"
1246769,18054003,2014-08-21,15719976,Lou,"Our hosts were very helpful, and quick to respond to inquiries. We enjoyed our stay and, most of all, being arms' length away from so many great places to eat and visit."
1246769,18399315,2014-08-26,8067249,Paul,"The apartment was clean with a well equipped kitchen. Conveniently located across the convention center and nearby downtown and Pike market. A bit noisy with the windows open, but tolerable. A definite no-brainer."
1246769,18527516,2014-08-28,2024440,Bradley,This was our second stay here - and I'm sure we'll be back again! Thanks Dirk & Jaq for the great place!
1246769,19362350,2014-09-11,899568,Leah,"A perfect location, especially for access to the convention centre where I was participating in a conference. The apartment was perfect and beautifully equipped, and it was a real pleasure to be able to walk to the harbour front, the downtown area, the Capital Hill district and more in the balmy Seattle weather. Thankyou!"
1246769,19516955,2014-09-14,11251297,Jennifer,"Location location location! This condo was walking distance to every place worth going...Public Market, Capital Hill, Belltown, coffee shops, restaurants & bars/night clubs. The pictures is exactly what you get, a clean & updated condo. My husband & I are already talking about coming back with our kids."
1246769,19745939,2014-09-17,20730721,Noah,Dirk and Jaq did a great job making us feel welcome and making sure we had everything we needed. They contacted us well in advance and were just a text away if we had needed anything else.  
1246769,20004976,2014-09-22,17193270,Cassidy,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Dirk and Jaq set the bar high. Everything in the description was spot on and more. The location of the apartment was my biggest concern because I had never been to Seattle and it was described perfectly. It is walking distance to everything you could need, there was a very a handy guestbook for first timers like me. They were very responsive to touristy questions I had about Seattle as well. If I return to Seattle I will most definitely book this same location for the price, perks, and location."
1246769,20226089,2014-09-26,15752508,Amanda,"Awesome location - we walked everywhere and also had a very easy (and cheap) trip to the airport on the public transport. 
Although we didn't meet - the instructions on how to locate the apartment and the key were very easy. 
Very clean and well stocked apartment with everything we needed. Thanks for a great stay in Seattle "
1246769,20500207,2014-09-30,18827677,Minako,"Dirk & Jaq's property was great mainly due to it's location. You really don't need a car if the focus of your stay will be downtown Seattle. If you have a car or are planning to rent one be prepared for a rousing game of parking roulette. Even tough there was a guest parking pass for area 21 (51?) at our disposal finding a space was extremely challenging. This quest actually took a significant amount of time away from our stay.

Aside from the parking situation we liked the accommodations. The bathroom was very basic but the extra nice kitchen was a pleasant surprise. The bed was comfortable and we both enjoyed the reclining chair in the living room. It wasn't quite as bright in the apartment as it seems in the pictures but that wouldn't keep us from staying there again. The ultra bonus was the wonderful compendium of information that they have compiled to enhance the enjoyment of your stay."
1246769,20687381,2014-10-04,15365887,Hazel,"For two visitors on vacation from the UK this flat has the perfect downtown location - a few minutes walk from the central shopping area, and 20 minutes walk from Pikes Place, with the monorail station (to access the expo area) no more than 10 minutes away.

Access arrangements worked perfectly.  The flat was beautifully clean and more than adequately equipped for our 3 day stay.  The bed was comfortable and the lounge with large TV was relaxing.

The noise of traffic on the freeway nearby was to be expected and the price you pay for the great location.

Good to have the use of a visitors' parking permit, as parking police are VERY vigilant - we were given a $450 fine within minutes of arriving, our fault for parking in a confusing disabled parking area outside the flat!  Thankfully we spotted the ticket being slapped on the windscreen from the window and ran down and persuaded the kind policeman to take pity on us!  From then on we found (with difficulty at times) spaces within 10 minutes walk of the flat.

We'd be more than happy to return if in Seattle again.  Thank you to Jaq and Dirk for their prompt replies and use of their beautiful property."
1246769,20897931,2014-10-07,13393991,Stephanie & Joey,"We had an excellent experience during our stay in Dirk and Jaq's lovely apartment. It was comfortably and tastefully furnished. It was conveniently located within walking distance to the Capitol Hill neighborhood with tons of great dining and shopping. It is also an easy walk to downtown with even more dining shopping and Seattle attractions. The apartment was clean and quiet except for one late night furniture moving session by the neighbors above. But, we would definitely stay here again during our next visit to Seattle!"
1246769,21064643,2014-10-10,1923105,Steve,"Everything was exactly as shown on the website, no surprises. Dirk was readily available each time we contacted him and everything was super clean. All in all, nothing to complain about here!"
1246769,21193476,2014-10-13,15681073,Ev,"If you are attending a convention this is a great place to stay. It's barely a walk to get from the condo to the convention center. Also, you'll be able to save money by utilizing the kitchen - which had all the pots, pans and dishes we needed, even a french press for coffee in the mornings - instead of having to eat out every meal. 

The hosts' instructions on how to get in were fine, and everything was just where they said it was. It was very organized. They even provided a nice guest book with info on the area. Each page has duplicates in a plastic sheet so you can take the page with you if you find information you'll need while out and about.

The condo was very clean, and had great hot water heater, so no worries about being the last one in back-to-back showers. There was a little road noise - to be expected being so close to the freeway - but otherwise very quiet and peaceful. 

While the hosts very considerately provided a guest parking pass, finding street parking on a weekend was nearly impossible. I would recommend future guests use the loading zone down the street to take their things up and grab the pass before they start the epic search for parking. Mostly, this is because most of the street parking is up a steep hill from the condo and if you find a space you won't want to move your car or have to carry your bags down the hill. Fortunately, if you fail in your quest, as we did, there are several large parking garages nearby if you don't mind paying to park.

Finally, Dirk & Jaq were lightning quick to respond to any inquiries we had, which was greatly appreciated."
1246769,21417406,2014-10-17,11047977,Jenney,"Dirk and Jaq were very accessible.  What a delightful apartment!  Very comfortable, lots of tv and fast wireless internet.  Great location, I have several favorite places in the area.  Yes, yes book this place.  Thank you D n J."
1246769,21510618,2014-10-19,3388105,Carl,"This was our second stay at Dirk and Jaq's lovely apartment...the second stay was just as wonderful as the first! 
 
These hosts should give a workshop on how to run an AirBnB rental, or at least write a book on the subject.  They have provided a beautiful, clean, tastefully appointed apartment, in the best location in Seattle and have anticipated their guests every need.  The apartment manual is a labor of love, in it's own right!  The towels are plentiful, thick and thirsty, the kitchen cupboards are perfectly stocked, and the bed is so comfortable that we plan  to go mattress shopping as soon as we find out what we were sleeping on!

Dirk and Jaq responded immediately when we had a question and all of our contact with them has been friendly and gracious!  We wholeheartedly recommend this property and it is at the top of our list next time we spend time in Seattle!"
1246769,21700130,2014-10-22,16201645,Norman,Very pleasant apartment. The bed was very comfortable. Location was perfect. Access to the best parts of the city was easy.
1246769,22058090,2014-10-29,3022210,Anne,"Apartment was comfortable, warm, and spotlessly clean.  Everything we needed for preparing simple meals in the kitchen.  Small (if pricey) market right around the corner.  We didn't actually meet Dirk and Jaq, but they checked in on us by email and were extremely friendly and helpful, letting us know they were just around the corner if anything did come up.  We were there for a conference at the convention center, and the apartment is really just around the corner.  Very convenient, and we paid half the cost of a convention hotel room for a much roomier and more comfortable space.  Try Tango just up the street for tapas -- Tuesday it's happy hour all night!"
1246769,22228389,2014-11-02,19142045,Danielle,"This was the first time that my boyfriend and I had used airbnb, and Dirk and Jaq are so great! They are very communicative and thoughtful. The apartment that we stayed at was very clean, homey, and had everything we could possibly need (even an umbrella)! The apartment also had a guestbook which was super helpful -- laying out instructions for arrival/checkout, providing transit maps, and even a guest parking pass. Even before we arrived, Dirk and Jaq were very helpful. They let my boyfriend and I know how to get to the apartment from the Seattle airport and gave advice on how to get around town. "
1246769,22486068,2014-11-08,1261538,Peter,"This is a well appointed apartment very close to downtown, and about as close as you can possibly stay to the Washington State Convention Center. The apartment was clean, spacious, and even stocked with bathroom supplies. A prepared booklet provided useful facts that a visitor maywant to know, and the internet service was reliable and fast. Highly recommended."
1246769,22791106,2014-11-15,19026322,Petr,"Very good choice to stay in the city centre. We feel to be welcomed warmly, Dirk and Jaq comunicate very well, the apartment description and location was absolutely exact, no problem to find (website hidden) was clean and well prepared for us. Its surrounding seems quite safe and shielded by trees and convention centre from surrounding highway traffic noise."
1246769,22946462,2014-11-18,21401977,Jackie,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it went really well!  The space was exactly as listed and served my needs perfectly. I was in town for a conference at the Sheraton near the Convention Center and didn't want to stay at the boring hotel.  Dirk and Jaq's rental apartment was well located, very clean and had extra amenities (wi-fi, tv, kitchen with tea and coffee, extra toiletries) that were really helpful.  They also gave very clear instructions and check in/out was a breeze!  "
1246769,23361472,2014-11-30,10663012,Julie,"Dirk and Jaq were really accommodating, and the apartment was great for us. The check in process was very smooth, and they were very responsive to all my questions. The neighborhood is a short walk to Capitol Hill and the convention center area, and parking was easy to find. The hosts had everything we needed laid out, and the kitchen had all the essentials in terms of pots and pans. It was a great place to use as home base as we explored Seattle. "
1246769,23557849,2014-12-04,1000097,Erik,"I arrived very late at night, but it was easy following the instructions to get into the apt. It's in a very good location, easy walk to many good restaurants and never had to take a cab anywhere. Everyplace I wanted to go was in walking distance. Internet worked great, I was very comfortable."
1246769,23678368,2014-12-08,5928419,Meryl,"Friendly and attentive hosts, convenient location, nice amenities, clean/new interior."
1246769,23820352,2014-12-11,12334210,Ben,"Great place.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay close to the convention center and downtown.   The apartment was ample size, and the bed was very comfortable.  The windows are double pane; so, the street noise is minimized.

Dirk and Jaq were also always reachable for questions and to resolve any issues.  They were great hosts."
1246769,23937943,2014-12-15,16441336,Jan,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The location was great, a pleasant walk to Pike Place Market. There was enough sitting area to host 3 family members for a visit during the day and the kitchen was great. I loved the bed, super comfy with perfect pillows and lovely sheets. I would be happy to stay there again."
1246769,24094845,2014-12-19,10450182,Mey,"The place was exactly as described and looked just like the pictures. The hosts were wonderful. They were extremely helpful and informative. The apartment was comfortable and cozy, and it has everything you can possibly need. It was wonderful being walking distance from all of the attractions."
1246769,24322561,2014-12-26,979087,Victoria,"We enjoyed our stay in the apartment - there was lots of space, a great kitchen, and super comfy bed. 

It was very clean and warm, and had everything we needed. 

It is also really well located, really close to places we wanted to go, so we were able to walk to most central places like Pike Place market, the monorail etc. 

Dirk and Jaq kept in touch though unfortunately we didn't meet. Everything was really simple for getting in to the apartment."
1246769,24521972,2014-12-30,1677816,Kevin,"Very well located apartment, easy walk into town and down to the market. All as it looks in the photos. Dirk & Jaq offered lots of assistance in finding the place and getting settled in. Recommended."
1246769,24890431,2015-01-03,8905667,Elizabeth,Dirk and Jaq were great. They responded extremely fast to emails and made check-in very easy. Their apt was conveniently located to many neighborhoods in Seattle. They even emailed during our stay to check-in and make sure everything was fine. I would definitely recommend this place.
1246769,25232523,2015-01-10,23344255,Fahri,"It was fine, but sometimes very noisy. In the middle of the night, you can hear noises from outside. But, location is perfect."
1246769,25498165,2015-01-18,24214850,Atheer,"Dirk and Jaq were great hosts because they literally thought of everything. Their guest guidebook was incredibly helpful, especially when our ride to the airport canceled at the last minute and we were forced to take the train! They provided all of the necessities and more, making our stay as comfortable as possible. Little things like menus for restaurants that delivered to the apartment, and spare paper towels, etc made all the difference. Their listing was exactly as pictured and described, and we quickly felt right at home. 

The neighborhood was wonderfully close to everything we wanted to see! Short walks to great shopping areas and pike's place market, and quick uber/lyft rides to places like the Space Needle, EMP Music Museum, or the Aquarium. The only negative was that the neighborhood was indeed a bit noisy, with the sound of cars constant if you have the windows open (it gets pretty stuffy with them closed)."
1246769,25666542,2015-01-22,21232344,Chris,"Dirk & Jaq hosted my mom and grandmother at their Downtown apartment, and they had an excellent and comfortable stay. Very warm and cozy.  "
1246769,25924605,2015-01-30,1261538,Peter,"It was my second stay at this apartment, and as was the case last time, it was comfortable, clean and close to Seattle downtown. Recommended."
1246769,26055205,2015-02-02,3683433,Chris,"Jaq and Dirk have done a wonderful job creating a clean, quiet, comfortable get-a-way space in the heart of the city.  Although close to the hustle and bustle, it provides a little, sparkling clean cocoon for rest and relaxation.  The location is perfect for easy access to most everything Seattle has to offer and provides excellent lighting, plenty of electrical outlets, luxury linens, a functional kitchen, a great bed (even a room darkening shade in the bedroom), wi-fi, quality TV (I watched the Seahawk's disappointing Super Bowl loss) and the added benefit of a parking permit.
Although neither Jaq or Dirk were available when I arrived, their cleaning assistant met me (I showed up a bit early) and was very gracious and helpful.  I was able to find street parking where I left my car for the entire 3 days.  
I hope to return to this lovely place again soon.
"
1246769,26404815,2015-02-11,3867422,Laura,"Very easy check-in, convenient location, and the place was clean and comfortable. It's in a large building with thin walls so was a little noisy at times. Seems like many air bnb guests occupy the building. "
1246769,26588254,2015-02-16,23907713,Jaclyn,"Jaq and Dirk have mastered the art of Airbnb. The Elektra was perfectly situated, walking distance from literally everything we planned to see. As others have shared, the unit is exactly as pictured: neat, tidy, and well-equipped for a relaxing getaway! Although we did have the fortune of meeting our gracious hosts, check-in and check-out were easy breezy!"
1246769,27166900,2015-02-27,19403089,John,"Very convenient location, especially if you are attending a conference at the convention center or otherwise need to be close to downtown or Capital Hill.
The unit was well equipped, clean, and hosts were easy to contact.
Please note that the building is close to I5, so there can be some highway noise, though not bad with window closed. It is an older building, so you may hear the neighbors."
1246769,27373925,2015-03-02,28196324,Murphy,The apartment is excellent! The location is very good，we love the details in the apartment. The only thing we want to complain is there is some strange noise during midnight which is not Dirk & Jaq's fault.
1246769,27943397,2015-03-15,785595,Dan,Dirk & Jak were great and so was their apartment. All of their instructions were readily available and the they were eager to help at all times.
1246769,28375901,2015-03-23,17952841,Stephen,"Dirk & Jaq's apartment is the perfect example on how to do AirBnB the right way. You feel like you have checked into a Hilton hotel when you arrive.

Check in was simple and easy, we arrived to a very clean apartment and all the pictures give an accurate description of the place.

The apartment itself was very beautiful, spacious and comfortable with ample space and a very comfy bed. The kitchen was full service with a large fridge, stove, microwave, kettle and more. We even arrived to some amenities such as coffee and sugar. 

There were enough clean towels to last a months stay alongside cleaning products to ensure you don't feel like the place gets too dirty.  

The internet was fast and the cable TV had every channel you could ask for. Communication with Dirk & Jaq was quicker than if you had to call emergency services.

For all other AirBnB hosts out there, it is worth staying here just to experience a 5 star stay."
1246769,28773391,2015-03-30,10020294,Jessica,"The listing was just a lovely as described. Although we didn't meet in person, Dirk & Jaq did everything to make sure our arrival and stay was as stress free as possible.  The apartment is in a perfect location if you want to be in the heart of Seattle. You can get around walking or using the public transportation, which is very accessible. Do not worry if you are a light sleeper, the building and surrounding area are very quiet. "
1246769,29010235,2015-04-02,23085976,Christine,"Great place! Very conveniently located. Apartment is clean and comfortable, and directions on check in and check out were very clear. A great experience!"
1246769,29155622,2015-04-05,13305750,Renee,"Fantastic communication, comfortable stay. Perfect location if you want to attend an event at the convention center. "
1246769,29722596,2015-04-12,6801914,Matthew,"Although we didn't meet Dirk and Jaq in person, they were super responsive to our emails and very helpful. 

The apartment was fantastic: very clean, everything you'd need in the kitchen, cable TV, fast internet, comfortable bed and ideal location walking distance from a heap of amazing restaurants, bars, cafes and eateries in Capitol Hill. It's also right near 8 Limbs yoga studio and Xplore CrossFit box. 

We can't wait to come back to Seattle and wouldn't stay anywhere else. "
1246769,30089415,2015-04-17,5593928,Min,"This place was clean, very close to the convention center and the starbucks reserve roastery and tasting house. I enjoyed my stay."
1246769,30377185,2015-04-21,1624176,Neta,"This experience was perfect in every way. The apartment was spotless and just as described, check-in was seamless, communication was flawless, and the location couldn't have been better. Add to that glorious weather and a comfortable bed... Simply wonderful! ;  )
"
1246769,30674980,2015-04-26,10082639,Carlene,Dirk and Jaq were very accommodating. We needed a blender and they made sure we had one. The condo was just as described. Great location within walking distance to everything. 
1246769,31158240,2015-05-03,349979,Alister,Great location and quiet (double glazing on windows) fully equipped kitchen with tea/coffee and bathroom. Hosts very easy to contact-  clear instructions. Perfect. 
1246769,31695161,2015-05-09,17568962,Rachel,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was everything we hoped it would be! The hosts were always available, though truthfully we never needed anything since their instructions were extremely clear and the place was in perfect order. This unit is very convenient to the Convention Center and many neighborhood restaurants and local shopping. Thank you for giving us a wonderful place to stay! We'd definitely stay here again for a future trip :)"
1246769,32034985,2015-05-12,11189615,Patricia,"Apt was as described & we were able to 
make  the couch into a bed.  It is a minimalist 
apt in a good neighborhood.  Can walk to
Pike's Place Market.  Freeway Art is across
The street.  Easy to take buses, taxi or
Uber.  They have a parking pass which allows
street parking which was a great help."
1246769,32470663,2015-05-18,12963958,Stefano,"Great Apartment, clean and cozy in a very nice location. No problems at all."
1246769,32960486,2015-05-24,27246076,Harjot,"My wife and I stayed with our 9 month old and this place was just what we were looking for - comfortable, affordable, clean and convenient! The apartment had everything we wanted - wifi, umbrella, utensils, cable TV, etc. It's so easy to walk to convention center from here. Loved our stay here!"
1246769,33357232,2015-05-27,22932436,Susie,"The listing was accurate.
Pros: 
Clean
Spacious
All amenities
Great location
Hosts were very responsive via email, very important!"
1246769,34188029,2015-06-06,24495624,Emily,"Dirk and Jaq were great hosts. They were very contactable both before and during our stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean and functional, and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for us. "
1246769,34621295,2015-06-10,17980871,Brian,Dirk and Jaq were very responsive and welcoming. The apartment was clean and nice. Really convenient for conference center. 
1246769,34797081,2015-06-12,5839432,Luanne,"The location of this apartment is fantastic!  We were able to park our vehicle and walk to enjoy Seattle.  The listing is completely accurate and the communication was prompt.
Thank you for a great stay in Seattle!"
1246769,35065075,2015-06-15,27970122,Magdalena,This was our first experience using Airbnb! Dirk and Jaq made it SO easy. Their apt was within walking distance to practically everything. We also used the parking pass because we had a car for graduation weekend. The unit was clean and furnished with everything...even coffee! The tabletop book came in handy for maps. Overall it was an effortless trip! Thanks!
1246769,35334256,2015-06-17,2402726,Celia,The condo was comfortable and had an excellent location.  I thought the kitchen was well stocked to make meals if you wanted to cook but the neighborhood was full of restaurants so why bother.  Having a parking pass was a real plus.  We just parked our car on the street in front of the building and walked or took public transportation to everything.  No need to drive anywhere and then have a hassle with parking.  Overall it was a great experience.
1246769,35535351,2015-06-20,24500295,Zach,Hosts are very organized and apartment was clean and comfortable as advertised.  Also they were very quick and helpful in responding to our questions.  Great location as well with many downtown attractions within walking distance.
1246769,37134981,2015-07-05,28053377,Stephen,"Dirk and Jaq are experienced airbnb hosts and this came across in all communication making the whole process painless.  The apartment is brilliantly located being a stones throw from fabulous restaurants yet a short walk to the main shopping area, Pike Place Market and waterfront.  This is a perfect place for first time visitors to Seattle and the apartment has everything you could need. "
1246769,37735925,2015-07-10,30343233,Liz,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at Jaq and Dirks! It was convenient to the Pike Place Market which is a lot of fun! We got some delicious cheese and bread there. It's also fun to see them throw the fish. It's also near Capital Hill which can is a cool up and coming area that has live music. It's also not far from the space needle and the EMP Museum. We definitely recommend their place. The only challenge was finding a parking spot since its on street parking and there is construction going on which limits the amount of spots even more. Overall, a great experience! "
1246769,38366749,2015-07-15,26181536,Chris,Great stay!
1246769,38983704,2015-07-20,28979422,Chris,"Dirk and Jaq did an amazing job for our visit. They are so easy to deal with and reach. The condo was absolutely perfect and close to almost everything. Jaq was overly helpful with all of the details of the area, condo, things to do, maps, etc. (They went above and beyond) The condo was super clean, neat, easy to use. I would recommend this place to anyone who is coming to Seattle. Trust me, if I am coming back this is where I will stay! Thanks Dirk and Jaq!"
1246769,39727732,2015-07-26,2450875,Robert,The apartment was as described although I did not get to meet them. The location was fantastic and everything went well. Would stay again. 
1246769,40426106,2015-07-31,28207856,Toni,"This was our first experience with airbnb, so we don't have any previous experiences/expectations to compare this with. And- the day we arrived, we received notice of a death in the family, so we were not as outgoing as we might have been in meeting/ communicating with our hosts.
We received very detailed information prior to our arrival from the hosts.  It was extremely helpful.   In fact, we wish we had ignored google maps directions and just followed theirs!  We arrived prior to check in time, and were extremely grateful for a place to store our luggage for a few hours.
The accomodations were as stated online.  The rooms do look larger in  the photos, but the space was ample for us.  We only communicated via email and text during our stay, but received prompt response to questions that we had. 
Overall, this experience was positive, and left us eager to explore other airbnb accomodations in other parts of the country.   We hope we did what was expected of us as guests!"
1246769,40759233,2015-08-02,35970917,Reid,Great vacation spot.
1246769,41719500,2015-08-09,26378274,Ryan,"We met Dirk on the first day we arrived. He was very kind and informative about the nearby places and restaurants. We got a small tour of the apartment and came back to settle in after Dirk was done cleaning. The apartment is very clean and spacious. It has all the amenities you would need and even many of the things you will forget to pack. The location is extremely convenient as my girlfriend and I only walked or took public transportation. Overall, this was a great experience. Thanks to Dirk and Jaq once again for letting us use their home."
1246769,42263867,2015-08-12,4239333,A.M.,"The apartment is just as described. The location is perfect for exploring Capitol Hill and being close to the Convention Center. 

It was a very warm day, but the hosts had set up an a/c unit and a box fan to spread the cool air. Super thoughtful and wonderfully effective!

Communication was easy and quick - I really loved how fast they responded to emails. All the information you need about staying and checking out are very easy to find when you get there - with the wifi info included! 
"
1246769,42656911,2015-08-15,30170181,Jane,"Our stay was fantastic.  It has a great location--able to walk to many downtown sites and close to public transportation.  We used Light Rail from the airport and it was an easy walk from the Westlake station to the condo.   It is clean and bright and has many comforts of home.   Dirk and Jac provide all that hotels offer (coffee, shampoo, iron etc.) plus they also have a notebook full of information about the area such as maps, area restaurants, and grocery stores.  A great place to use as a base to enjoy all that Seattle has to offer."
1246769,43215565,2015-08-18,19453072,Dana,"Everything was perfect! Loved the location, we were able to walk to everything we wanted! Thanks! "
1246769,43624481,2015-08-21,34543799,Lynn,"Dirk and Jaq have an amazing place to offer!  It was very clean, very convenient to pikes place and just an all around great place to stay at a reasonable price in Seattle!  Make sure you try Tango (tapas restaurant, try the El Diablo dessert!!!!) And the Starbucks roastery which are a 5 minute walk away!  Thank you again!"
1246769,44091083,2015-08-24,14171273,Evgenia,"Had a great stay! Air conditioner was much appreciated during warm summer nights. Perfect location, 15 min walk to Pike place market. "
1246769,45234236,2015-09-01,26977344,Melissa,"This was a fantastic place to stay in Seattle - especially as we were attending a major event in the Convention Centre which was literally next door.  It was also close to everything else in the central city so we were able to walk to places like the Pike Place markets and the Space Needle.  Dirk and Jaq were perfect hosts and went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay - making it easy for us to arrive quite late, and allowing us to leave our bags for an extra few hours on our day of departure - both much appreciated!  We had 3 adults in our group and can recommend the sofa bed - it was by far the best we had in our 6 week holiday (the main bed was good too)."
1246769,45775667,2015-09-06,31976651,Melissa,The apartment is very nice and modern. Just what we were looking for. We were able to walk everywhere we needed. Very easy to find and get in and out. 
1246769,47038074,2015-09-15,35978884,Araceli,"This was our first time booking a place to stay through airbnb and it was the best! Surpassed my expectations! We personally did not get to meet them but they were helpful and more than accommodating our entire stay! Their place looks just like their photos--absolutely no surprises. We seriously had the best experience ever. If I'm ever back on Seattle, I will definitely be looking their place up! Felt right at home! "
1246769,47629083,2015-09-21,12070582,Laura,"Everything was as it was described. It was comfortable and the location was perfect for me. Close to everything, even the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve! There were plenty of linens and towels and the kitchen was also stocked. The bed was comfortable. I have no complaints.

"
1246769,48105552,2015-09-23,5167644,Chris,"Top notch location sandwiched in between Capitol Hill (hip area with great restaurants and bars) and Downtown (Home of Pike Place market and retail stores).

Apartment is great - clean, spacious, and comfortable. Towels are furnished among shampoo, soap, etc. Dropoff and pickup are seamless."
1246769,48377671,2015-09-26,33531716,Tien,"Great stay. Dirk and Jaq's place is nice and clean. Within walking distance of everything. Only thing is if you have a car, parking is extremely hard to find even with their parking permit. "
1246769,48990582,2015-09-30,36654764,Manny,Great stay in a clean and centrally located area. No troubles at all during my stay. Would recommend to family and friends. Quite area with many amenities close by. 
1246769,49628591,2015-10-05,30905300,Jason,"First and foremost, the location was absolutely perfect, within a mile or so from pretty much everywhere we wanted to be. The place was very clean, efficient, and functional. It was exactly as advertised. We would definitely recommend it and stay on a return visit to Seattle. Otherwise, Dirk and Jaq were very informative, very prepared, and kept good communication. Thanks, Dirk and Jaq! We had an incredible stay!"
1246769,50169211,2015-10-10,34185533,Dave,"Dik and Jac made it easy to navigate through our first Airbnb experience. They always respond quickly. We stayed here for the last three days of our vacation and it was great. They had everything we needed and then some. The location was great because we could walk or call Uber. It was very quiet and clean, clean, clean. It's in a secure building and everyone was friendly. I would recommend this to anyone who's wants to be close to all the activiites downtown. "
1246769,50675277,2015-10-13,44430377,Xueyin,"Everything is perfect, clean, warm, nice location, speedy reply ~~I will choose stay with them, who are very kind host~~thanks so much."
1246769,51272406,2015-10-19,25118771,Tim,"Prior to arrival, Dirk and Jaq provided very detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment, key pick up, etc. 

Apartment is the same as the pictures, very clean and the location is great. REALLY good location!!! Heart of downtown."
1246769,51895756,2015-10-25,8780149,Danielle,"The  check in process was very smooth, Drik & Jaq provided a ton of information beforehand. The entire stay was stress free!"
1246769,52846795,2015-11-02,30640257,Michael,Nice clean condo with everything I needed for a relaxing stay
1246769,54698672,2015-11-23,26652335,Jean,"We loved our stay in Seattle! Jaq was very easy to work with and always provided great information. There is a lot of great information on the city in the apartment, which was very helpful in deciding what to do once we arrived. 

The apartment is perfect for two people. The photos were spot on. They haven't crowded the apartment with a lot of furniture so it feels really spacious. The mattress was really comfortable and the shower was great! The space is light, modern and very European. We spent a lot of time in the apartment and were very comfortable the whole time.

The location is great too. It's close to everything. We were able to either walk everywhere or catch the monorail to the Space Needle which is just a short walk away.

If we come back to Seattle, we hope to be able to stay in the apartment again."
1246769,55186625,2015-11-29,30058447,Amy,I had a great experience staying here! The hosts were so helpful and easy to communicate with. The guidebook they left had some great suggestions and a very helpful explanation of the public transportation which we found very helpful. Loved it! 
1246769,55656138,2015-12-04,30714853,Annie,This was my first AirBnB experience and it was a great one!  Dirk & Jaq gave good detailed information about the place and the place was as described in the posting.  The bed was more comfortable than what I have at home!  I was attending a conference at the Washington Convention Centre and this apartment was a 5 minute walk to the centre!  Thanks Dirk & Jaq!
1246769,55907726,2015-12-07,10193709,Guy,"This is an excellent apt, very well situated for downtown Seattle and transfers in from the airport. Surprisingly quiet, too. It's clean and modern, very well-kept, and easy to use. Hosts super prompt and helpful."
1246769,56839108,2015-12-19,9151001,Piero,"- Great apartment in central location. 
- Easy self check in/check out. 
- Very clean.
- Tv and Internet worked well.
- Good communication."
6701018,35027434,2015-06-14,33930527,Erin,"This was a great apartment for my family. After staying in hotels, a relaxing place with a separate bedroom was exactly what we needed. It was located close to a nice park and the zoo, as well as the Phinny ave. farmers market on Friday which was great. And it was a quick drive down Aurora to get to the city center. Sonny was very accommodating with all of our needs. I'd definitely stay here again or recommend it to a friend. "
6701018,36460673,2015-06-28,36148689,Alleson,Sonny was very welcoming and ensured he walked me through the entire apartment prior to leaving it in my hands.  
6701018,36840248,2015-07-01,5603400,Eric,Sonny was an awesome host! Very friendly and easy to communicate with. The place was perfect for a few days stay and is close enough to downtown and all the things you would need. I would definitely recommend Staying here. 
6701018,37781729,2015-07-10,20163361,Kris,"Sonny communicated with us often prior to our arrival and he was very easy to contact and responsive to our needs. The apartment was comfortable and clean, well-stocked with cooking equipment, and we had access to laundry facilities. The location was very close to public transportation, including the express bus to downtown, which took about half an hour to get to Pike Place or the Space Needle. The neighborhood itself, Shoreline, was somewhat remote from good coffee, shopping, and restaurants. There is a great Asian market and a movie theater across the street, as well as a Starbucks and IHOP. The number 40 bus took us to Ballard, and the number 5 took us to Phinney Ridge, which are both great neighborhoods to visit. Sonny is a great host, and the apartment is a great deal for travelers who don't mind figuring out how to get around a city. "
6701018,38183842,2015-07-13,880056,Venus,Sonny was very friendly and very helpful. The place was clean and spacious. We will stay there again.
6701018,38913912,2015-07-19,37374255,Anita,The apartment was very clean and well-stocked (even bananas!). Sonny was very accommodating. This location was perfect for our purposes; close to the events we were attending. 
6701018,39233195,2015-07-21,13206062,Ann,Sonny was an excellent host-- very responsive and helpful. The apt was great. It has a fully stocked kitchen and is very private and quiet. Great place close to Green Lake and Fremont.
6701018,39453855,2015-07-23,13739843,Alec,"Sonny was a friendly and accommodating host. He lives on site which is always good and he gave us some recommendations on where to visit in the area. The property neighborhood leaves something to be desired, but the inside of the apt offered a comfortable recess. It's got good size for a 1 bedroom and is colorfully decorated. The kitchen looks out to the family area which is nice, and it made for a comfortable 2-night stay for us. All in all it was pleasant and suitable for our stay."
6701018,41791248,2015-08-09,35726532,Carlos,"Sonny made me feel very welcome and I always felt comfortable asking him any questions or concerns with the apartment or area. The description he wrote for the place was spot on! The neighborhood made you feel like you were a Seattle local and helped forget that you were in a new city. 

I would highly recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle to consider Sonny's apartment! I was very impressed with the sense of space in the rooms as well as how comfortable it was to sleep on the couch and blowup mattress. This is a great place for a great price that I would definitely use again if given the chance."
6701018,42178294,2015-08-11,11579467,Rachel,"Sonny was very good at proactively communicating what needed to happen to get into the apartment. There was a little snafu that the previous guest didn't check out until almost 1 PM, which delayed my check in. However, even with that problem Sonny was all over it, and my husband and I got in by 5 PM. 

Do be warned that there isn't any Air Conditioning in the unit. This was fine for the most part, but it was rather warm while we were visiting. There were no ceiling fans and only 2 smaller stand fans. 

The apartment is conveniently located next to a bus stop that has the ""E"" express line downtown. It only took about 20 minutes to get to Pike Place Market. Additionally, it's only a $6 uber to get to downtown Greenwood with tons of restaurants and bars. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this rental. It' the right price and conveniently located to many of Seattle's perks. "
6701018,42445925,2015-08-13,115624,Caren,"Sonny was friendly from the beginning and very helpful with everything! Good communication and very nice! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was a little bit dodgy for our taste, but it is definitely convenient to everywhere in Seattle. Sonny is a great host, thanks so much!"
6701018,43640034,2015-08-21,37718357,Jane,We arrived late in the evening and our host was there to greet us with keys and a quick tour of the unit.  Apartment is a basement (referred to as a ground level) unit in an older apartment building.  Hallway outside the unit smelled very musty and had old appliances sitting in the hall (refrigerator & dishwasher). Interior was clean.  The neighborhood is not safe to walk around during the day or evening.   There is a strip club located at the end of the street.  Four prostitutes were seen within three blocks of the apartment building during the day.  We had booked for seven nights but only stayed for two.  
6701018,44183115,2015-08-24,5775586,Faith (& George),"Sonny's apartment was super clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Even though our flight was 3 hours late, he couldn't have been nicer about staying up so he could show us in. The bus to downtown Seattle was just around the corner and we loved the shops and restaurants less than a mile away in the shopping district of Greenwood. We also enjoyed a short walk to a local park on a river for a morning trail run.

The apartment building is very close to a busy road, but when the windows are closed, it blocks out the noise entirely."
6701018,44429859,2015-08-26,14795623,Josh,"Sonny was an excellent host with outstanding communication.  We really enjoyed the apt, found it quiet and cozy after all day traveling/touring the city.  Can't comment on the neighborhood much since we spent all of our time downtown but it was super easy to get down to the city center from the apt.  "
6701018,45472061,2015-09-03,31546452,Deborah,"Sonny was a most excellent host for our stay in Seattle. The apartment was just what we needed. I was there with my 2 year old grandson, my daughter and her husband. We all agreed that we were happy we chose Sonny's place! At first we thought it might be ""a little too far out,"" but we were able to catch a bus, call an Uber, and even had a place to park our rental car for a couple of the days. Sonny was always available for any needs we had (with a 2 year old, we went through trash bags pretty quickly!).  Everything you need is in the apartment to cook…plus, there are plenty of places within walking distance to pick up food and bring back. With the exception of being near a fire station and the alarms that would go off, the place is very quiet and feels very secure and safe. I highly recommend Sonny's place…we would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Seattle!"
6701018,45834095,2015-09-06,34440142,Joel,"Sonny was a great host that was very attentive. The apartment was fantastic and had everything you needed. The apartment is a $20 dollar uber from downtown, and is located around the corner from the express bus stop. "
6701018,46559810,2015-09-11,626760,Daniel,"Though the location leaves a lot to be desired, the apartment is every bit as described and more. All of the trimmings are... economical, but every little thing that a roving nomad could want in an apartment is there. Soap, shampoo, clean towels, spices, oil, pots, pans, knives, and even a Chromecast(it wasn't working, but it's a great thought!). I think it might be the most comprehensively supplied place that I've rented in my travels around Seattle."

6701018,52961825,2015-11-03,16625050,Ingrid,"The neighborhood is definitely not a safe environment for families.  We saw homeless and drug abuse almost every day. We now live in another area of Seattle and we can say with knowledge Seattle is a friendly and safe city, just not around this property. We actually left the place 3 weeks before expected.  I don't think there's anything Family or Pets friendly about this place, sorry!"
6701018,54463049,2015-11-20,31800813,Kenique,"Sonny made us feel right at home the apartment was clean and cozy. Sonny was always available if we needed him, the apartment had everything. What I liked the most was that we were able to buy groceries and cook that was a big plus because we didn't have to go out a spend money on fast food everyday. "
6701018,56192858,2015-12-10,31936248,Nancy,"Due to a situation beyond his control, Sonny was unable to meet me however he made sure someone was able to check me in and give me an intro to the unit. The unit is spacious and well-equipped, clean and comfortable. Sonny was in contact during my stay and made sure I had everything I needed. Thanks Sonny!"
1277033,14174969,2014-06-13,1330435,Kaffka,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kelly's. The space was comfortable, very clean, and nicely appointed. We had great communication from our initial reservation request and throughout our stay.  The mini fridge and microwave were great conveniences, and the beverages and bottled water were so appreciated. The little touches were what really stood out and made our stay so welcoming and relaxing. We had plenty of privacy, but always felt right at home and secure in knowing our host was available to communicate if we had any need arise. We felt very welcomed and a little pampered.  The neighborhood is very diverse and has great offerings from fabulous coffee to organic groceries. Seward Park is a state treasure, and a great place to relax, hike, picnic, etc and close by to Kelly's house. I plan to stay here the next time I'm in Seattle. "
1277033,14215795,2014-06-14,16677320,Michelle,"We were desperately seeking a place to stay when our plans fell through at the last minute. Kelly responded quickly and worked it out for us to stay. The room is clean and quiet. Very large with really nice modern decor. Bed was super comfy and Kelly's attention to detail made us wish we were staying longer! It was our first Airbnb, but it won't be our last. Thanks!"
1277033,14412709,2014-06-18,1739857,MyungJu,"Kelly was a great host! I had a wonderful time staying with her. The room was very clean, large, and private. It was exactly as shown in the pictures and had everything I needed. Plus, the bed was super comfortable! Kelly was very friendly and went out of her way to make me feel so comfortable. Kelly also gave me a ride to the light rail station, which was very nice. I would definitely recommend!"
1277033,14499823,2014-06-20,8903875,Alexander,"This place was fantastic, it was late at night around 9pm and we needed a place to stay at last minute. Kelly was quick to reply and she took us in and even said she needed a few minutes to get the place cleaned up as well. It was extremely clean and cozy just like she described. I've only stayed at four AirBnB places all in Seattle and this by far is the best place I've been to. Good job and I highly recommend staying here, I'll definitely come back if I need to in the future!"
1277033,14646453,2014-06-23,16402214,Leah,"Kelly was great, set everything up for us and was available for any needs we had.  Seward Park 1/2 a mile away was a dream for our kids!  Comfy bed, and convenient to have the mini fridge and be in Seattle proper.  Thanks for a great stay!"
1277033,14885422,2014-06-28,9604667,David,"The room is really nice -- furnished with taste and care --, comfortable and private (there's a special entrance !). And very clean. There are a microwave and a small fridge in the room. 
Kelly really went to great lengths to make us feel at home, and we had an excellent stay !

As for the location : we had a car, but we also used the light rail during our stay. Using public transportation -- bus or light rail -- to get downtown is definitely doable with some walking. Both the city and the airport are very easily accessible with a car. 
The area is diverse and interesting -- we enjoyed walking around. The immediate surroundings are mostly residential, but there are actually a good number of coffeeshops and restaurants within 10-20min walking or a very quick drive. There's a nice list of recommendations in the room !"
1277033,15592333,2014-07-12,17077098,Nathalie,We absolutely loved our stay with Kelly! There was always a clear line of communication which was greatly appreciated. The home is easy to find and located in a nice/safe neighborhood. The setup was seamless and all the essentials were provided to us. Kelly went the extra mile and left a list of recommended things to do/places to eat that were located close by.  
1277033,16112491,2014-07-22,17015340,Daniel,"From the beginning, Kelly was extremely friendly and helpful during our 
communication. She was my first Airbnb host, and she answered all of my 
questions to help me through the process.

As for the stay itself, it was great! Getting to the location was easy 
with access to a car, although it would probably be difficult for those 
with only access to public transit since it is off the transit lines. It 
is in a suburb of Seattle near Seward Park, so we were only a few minutes 
from visiting either the beautiful Seward Park or downtown Seattle with a 
short drive. Within walking distance (less than 1 mile) there are some 
nice places to eat or grab coffee on Rainier Avenue.

Getting into the AirBNB was quick and painless. Free street parking was 
simple, and access to the AirBNB was done with an electronic door code. 
Once inside, everything was just as described- clean, eco-friendly, and 
comfortable. The room and private bathroom were both recently remodeled 
and I felt very comfortable during my stay.

My only complaint, and it is a very minor quibble and definitely causing 
hesitation to rate 5 stars, was that counter or shelf space is needed in 
the bathroom. I communicated this to Kelly and she said they were already 
planning on such an addition, so it's very likely my only complaint will 
have been addressed for future visitors."
1277033,16426094,2014-07-27,17829810,Bryson,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary and I have to say it is one of the best places we have stayed. The room was clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  Kelly was a great host and the room was just as private, if not more private, as a hotel would be. The separate and keyless entry were really nice. The room was very   cozy and made us feel very much at home. We would highly recommended Kelly's room to anyone who was visiting Seattle, the location was great, it took us about 15 minutes to get to the city. Just FYI the bathroom is across the hall from from the bedroom, whi ch wasn't a problem for us, but might be something to take into consideration."
1277033,16618348,2014-07-30,16947948,Anjelica,"We absolutely loved our stay with Kelly! She was quick in responding to any questions we had, and even welcomed us with cocktails when we arrived. The room was exactly what we expected and more. She even had a list of local places to eat and see around the neighborhood, which we used. The bed was sooo comfortable and we definitely utilized the sound machine. We only heard the baby a few times and didn't mind the morning shuffle in the morning. I loved all the eco-friendly products she had. It was nice not having a TV and enjoy the quiet a little bit. We are DEFINITELY going to stay here again if we go to Seattle again.

Thank you Kelly and Rhett!!

1277033,16991407,2014-08-05,17205480,Jarod,"Staying with Kelly was a pleasure, the room was fantastic and she was a great host"
1277033,17137547,2014-08-07,7340869,Erinn,"This was a great place to stay! Kelly was great. She responded really fast, which was great because we contacted her at 8pm the night before our stay. The room was clean and stocked with anything you could need. The neighborhood was also really cute. Just outside of downtown, a 6 minute Uber ride away! "
1277033,17376217,2014-08-11,18226710,Victoria,"My friend and I stayed with Kelly for a few days & we had a wonderful experience. The room was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to some yummy eats. The neighborhood is nice & not too far from downtown. 

Kelly was incredibly helpful and accommodating. This was my first time using Airbnb & she was kind enough to answer all of my questions. I would not hesitate staying here again. "
1277033,17591732,2014-08-14,17465562,Jennifer,"As I was new to Seattle the location was quite south of where I wanted to stay, but as we were there for two days and we had a full schedule, I decided that Kelly's place was fine.  I also appreciated that Kelly and airbnb were addressing the matter, in so far as a change in location.  IN the end it was more convenient to stay.

Other than meeting Rhett the evening we arrived, I had no other contact with the hosts in person.

I did find that having my own vehicle was necessary to get into the Seattle core, and I used MLK, Rainer and S Jackson to quickly get in and out as we toured around.

Geraldines Diner on Ranier, just a couple blocks away from Kelly and Rhett's was great for breakfast.  I recommend the Spinach Feta Omelette. 
"
1277033,17761891,2014-08-17,12873205,Kelly,Kelly and Rhett have a great space to offer! It was comfortable and welcoming.
1277033,18030719,2014-08-20,4996776,Sarah,"Great set-up, amazing hosts, excellent neighborhood.  Could not have been better."
1277033,18258596,2014-08-24,18691160,JoEllen,"Beautiful, clean room with a super comfy bed. Kelly was put of town at the beginning of our stay but Rhett and I were in contact about my flight being delayed and he left the walkway lights on for us. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. If you are visiting from out of the area, this was a short drive from the Seattle Tacoma airport and the amazing city itself. We drove all over Western Washington State and were happy to have Kelly and Rhett's house to come ""home"" to every night. If you're less adventurous than we are, you will love the room's microwave and fridge and table and chairs. Water in the shower was nice and hot with good pressure. I would recommend this airbnb to all. Thanks for a great stay!!"
1277033,18482316,2014-08-27,18296553,Chi,"Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience a great one.  We really enjoyed our stay.  My little one referred to it as home.  We'd stay here again.  Kelly was great!  She was easy to contact & talk to (prior to & during stay); is friendly but also gives you your space.  The sofa was already set up since an add'l sleeping area was need.  Children's books & toys were provided which was a very nice & welcomed gesture!  The space is as described; clean & comfortable.  There's ample room for lots of luggage w/o it getting in the way.  Despite the warm weather, the space stayed cool.  Easy to find location w/ample street parking.  There are a few hills but they're manageable via car.  Close to lots of eateries and parks.  Seward Park is great for kids (2 playground areas) and adults (walking/hiking trails).  "
1277033,19337198,2014-09-10,20528108,Melissa,"Kelly was a wonderful host. She responded quickly, gave recommendations and even provided us with a bassinet and rocking chair to use with our baby. The apartment was clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable. It was nice to have access to the washer and dryer as well. If you plan on using public transportation during your stay, I would recommend taking the 50 bus instead of the 7. It's an easier and better walking route, especially at night. Overall we had a great time!"
1277033,20153567,2014-09-24,20700041,Audrey,"Kelly and Rhett are wonderful, they really thought in everything when planning this place. It is a peaceful neighbourhood and after a busy day visiting the city, it was great to get back to this place and relax. The apartment is clean, comfortable and airy. Perfect! It was my first airbnb experience and could not be better!"
1277033,23451044,2014-12-01,9560926,Craig,"We had a great stay here.  The room is very large and the bed is really comfortable.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet.  The hosts were super attentive to all of our needs and went out of their way to help us in having a wonderful Thanksgiving visit with our daughter and son-in-law, who live nearby."
1277033,32074093,2015-05-13,6332018,Ana,"SPIC AND SPAN!!!  I had a really nice & easy stay in Kelly & Rhett's home.  The room is exactly how it looks in the photo and is SUPER clean & fresh.  The cork floor is very cool and YES!  the bed is very comfy.  The bathroom was also new & immaculate.  I picked this place because it was near to the friend's house I was visiting however, I ended up loving the neighborhood.  Seward Park has really cute homes and great views of the water and the park is fantastic.  It was very easy to check in & out and it felt very private even when this lovely little family was home.  They totally give you your space and you have your own entrance through the back yard.  Parking was a breeze and this property is a great jumping off point to other neighborhoods & downtown.  It's also very close to the light-rail if you don't have a car.  I would totally stay here again on my next visit to Seattle!"
1277033,33323016,2015-05-26,11029005,April,"My friend and I needed a clean safe place to sleep for our 2 nights in seattle and it was just perfect for that! Very spacious room. The private entrance was great because we were coming and going at some odd hours and i hate to disturb the people we are staying with. The bed was crazy comfortable and everything was spotless, great water pressure in the shower!

While we didn't actually meet Kelly or her husband she was in contact with us at time of check-in and gave us some suggestions via messaging. She made it very clear that if we needed anything to let her know! 

Just about a mile from the great strip of restaurants in columbia city. Kelly recommended lotties and it was delicious!"
1277033,34578142,2015-06-09,34407759,Marta,"The room is very nice, clean and comfy. Kelly takes care of her guests and leaves everything you might need in the room and the bathroom, plus some little healthy indulgences. She was also super helpful and patient with all my questions (I just moved to Seattle and had no clue about anything).
I stayed in her airbnb with my husband and daughter for over a week and everything was exactly like described. You can hear life and steps upstairs in the morning and in the evening, but you definitely have your privacy, this family is very respectful of that. In short, it was very positive experience. Recommended.

1277033,35249016,2015-06-16,18195031,Rhonda,"Had a wonderful stay here! The room was exactly as described. Like staying at a hotel. We had the privacy we needed, and the hosts were available and super-friendly. Location was so close to the lake; easy access to the freeway. Would definitely stay again. "
1277033,36422654,2015-06-28,19065392,Amaris,Kelly and her family were great hosts. She checked in often and was quick to respond to messages. Pictures and descriptions were accurate.  The room was a nice size. I liked that it had a private entrance.  And the washer and dryer were a lifesaver.   
1277033,38538812,2015-07-16,3140267,Xiaoke,"My wife and I spent three nights in this wonderful private room during our summer vacation in Seattle. The bedroom and bathroom are clean; the neighborhood is quiet; the location makes it easy to go to SEA airport and the piers. Kelly and Rhett are very helpful to make our stay comfortable, and give us a lot of privacy. Highly recommended!"
1277033,39654539,2015-07-25,18890327,Allyson,I loved my experience at Kelly's home! Incredibly clean and they even left me a few healthy snacks! The water pressure in the shower was fantastic and I really appreciated the keyless entrance.  The best part was the bed. The MOST COMFORTABLE BED I have ever slept in in my life! I would stay here again any day.
1277033,40147895,2015-07-28,35956164,Elizabeth,"Kelly and Rhett have provided a very comfortable room that is exactly as described.  As it is in a basement, you do hear footsteps and voices upstairs.  Unlike other airbnb experiences, however, it was very private!  I did not have any in-person interaction with the hosts and needed to call/message with any questions.  This would be a good place for people who are planning to do lots of sightseeing, but I missed having access to common living room space and the enjoyment of getting to know my hosts."
1277033,40524250,2015-07-31,36093036,Julie,"The description and pictures are exactly what you will expect even the noises coming from their children! Very friendly hosts that respects your privacy! We didn't have the opportunity to meet Kelly but we meet Rhett! He was very welcoming and gave us some recommendations and tips on where to go in the city! When staying in this room you'll be expecting a very quiet, peaceful neighborhood!!! Room is close to Colombia City! The hosts, though you might not be able to see them they take care of you! They left us snacks, water, a guidebook, and some necessities like sun block, hair dryer, games etc. Regardless, they were definitely friendly!! We hope in the future when staying in Seattle to stay here with them again, and hope everyone else who stays with them also have this amazing experience as we did!!"

The description online was accurate, the room was stylish and comfortable, the snacks a treat and there was great pressure in the shower. Kelly was an incredibly accommodating host during our stay. We'd highly recommend her as a host."
2715623,13693347,2014-06-02,13977256,Susan,"Our host, Debera, was most gracious and kind.  She made us feel at home right away.  We appreciated  so much the craftsmanship of her cottage: the lovely fireplace, the scintilating small tiles over the kitchen sink, the claw foot tub, the granite-tiled shower, the perfectly comfortable bed, the modern kitchen.  It is all of a piece.
We went for many walks in the wonderful Queen Anne neighborhood, and truly hated to leave Le Bijou.
But we hope to come back next year.

Thank you, Debera.

Susan and Bob"
2715623,16200013,2014-07-23,14339924,Colin,Host was very gracious and strived to make the experience as delightful as possible. House was beautiful and in a very convenient location for getting to KeyArena / downtown.
2715623,17849667,2014-08-18,3312655,Megan,"I rented this space for my sister and her children who were coming to visit Seattle for my wedding. I want to make it clear that I personally didn't stay there so all the information in this review is what I heard first hand from my sister who did. Debera was very helpful with the booking but once my sister got there (after checking in and staying a night) she was then told that children were not allowed. This was NOT stated on the airbnb page when I rented it and I did say it was my sister and her family who were coming to stay. Needless to say, receiving a call from my sister very upset and worrying they were going to be kicked out 30 minutes before our rehearsal dinner was not ideal .  This entire situation caused me a lot of stress during my wedding weekend. "
2715623,18402174,2014-08-26,6447538,Vinit,"We had a wonderful time at Le Bijou of Queen Anne. Debera, the host, is delightful, friendly, and very welcoming. The cottage is more beautiful than the listing and the photographs suggest. It's very comfortable, with great natural light. The neighborhood is perfect. We stayed without a car. We used a Zipcar a couple of times, used public transit a few times, and walked a lot. We would enthusiastically recommend the place to our friends, and come back without hesitation! "
2715623,31490185,2015-05-05,19563976,Rio,"My mother and I stayed at le Bijou for a weekend and we absolutely loved our stay. Debera is the sweetest and most welcoming woman and she has created such a beautiful and comfortable home to stay in. Le Bijou is the guest house to her main house so you have complete privacy in the back of the property. She was very helpful and made sure we were always comfortable. I would definitely recommend for anyone to stay here, it's perfect. "
2715623,37253526,2015-07-05,37089108,Tom,perfectly wonderful experience!

Your cottage is exactly as advertised - DARLING!  Super clean, very user-friendly and the location is amazing!  It's obvious that all the renovation you did to restore this little gem was truly a 'labor of love""!  Your advice to explore the Queen Anne area was spot on; the historic stairway views, Thursday's Farmers Market and the neighborhood eateries were wonderfully eclectic!  Thanks for a great stay!!

3818746,25500978,2015-01-18,17555132,Jaime,Beautiful home. Stunning views and comfy beds. Really enjoyed the morning sunrise with a cup of coffee and the fireplace going. So relaxing. We really enjoyed the open layout of living area and kitchen. We cooked all of our meals at the home and it was nice to still visit and cook at the same time without feeling excluded in a kitchen. I plan on making a lot of trips to Seattle now that I have a niece on the way and I hope the house is available every trip.  Wonderful trip wonderful memories. Thank you.

The kitchen/main floor layout was absolutely ideal for the weekend. With 6 people we were all able to mingle while folks were cooking away. 

Laura was a fantastic host. 10/10 would rent again."

We couldn't have been more pleased!  
3818746,31909260,2015-05-11,30696171,Ulla,"My in-laws stayed in Laura's house recently. Laura was a very well organized and professional host. The house is absolutely amazing, the views are unbeatable and all finishings are of high quality. The house was spotless clean and just as described. It was easy to check-in and check-out. The location of the house is fantastic, it could not have been better. My in-laws enjoyed their stay very much, I would recommend this rental at any time it is absolutely worth it! "

3818746,45976359,2015-09-07,6694643,Ferran,"Alki Beach View Home has been an impeccable experience. Laura was very sweet and attentive, and the apartment is just amazing: It is a fully equipped, spacious place, it is very well located to explore Seattle as well, and it has gorgeous views from its cool deck. I would also highlight how clean everything is in this house. Beyond doubt, one of my best (likely the best) picks on Airbnb so far. Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!"
3818746,46871404,2015-09-14,21613207,Sarah,"Perhaps the most beautiful airbnb home we have ever rented. The views from the balcony are amazing, the cozy blankets are a nice touch. The kitchen is well equipped. The bedrooms are large with comfy beds and spectacular views. Would unreservedly recommend this house."
3818746,47664436,2015-09-21,38690482,Annie,"The Alki beach view home was wonderful! 

We recently stayed at the beach view home with a small group of college friends, and we all loved our time there. The views of the water were gorgeous from every room, the kitchen was well-stocked, the living room area was comfy (great place to lounge around with wine and appetizers), the towels were really soft, we just can't say enough nice things about this place. Laura was an incredibly gracious and kind host. Thank you, Laura! We'll recommend this place to anyone."

2203983,10275697,2014-02-10,11674878,Sara,"This is a perfect private space for your Seattle visit-- a spacious, stand-alone guest house with thoughtful design and amenities for visitors:  a comfy bed with plenty of extra blankets, a nice couch, a useful kitchenette and table, and a very well-done bathroom.  There's lots of good lighting, two great window/light sources with excellent privacy shades, and great central heat that you can control for yourself.  

It's a 10-minute walk to the Columbia City station of the Light Rail, but you're staying in a real, local neighborhood.

Your hosts are incredibly kind, friendly ""book people""-- a terrific and fun eclectic shelf of books in your cottage that are yours for the ""borrowing.""  You have a separate back-entrance to the cottage, so you have your autonomy, but your hosts are exceptionally generous and ""neighborly"" without being at all invasive.

I recommend this place to everyone!!"
2203983,10438734,2014-02-18,11217528,Karen,"This is a cute place!  Husband and I stayed here Valentine's Day weekend (2014), which was also the weekend of my birthday.  We loved it here and felt very comfortable.  

Jason and his family were unable to be there when we stayed, but he made all arrangements for us prior to, and communicated everything we needed to know.  

What we loved best was being able to have our breakfasts and dinners in and not need to spend extra money eating out.  And, we were able to put a dvd in the machine one evening and relax.  I would highly recommend Columbia City Cottage and would definitely stay here again."
2203983,10802715,2014-03-08,12453005,William,This studio cottage was just as advertized. It was charming and the hosts were friendly and helpful. We would stay again and encourage you to as well.
2203983,11244360,2014-03-26,12165312,Chelsea,"Our stay in this studio cottage was great! We did not get a chance to meet Jason, but that was only because we were out and about nearly the entire time we visited Seattle. His lovely wife and daughter introduced themselves on the first day though, and they were very sweet! We had everything we could need, and the cottage was as advertised. 

Jason was great with communicating to me everything I needed to know for our stay. And there were a few extras, such as cold drinks in the fridge and a place to park our rental car, that really made our stay relaxing and enjoyable. AND we enjoyed the neighborhood as well... Safeway grocery store just a block away, Starbucks a few blocks down (of course. It's Seattle!), gas stations, food... whatever you need, it's nearby."
2203983,13071696,2014-05-19,9235906,Natasha,"I rented the Columbia City Cottage for my parents while they visited me and my family nearby.  Jason was very welcoming to them and his family were kind and helpful hosts.  The cottage was large, comfortable and very clean.  The kitchen was well equipped and there were lots of books to read, tv, and a comfortable couch. My parents also really enjoyed walking from the cottage to the bakery in Columbia City to buy croissants, and then to our house.  It was a sweet find and I'm glad it met their needs.
  "
2203983,13569902,2014-05-31,1615059,Sarah,I booked the cottage for my aunt and uncle who were visiting from Australia as I couldn't accommodate them at my place near by. They had an absolutely great stay and Jason and Leslie were wonderful hosts. Will definitely be recommending this spot to future visitors!
2203983,13954446,2014-06-09,13887051,Adam Bradley,"The room was adequate, and a very affordable price.The hosts gave us lots of privacy."
2203983,14226443,2014-06-15,14141355,Scott,"This was our first stop on our honeymoon, and we couldn't have been happier. Great little neighborhood, residential feel, but with tons of great restaurants and whatnot within walking distance (say 1 mile). Easy access to public transit (light rail was about a mile, didn't much mess around with buses). House itself was perfect. Private, spacious enough to relax in, and a nice outdoor space. Would highly recommend."
2203983,16604540,2014-07-30,5651472,Mike,"nice place, bigger than expected and had all the amenities one would want.  not far of a walk to the lrt, there's some good restaurants in this area as well.  Good host (Jason), they're putting in a hot tub soon too!  Although it was much too hot to be enjoyable while we were there.

All in all would definitely stay again"
2203983,19602496,2014-09-15,18817631,Carol,"A really lovely stay in a quaint and cozy place. Jason met us at the door and was patient and kind while we got settled. We felt very taken care of but also completely independent--he didn't hover but he was there when we needed him, always just a text away, in the best host style. We needed an ironing board at one point and he just came right over, no questions asked. The room was comfortable and clean and exactly what we were looking for. Can't wait to come back!"
2203983,19896915,2014-09-20,2059054,Vena,"What a great spot! We took full advantage of the space, bbqing and using the hot tub. Jason was friendly, flexible and easy going. Perfect for our small family. I wish we could stay here every time we come to town!"
2203983,20190493,2014-09-25,19928913,Miguel,"This was my wife and I's first airbnb experience and it lived up all of our expectations. We are considering moving to Seattle and wanted to experience living ""like locals"" and this was the ideal set up. Jason came out to meet us when we first arrived to the cottage. He made both of us feel very welcomed and offered to help us anyway he could while we were in town. I was looking for an iron in the cottage so I sent Jason a text, and he responded right away and got it to us in no time! 

The cottage is as advertised and much larger than I expected. The space has everything one would need to enjoy a stay in beautiful Seattle from a kitchen with appliances, tv and super warm showers. There is even parking right next to the cottage which makes it feel like its your very own apartment. We even had breakfast and lunch on the front porch a couple times which was very relaxing a peaceful. 

The neighborhood is very cool and has quite a bit to offer if you wanted to just hang out in the area. Seward Park is a short drive (5-7 mins), really great restaurants/coffee shops and even nightly live music at the Royal Room! 
This part of the city offers easy access to the Great Seattle area and also the airport since its both not too far South but also North enough to get into Downtown very quickly. 

If we need to come back and scope out out places to live next year, we will definitely be staying here again. Thanks Jason!

2203983,20560875,2014-10-01,20235966,Jane,"Everything was clean and neatly presented.  All amenities were available, including a hot tub to add to the experience. We were on the go most of our stay.  We were able to prepare a quick breakfast and out the door to see the area.  So this worked perfectly for us, as it was conveniently located near our children and transportation."
2203983,21131689,2014-10-12,20236232,Danielle,Charming cottage with a parking spot which is great in Seattle. Host was nice. He came down to say hi even though it was later in the evening when we arrived. Clean comfortable place to stay.
2203983,21740808,2014-10-23,19893145,Karen,My husband and I were in Seattle to visit family. We spent our days at my daughter's house and came back to Columbia City Cottage to sleep each night. The bed was very comfortable and the house was a nice place to relax and then get ready for the day. Would definitely stay there again.
2203983,23110174,2014-11-23,20820759,Arlene,Jason checked in with me before my arrival and offered to pull out the extra sofa bed for us since we had a late-night arrival. The place is spacious with everything we needed like a microwave and pots and pans. We liked the modern design with nice artwork and a good selection of books on the bookshelf. The place also had heating and enough blankets to stay warm. Jason even told us not to worry about all the clean-up details because we had a very early departure and were rushed for time. It's a place nice enough to live in. I'll stay there again if I'm back in the area. Thanks for a great stay!
2203983,23794593,2014-12-10,23943060,Matt,"I recently stayed at the cottage for two nights; it matched the listing precisely and is an excellent value for the cute, lively Columbia City area. Jason was very easy to get ahold of and accommodating of my early arrival. Highly recommended!"
2203983,25817810,2015-01-26,946280,Dan & Renee,"We very much enjoyed this quaint little cottage in Columbia City.  The hot tub, just outside the front door, was a welcome destination at the end of the day after much walking.  We were visiting family in town, and they kept us busy.  So busy in fact, that we did not have the pleasure of meeting our hosts - up before the crack of dawn, and back very late in the evening.  We'll just have to wait until our next trip to meet them.

Great location and amenities - highly recommended for those that need a place to lay their heads when passing through Columbia City.

Dan & Renee"
2203983,26353224,2015-02-10,12453005,William,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable little cottage. It is exactly as described online (and more.)
Hosts are friendly, but not intrusive. The space is comfortable and (this is important in a Northwest winter) dry and warm. (There are built-in heaters at both ends of the cottage with a very responsive thermostat.
We will certainly stay there again if it's available."
2203983,26735898,2015-02-18,25191299,Gerald,"Jason was an excellent host.  Although we arrived late, arrangements for getting in were made and follow up texts were sent to verify that everything went well.  

The place was as described,  in a quiet neighborhood about 10-15 minute walk from the light rail station and very comfortable.

We would stay here again if we came back to Seattle."
2203983,27185607,2015-02-27,6426992,Michael,"Jason was efficient with the arrangements and was there when I checked in.  I have lived in this neighborhood before and know it.  It is safe and convenient to public transportation.   Place was clean and pleasant, no complaints.  Very nice, I would stay here again."
2203983,28796452,2015-03-30,26322293,Katie,Jason was extremely flexible through the booking process and made a stay in Seattle for a work trip very welcoming.  He is quick to answer questions and provide information about the location of his home in relation to other places in Seattle that we needed to be.  The off-street parking was a big benefit.  The home itself was comfortable and we look forward to staying there in the near future!  
2203983,29265046,2015-04-06,351402,Zach,"We had a lovely time in Seattle staying at the cottage. The amenities are exactly as described in the description. Very clean and felt 'at home'. Jason was even kind enough to swing by and pick us up from the train, as it was rainy and dark when we arrived. The train station is about a 10 min or so walk away. We used it everyday to get into town. It is clean and frequent. Food in columbia city was good, also a short walk away. I'd recommend this listing to anyone. If we come back to Seattle, we will try to come back to the cottage. "
2203983,30458130,2015-04-22,7408997,Amy,"We had a great time in the Columbia City Cottage. The neighborhood is fantastic, with Lake Washington and downtown Columbia City both just a few minutes away. Jason and Leslie are great hosts. Giving us our privacy but also very willing to chat or point us in the right direction for what we needed while in town. "
2203983,32684452,2015-05-20,29334850,Harold,"We did not meet Jason as we were in and out a  lot.  The house was small, but clean and pretty much as listed.  We were comfortable."
2203983,33087954,2015-05-25,11077274,Judy,"Jason has a little gem here.  The parking space is very near to the cottage. The porch and patio have comfortable seating.  The indoor space is roomy...about 24' by 24'.  The bed was one of the best of all the bnb's we have stayed in,  as was the shower and the lay-out of the bathroom.  Everything that we wanted was  available in the kitchen and the cottage.  A great wardrobe to put our clothes away also was helpful.  Very private space.  A great value."
2203983,35917252,2015-06-23,30647607,Lloyd And Lisa,"Jason made us feel very welcome at the Columbia City cottage.  The book in the cottage outlining the procedures was very helpful with information about the neighbourhood and peculiarities and procedures for the cottage.  
The house was very accessible to the neighbourhood and downtown Seattle.  Public transit was very close by as well as access to the highway.  
The cottage was fully outfitted for cooking which made it easy to prepare meals.  The crock pot was a huge asset which we used a couple of times during the week we stayed.
Overall we were extremely pleased with the cottage, its location, our hosts and our visit to Seattle and the US Open."
2203983,45326771,2015-09-01,26322293,Katie,"This is the second time that we have stayed at Jason's place and will continue to do so each time we come to Seattle as long as it is available!  The accommodations are clean, homey and very comfortable.  Jason is easy to work with and quickly answered any questions that I had.  Highly recommend!"
2203983,55835680,2015-12-06,1799338,Spencer,Very convenient to Columbia City and easy check in.  Would recommend. 
5580773,33146788,2015-05-25,6514259,Seth,"Nilda let us know we'd be greeted by her renter living in the unit above. It was easy to get in touch with both of them. Nilda left the  the door key and an informative note describing the unit. The apartment is perfectly located in Beacon Hill near the light rail station, which makes travelling into downtown Seattle easy. The two bedroom unit was personal, clean, and cozy. The deck sits high on the property overlooking a beautiful garden-a great place to relax. Nilda was very responsive and helpful in all of our text message contact. Thanks for a great trip to Seattle! "
5580773,34545897,2015-06-09,9639379,Abhishek,"We had a great time in Seattle. Nilda's place was conveniently located. Check in was easy even when we arrived at Nilda's place around mid night. We had a rental car so parking was a breeze. Beautiful views of the valley and rocky mountains from the backyard. Cozy and comfortable place to 3 to 4 people. It does require keeping the windows open when the temperature is a bit higher to keep the ventilation going but it works well and good sleep after windows are opened,"
5580773,40217074,2015-07-29,34367945,David,Wonderful welcome and stay. 
5580773,42699265,2015-08-15,7269314,Clément,"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Nilda mais elle a tout fait pour que notre arrivée soit facile ! Nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce quartier tranquille et très accessible à Beacon Hill, très facile de se déplacer dans le centre de Portland, à 3 minutes de la station de Link Light Rail). L'appartement est superbe, décoré avec soin et caractère, très propre et spacieux. Gros bonus pour le jardin et la très belle terrasse avec vue (ils ne figurent pas sur les photos). Cuisine spacieuse et salon cosy, en bref c'était parfait, merci Nilda !"
5580773,45372127,2015-09-02,7921427,Daniel,Everything was great with Nilda.  She welcomed us and even though we were very early for our check-in she had the place ready quickly.  She even told us where a great coffee shop was so we could wait.   Left our bags with Nilda.  The house was exactly as advertised.  Great internet service/wifi speed.  Nice neighborhood with a lot of stuff walking distance and VERY close to the train.
5580773,50795143,2015-10-14,37130334,Melanie,"Nilda's apartment is lovely and we felt at home right away. Also, Uber works perfectly in Seattle and I usually paid about 10 $ to go to downtown. Sorry for scaring you with the door again!"
5580773,53038654,2015-11-03,47139078,Anyssa,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5580773,55207985,2015-11-29,26269832,Danielle,"We really enjoyed our stay at Nilda's. The apartment was clean, comfortable with a lot of character.  It was also the perfect location for us! We would happily stay there again!"
1623894,11235870,2014-03-25,13320497,Ron,"Lisa and her family we outstanding hosts!   The location was great as well, we were close to pretty much everything in the Seattle area.  The home itself was very clean and well taken care and was stocked with pretty much anything and everything you might need for your stay!  It made our first experience with Airbnb a great one.  I would highly recommend Lisa and her family as your next host in Seattle.  I know me and my family will be giving them a call on our next visit!!"
1623894,11339076,2014-03-30,13497589,Yasmin,"We had a lovely time in this spotless, energy-efficient two-story cottage.  The bamboo floors are gorgeous, there is great separation of space, the bathroom is top notch, there is a nice sized closet, and the upstairs bed is very comfortable (the kids slept very well on the futon downstairs).  Fantastic location also - great restaurants & coffee around the corner and an easy, quick drive to downtown Seattle.  Even though Lisa was traveling, she was always available and is a charming and helpful host.  We will most definitely stay here again!  "
1623894,11689459,2014-04-12,6328149,Jo,"The house was perfect - warm, quiet, clean and comfortable. There's everything you could need to feel like you're at home - a well stocked kitchen (including pans, blenders, coffee machine, grater, microwave, toaster etc); washer and dryer; TV with inputs for USB and DVD; a sound system with auxiliary cable to hook up your own iPod; hanging space; comfortable beds; full blinds so you can sleep in, you name it! The small things make travel so much easier - providing shampoo and conditioner in the shower, oils and condiments in the pantry, and washing powder in the laundry.
When we arrived the hosts had snacks and necessities ready for us - a delicious loaf of bread, local beers, tea, coffee, eggs, yoghurt, milk, even guacamole.
The hosts - Lisa, Sean and Fin - were incredibly welcoming, friendly and generous. They would be there to chat, share a drink and tell us about Seattle if we wanted, but otherwise gave us complete privacy. They'd give us a lift down the street if they saw us walking along.
The area Ballard is great - delicious food, coffee and groceries are all very close. The part of Ballard the house is in is quiet, with beautiful flowers in the Spring time. However the bus (only a 4 minute walk away) takes you straight to downtown and the Pike Place Market area. Ballard ""proper"" is a 20 minute walk downhill, which has an incredible choice of hip bars, eateries, music venues, vintage stores, record stores and artisan fashion stores.
We stayed at week at the Ballard Backyard Cottage and were extremely sad to leave, and hope to stay in contact with the great hosts in the future."
1623894,12073261,2014-04-22,11028907,Lisa,"The cottage was super clean, efficient and well set up. Like the other reviews, just about anything you might need is supplied (hair dryer!). Lisa and her family are excellent hosts, conscientious and very classy. We really appreciated the ""eco-ness"" of the cottage and learned a few things ourselves! The beds & sheets are comfy, the neighborhood is peaceful and the few noises very soothing. We slept very well. The location is central to just about anywhere you want to go, and grounding to come back to. The cottage would make a perfect artist studio/getaway as well, hint hint!

Both my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend this place. : )"
1623894,12306708,2014-04-28,2639381,Drew And Sarah,"This was a charming, spotlessly clean, quiet, and aesthetic little cottage with everything we needed for our week-long stay.  Lisa and her family were welcoming with flowers and even some goodies.  One of the nicest places I've stayed in through Airbnb.  We look forward to coming back again some day!   "
1623894,12412170,2014-05-01,9523358,Mary Anne,"What a delightful, inventive, wonderful backyard cottage.  Very clever use of space that somehow manages to provide every single thing you would need, including wifi and washer and dryer, and even fresh coffee.  Our hosts, Lisa and Sean, were at the ready to help or respond to questions, and we had a terrific time.  The cottage is located in a beautiful neighborhood of Ballard, and we hope  to return many times.  Thank you Lisa and Sean for your kind hospitality and for sharing this lovely cottage. "
1623894,12590901,2014-05-05,2707838,Braley,Lisa was a great host and the voyage was the most amazing place. It was great for me and two of my friends. There's a comfy upstairs bed and a comfy futon downstairs. Lisa and her husband were very welcoming. And have us a few tips on where to go. Wish we would have had more time to sit and chat. great location! several cool bars to walk. And a short drive (or uber/lyft) ride to main Ballard area. Not far from down town either. It was also super easy to check in Lisa made sure we had all the info we needed to get into the cottage after our 13 hr drive to Seattle. I would stay there again if I come into town. Thanks!
1623894,13148109,2014-05-20,1212520,Jeremy And Rachael,"Lisa and Shawn were wonderful hosts, and their cottage was perfect for the two of us!  Clean, comfortable, and very well appointed with everything we needed for our weekend stay. And the location in Ballard is perfect!  The cottage is within easy walking distance to several of the fantastic restaurants in Ballard.

Highly recommended!!
"
1623894,13256250,2014-05-23,15392653,Ashvin,"we absolutely loved the design of the house, the great usage of space. it was clean upon rental, quiet neighbourhood, easy access to bus route to downtown seattle, basic groceries nearby. good water heater.
perhaps an iron would be useful. wonder if it is around there somewhere but we couldnt find it. otherwise, we are looking into booking this wonderful home again next year if we were to visit seattle again. take care!
oh another thing, this house is so environmental friendly! from their shampoos to their towels even their car. if many of us practiced this, our world would be a healthier place! note to my country, malaysia."
1623894,13401035,2014-05-27,11396820,Bruce,"Lisa was just great.  Very responsive to our questions and we spend a nice half hour chat upon our departure.  The cottage was perfect for our needs too.  Very clean, modern and perfect for the two of us.  We will be back!"
1623894,13506982,2014-05-29,647444,Brittany,"Loved this spot, wish we could have stayed all summer! Very welcoming and comfortable, great location near lots of shops and restaurants, and only a short ride to DT, Capitol Hill, etc. Lisa and her husband were very friendly when we arrived and we especially loved the outdoor area, adorable cat included. Would definitely stay again! "
1623894,13594167,2014-05-31,1212520,Jeremy And Rachael,"Our 2nd stay, and it was fantastic!  

This cottage is super clean, quiet, comfortable, and Lisa and Shawn are wonderful hosts.  From freshly roasted local coffee and a French press, local/organic soaps/lotions/shampoos and more, this little cottage has everything we need.

Highly, highly recommended and thankful for how close this cottage is to Ballard.  Thanks guys!! "
1623894,13669324,2014-06-02,7444817,Brian,"This was our family's first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have gone better. 

The cottage is exactly as pictured/described, which is to say, it's clean, modern, quiet, and in an AWESOME neighborhood. (We were just minutes from great restaurants, coffee, the Sunday Farmers Market, and parks, like the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks.)  

Adding to the experience, our host Lisa, had us feeling like old friends, and was happy to chat, and gave us plenty of privacy as well. She had several suggestions for places to eat, etc., close to cottage (tip: don't miss the Fat Hen nearby). 

Highly recommended for anyone exploring Seattle and the Ballard neighborhood. Will definitely return again. "
1623894,13962302,2014-06-09,2874015,Charlie,"The cottage was fantastic! It had everything we needed to make small meals in the kitchen, and it was quite clean. We would definitely stay here again. We didn't have a chance to meet Lisa, but she was very responsive and friendly over email. The neighborhood is nice as well. Highly recommended."
1623894,14475134,2014-06-20,2001292,Miriam,"This cottage is fantastic! It is a great location, nestled in a lively and accessible neighborhood. The cottage itself was immaculate -- super clean, great furnishings and every detail neatly accounted for. Lisa was quick to respond and very helpful in communications before booking, in the days leading up to our stay, and while we were there. We only stayed two nights, but this would be a very comfortable set up for a much longer stay. By far the nicest airbnb place I've seen and I'll definitely stay there again if I head back to Seattle!"
1623894,14685329,2014-06-24,14152977,Jenny,The hosts were very kind and gave excellent information about amenities in the neighborhood. The cottage was very clean and practically brand new (only about 5 years old). Perfect for a single person (downstairs on the futon) and a couple upstairs or a family. I really enjoyed relaxing on the shared deck. There are restaurants and an upscale market with wine/coffee close by. It's a very quiet neighborhood as well. I loved it! Enjoy!
1623894,14863845,2014-06-28,12406254,Kate And Joe,"Lisa was an excellent host, the cottage was cozy and well-appointed with all modern conveniences. The neighborhood is quiet, lovely homes and gardens, especially Lisa's. The deck/outdoor seating area are a plus, and never had a problem with on-street parking. We enjoyed our stay immensely. 

Ballard is a lovely village with great architecture and, although it's not exactly within walking distance, it's nearby with ample parking. We ended up spending more time strolling around there than in the city. Great shops for all tastes, a nice buzz and very friendly shop/gallery people and locals. 

The People's Pub was fun and very inexpensive, food and pitchers hit the spot. The ""Rajun Cajun"" sandwich at the Other Coast restaurant was to die for (I never use that phrase), and Café Besalu is a must. Cupcake Royale has lovely staff with $2 ice cream cones (homemade, fantastic, tasting encouraged) on Tuesdays. Clover has a very broad and interesting stock of toys. Kids sorted with those two stops.

Seattle is a quick bus trip for $2.50, and the #28 is a quick walk from the cottage. It took us to downtown tourist activities, and the #40 bus returned us to the center of Ballard. Don't miss the Locks and the Fish Ladder, we watched salmon, seals and herons for hours. So much more, but you can do your own research and have fun. We'll be back!"
1623894,14975976,2014-06-30,12675519,Max,"Truly a top-notch Airbnb experience. Hosts were friendly, chill, and generous with neighborhood and city recommendations. Cottage is new, clean, charming, cozy, and very functional despite being a relatively small space. Check-in and check-out were super easy and the neighborhood is a great place to make a home base provided you have a rental car. There is great walkable stuff as well - microbreweries, coffee, restaurants, bakeries. Highly recommended!"
1623894,15931962,2014-07-18,15098912,Likah,Lisa and Sean were amazing!  The backyard cottage was exactly as they had described.  Great neighborhood with easy access to public transportation.  
1623894,16005691,2014-07-20,14350043,Evelyne,"The Ballard Backyard Cottage is a fantastic little house in a residential area. We loved the two levels which give you more space and privacy if you travel with friends or kids. A very well equipped kitchen, an amazing bathroom - with plenty of towels and a nice assortment of care products - makes you feel at home! Everything is super clean. We also loved the wooden terrace where you can take your meals or relax. 
Lisa and the whole family are extremely nice people. the communication was very easy and efficient. We got the information we needed at the right moment. Lisa also put some very nice coffee and chocolate for us on arrival and we found all the basics in the fridge. 
It is definitely an excellent choice in Seattle and we can warmly recommend it to anybody!"
1623894,16112231,2014-07-22,3231102,Dave,"Lisa was easy to communicate with, and very prompt with her responses.  The cottage is located in a great part of Ballard - very quiet residential area, and a short walking distance to many local destinations - Old Ballard, restaurants, breweries/taprooms.  The cottage is in excellent condition and had more than enough amenities for our 2-day stay. I would absolutely recommend the cottage for anyone staying in Ballard."
1623894,16654395,2014-07-31,13756736,Farra,"Our hosts were gracious and helpful in orienting us to the bus system and our first airbnb experience, making it a delightful one indeed.  The neighborhood is great.  There was even an indoor swimming pool available nearby.  The little house is great and made for a ""home away from home"".  The space, tho small was ample for the two of us, very clean and Lisa had stocked the frig with our favorite breakfast items.  So we could leisurely get up, have great coffee (provided) and eat.  The outdoors area was real nice as well.  Lisa and Sean were terrific hosts as they always made us feel comfortable and their son Finn is adorable.  Marion and I loved it and would revisit again. "
1623894,16892662,2014-08-04,14449109,Pouran,We loved your cottage. It was just perfect for us. Thank you so much for all the breakfast items and other goodies you left us. We had a great time and look forward to staying at your cottage again. 
1623894,17050920,2014-08-06,16932764,Steven,"Wow!  Lisa and her family were gracious, helpful, and delightful hosts.  She provided quick follow up during the reservation process and offered assistance during our stay without every being obtrusive.  Terrific personal exchanges.

My family of four loved the cottage.  We were impressed by its clever design to make maximum use of a small footprint while providing every needed amenity.  It was like a Danish Modern ship.  The cottage provides a well equipped kitchen, a beautiful bathroom with a terrific shower (great towels, washcloths, soaps, shampoo and conditioner provided) , a washer and dryer, a well executed desk area with WiFi, two comfortable full sized beds, and comfortable living area (with wall mounted TV/entertainment) with well stocked DVDs for all ages.

We loved the Ballard neighborhood.  The immediate neighborhood is a lovely residential area, with restaurants and cafes blocks away.  We found it a convenient location to get to all of our destinations in the Seattle area.  One night we had take-out from a wonderful neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant and ate it outside at the patio dining table and chairs.

We look forward to returning to the Ballard Backyard Cottage in the future!"
1623894,17203130,2014-08-09,15397358,Jesse,"The Ballard Backyard Cottage was perfect for our family of 4.  It had everything we needed - kitchen, laundry, separate spaces for adults and kids to sleep, even some nice outdoor space.  The cottage is lovely and light and well finished.  Lisa was a wonderfully helpful host, happy to offer recommendations and more.  She even offered our kids a bucket of toys.  We were visiting friends in Ballard so this was the perfect lodging solution.  We felt like we had our only private apartment, a retreat for us and our kids.  We would definitely return and recommend it to anyone.  "
1623894,17433609,2014-08-12,15012982,Aileen,"The Ballard backyard cottage was perfect for our little family.  Lisa, Sean and Finn were amazingly sweet! The cottage has everything you need and more to enjoy your stay in Ballard! We walked to downtown with our little baby Rainn (11 months) and really enjoyed the neighborhood and the walks. Lisa was very nice in providing us with yummy goodies in the fridge and a tasty chocolate bar.  Our baby really enjoyed the bucket of toys ready for him when we arrived.  Did I already mention the cottage is absolutely beautiful! "
1623894,17615151,2014-08-15,15577057,Martine,Nice place 
1623894,18055653,2014-08-21,16203296,Melissa,"This was my first airbnb experience and Lisa set the bar high. I loved this cottage and would recommend it to anyone. New, clean, stylish, and comfortable. I was able to walk to the bus and go downtown easily. Lisa helped me with directions and even gave me free bus passes. The kitchen was fully stocked will all equipment necessary for making even a complicated meal, and the fridge and pantry had lots of great basics (butter, PB, cooking oil, etc.). This was a great surprise since I'm a single mom traveling with two small kids and needed to cook for us. My only regret is that I packed our vacation so tight that I didn't get to spend more time with Lisa and her lovely family. My kids made me promise we'll come back and spend more time. And we will. Fabulous place and great owners. Super quiet neighborhood, yet easy to get any place in Seattle you'd like to go. Lisa even had my favorite beer and a chocolate bar waiting for me. A+++"
1623894,18398294,2014-08-26,14900853,Kelly,We had a wonderful stay at Ballard Backyard Cottage.  Our host was very accommodating and friendly.  The place was exceptionally clean and modern.  The beds were comfortable and the shower was hot.  We would definitely stay there again!

1623894,18671030,2014-08-30,271025,Alex,The cottage was outstanding. We really loved all the attention to detail in the construction. The Ballard neighborhood is beautiful. Lisa and her family were great and we would stay here again for sure.
1623894,18874251,2014-09-02,13720661,Erin,"Totally enjoyed the Ballard Backyard. We travelled to Seattle for Bumbershoot with a 6 year old in tow and this place could not of been more perfect. Close to transit (easy commute to downtown), in a great neighbourhood, neat space, our only complaint is that we wished we could of stayed longer. This place exceeded our expectations from the pictures online. "
1623894,19025511,2014-09-05,17087368,Robert,"It was a charming well located property with all of the necessary essentials available.  We felt very welcome.  The neighborhood was great for walking, easy street parking and very accessible to the city.  This was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful.

1623894,19194823,2014-09-08,13008389,Maki,My friends stayed at Lisa's cottage. They told me Lisa was very friendly and welcoming. 
1623894,19375514,2014-09-11,5879809,Katherine,"We had the most wonderful stay at Lisa's backyard cottage.  This place is truly a gem in the heart of Ballard.  The cottage was well-furnished and so much thought has clearly gone into making this place a very functional, cozy and easy home away from home.  There was not a single thing that we needed and couldn't find here!  We were also so grateful for all of the help in making the stay easy on our 17 month old--the cottage had a pack n' play, high chair, big box of books and toys (to her delight!) and plates, utensils, etc. for little hands.  Lisa got us settled in, made sure we were comfortable and was accessible for questions, but the place felt incredibly private as well.  This will most certainly be our pick for a place to stay the next time we're in Seattle!"
1623894,19774814,2014-09-18,18691136,George,"Our stay was wonderful. The cottage was extremely clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Lots of towels, shampoo, lotion, coffee, and much more! Great use of space. Lots of windows to enjoy the cool temperature. Nice shower. The patio was really nice and peaceful…great after a busy day in downtown Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet and there was always on street parking available. Lisa was very friendly and a great host. We highly recommend the Ballard Backyard Cottage!"
1623894,20228116,2014-09-26,17372714,Andrea,"Our stay couldn't have been better. The cottage was clean, comfortable, and stocked with everything we needed. There was enough space and privacy to make the stay enjoyable for a couple + one. Clearly, Lisa and her family put a lot of work and love into this place to make it as warm and welcoming as possible.
The neighborhood was also a delight. At no point did we feel unease travelling back from our night time treks into the city. There are multiple bus stops within walking distance and wonderful restaurants and shops nearby.
Lisa even had vegan toiletries ready for us picky guests. We had a great experience and couldn't recommend her cottage and hospitality enough."
1623894,20765171,2014-10-05,21019441,Leigh,"This gem of a cottage was great, I lucked out as it was terrific weather in the Seattle area and I was able to walk to my destination everyday, the neighborhood was safe and very walkable to the surrounding area.  The cottage was clean and well appointed.  I didn't get a chance to meet the host as my schedule was really busy but it was all so well organized I did not need to ask for anything."
1623894,21155569,2014-10-12,2479220,Kevin,"What a great place.  The Ballard Backyard Cottage is a wonderful place to spend a few days.  The neighbourhood is great - easy access to food and drink, transport.   The space is well organized and comfortable, the check-in process was easy and everything needed was available.  Thank you Lisa.  "
1623894,21304070,2014-10-14,21487859,Shannan,"Better than the description! Humidity controller in the bathroom and surround sound on the TV set up??  This is a very well appointed, modern, clean place in the trendy Ballard neighborhood.  The friend and rotund feline addition is also a nice touch. 

Lisa even met us 2 days before our reservation to let us drop off plants so that we could go to Canada without fear of getting them confiscated.  (Thanks again) 

Great experience; highly recommended. 

"
1623894,22376170,2014-11-04,3985683,Jason,"Lisa was quite responsive and made us feel very welcome! The property itself was great. Very clean, with good amenities and we loved the style. Ballard is a quaint neighborhood, good for relaxing evening walks after exploring the city. I'll definitely recommend Lisa and the Ballard Backyard Cottage to my friends and other colleagues, and hope to stay here again next time in the area!"
1623894,22660050,2014-11-11,10086859,Sandra,"We enjoyed a lovely stay at the Backyard Cottage. The area is quiet and easy to find parking. The place is very clean, comfortable, and well stocked with items for the kitchen and the bathroom. It was a 25 minute walk to NW Market Street and Ballard Ave where you'll find coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping. We had a great time exploring Ballard, doing the Art Walk and Farmer's Market. We also had a fantastic meal at Ocho, a Spanish tapas place."
1623894,23746938,2014-12-09,91995,Lucy,"We had such a great experience at the Ballard Backyard Cottage! Not only was the location and space great, but there is so much attention to detail. Lisa obviously knows what a traveler needs -- especially when traveling with kids. We were so pleased to find things like a step-stool, kid cups, and zip lock bags. We also loved all the local artwork on the walls. We'd love to return the next time we're in Seattle. Thanks Lisa and family! "
1623894,24368830,2014-12-27,23162937,Fran,"It's been a great stay at the cottage!  The place is in great conditions and very well equipped (specially the kitchen). 
Lisa hosted us wonderfully mailing us before our arrival and providing  a crib and a baby feeding seat, very nice from her. 
Definitely I would stay here again my next time in Seattle!"
1623894,24659117,2015-01-01,24119991,Kathy,"This is a newly constructed clean, convenient, comfortable and QUIET
cottage. The hosts were very thoughtful in the design and welcoming touches.  This cottage is convenient to downtown Ballard and Seattle buses.
We would not hesitate to book this location again."
1623894,25331622,2015-01-12,25434014,Corinne,"We arrived late at night to the cottage, and Lisa had left the heat running so it was nice and warm when we arrived.  The cottage was clean and neat and beautiful.  
The kitchen was well stocked with all pots, pans, dishes etc you would need, including a fridge, microwave, an oven, toaster and coffee pot. 
The bathroom was stocked with towels, shampoo & conditioner & lotion, soap, and hair dryer and was gorgeously designed.
And OMG the bed. The bed is a memory foam mattress and sooo comfortable.  It's nicer than my own bed and we slept on a cloud all weekend.  
As for location, it's a few blocks away from a bus stop and about a 1/2 hr journey to downtown Seattle.  It's in a quiet neighborhood and very peaceful.  
This place was great, I highly recommend it, and Lisa was a great host.  "
1623894,25620356,2015-01-20,2895392,Eli,"Great hosts!  Lisa helped with some on-the-fly instructions to get there by bus.  Sean invited me and my 5.5 yr old over to watch the Seahawks come from behind to trounce the Packers.  Neither of us football fans, but our 5 year olds enjoyed playing together and eating popcorn."
1623894,26108687,2015-02-03,9769472,Vanessa,"Thank goodness I had the good judgment to book this cottage when I did.  For our four night stay, it was perfect; close enough to walk to sweet areas of Ballard or to hop on a bus and explore elsewhere. 
The cottage is bright and sunny, open and airy, and feels super clean.  We had everything we needed to get started in the morning (french press=thumbs up), and popping up the bed to let down the breakfast table is a brilliant use of space.  Things just make sense here.    
Lisa is very laid back, really fun to talk to, and had she and her family not been out of town for the weekend, it would have been lovely to have chatted more.  
I felt like we got a really great deal for the price, because everything is so orderly, shiny and new.  The shower is heavenly.  To sum it up, the place left nothing to be desired for us, and when we got some down time to stay in and enjoy it, it was difficult to leave.  I can't wait to come back.  The very cute cat is an additional plus!"
1623894,26196988,2015-02-06,26741287,Ryan,"Lisa was Awesome! We had a family emergency during our stay and they were wonderfully accommodating. We also really appreciated their thoughtfulness to make it toddler friendly. Great location, great space, great people!"
1623894,27805027,2015-03-12,27789818,Michael,"We had a wonderful stay at the Ballard Backyard Cottage. Lisa and Sean are amazing hosts—they went above and beyond in accommodating our requests, providing information on the area, and making us feel at home in Seattle. The cottage is in a great location, was super-clean, and stocked with everything we needed for our stay (including child-friendly items like a step stool, booster seat, and baby gate). Very highly recommended!"
1623894,28251248,2015-03-21,26319029,Margaret,"The Ballard Backyard Cottage was our base for a week for me and my 2 daughters during spring break.  You couldn't want for more.  The decor and finishes, and local artwork on the walls throughout are very tasteful.  Lisa and family have thought of every detail from comfortable beds and bedding, towels in the bath, and everything you need in a kitchen.   We arrived early, but Lisa said we were welcome to check-in ahead of time.  A nice assortment of food--fruit, carrots, bread, and coffee, and a chocolate bar waiting for us was a nice touch.   Finding parking on the street was always easy.  We appreciated Lisa recommendations in her guidebook.   Highly recommend this charming cottage!"
1623894,28418083,2015-03-23,23200475,Christine,"This cottage is spectacular! It's pristine, centrally located and stocked with all the necessities.

1623894,29674923,2015-04-11,28512734,Roxanne,"Lisa was our favourite Airbnb host (are we allowed to say that?). She was friendly, helpful, and she even set out furniture by the cottage so we could catch the morning sun with our coffee. This place is a magic spot in a great location -- a great location for driving/transit/walking around, and Ballard quickly became my favourite neighbourhood. We all agree that we'll never stay anywhere else in Seattle again. You won't regret staying in this beautiful cottage."
1623894,29948474,2015-04-14,30609541,Mary,"This was a perfect spot for us, just what we needed to be close to family  in the area.  The cottage was spotless, and had everything as advertised.  Lisa was helpful and available to us.  This is in a neighborhood, and we had no trouble with parking or noise.  Very cozy.  thanks Lisa"
1623894,30305735,2015-04-20,29099440,Susan,"The cottage is exactly as it looks in the listing. It's clean, neat and though spare, is comfortable. The hostess provides for all your needs. The neighborhood is beautiful - it's about 15 minutes out of the city center. So if you want quiet, comfortable and trendy, you've found the right place. If you want walking distance proximity to downtown attractions, stay in the center. I liked having the peace of being outside of the center. I would stay there again."
1623894,31952846,2015-05-12,5438611,Anita,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage! Everything was pristine and comfortable. Lisa was a great host and helped with any questions we had.

We also loved staying in such a great part of Seattle - we could walk to many great restaurants, but still had a quiet place to relax at the end of the day."
1623894,32274580,2015-05-16,161957,Pat,"Lisa's place was fantastic! It was very clean, spacious and very creative. We have been travel a lot around the world, we know many places but we are sure we are going to remember this house! 

The location is great! The neighborhood is lovely.

My family and I high recommend this place!"
1623894,32477507,2015-05-18,2250415,Jonathan,"Lisa was the best host I've had since using Airbnb.  She's really nice, welcoming, and has a high attention to detail.  I liked all the Seattle/Ballard artwork in the cottage - it really makes it feel like a home.  The neighborhood is great.  It has a suburban feel, but it's only a few miles from downtown.  Easy to get around by either walking or taking buses.  The cottage has several restaurants within walking distance and there are many more in Fremont and Old Ballard within a short drive.  Overall, it was an awesome trip and we will definitely stay there again if we go back to Seattle!"
1623894,33073122,2015-05-25,11596698,Karen,"We loved our stay in Lisa's Backyard Ballard Cottage!  The cottage was beautifully designed with everything we needed for our brief stay in Seattle.

Outdoor space is beautiful as is the neighborhood. Lisa was a great host. She was quick to respond to any questions/needs and incredibly helpful. Also very nice and had many wonderful suggestions for things to do in Seattle and around. Location of the cottage was perfect for a family as there are several beach parks and the zoo within a short drive. We had a rental car and street parking was never an issue. Highly recommend staying at this cottage!"
1623894,34437960,2015-06-08,31369095,Trisha,"Lisa made my first experience renting with AirBnB a pleasure. She answered all my questions quickly and provided some great suggestions on things to do, travel time around town and the state.  The backyard cottage was exactly and described, very neat/clean and ready for us when we arrived. 

The neighborhood is great and had lots of places to eat within walking distance. We ate dinner in the neighborhood each night we stayed there.

On the street parking for our rental car was very easy/convenient as well.

I highly recommend staying in this location if you have the chance, Lisa was a gracious host that gave us our space while balancing the ability to visit with us while we were there."
1623894,34848436,2015-06-13,28502057,Alexander,"Wir verbrachten drei Tage bei Lisa in Ballard nach unserer Landung in Seattle. Als Familie mit kleinen Kindern fanden wir hier den perfekten Ort zum akklimatisieren, mit Ruhe und Verständnis. Lisa gab uns viele Tipps, die Kinder fanden in Finn einen Spielfreund und bei der Ankunft überraschten uns frische Kaffee-Bohnen in der Küche. Das Häuschen ist sehr praktisch uns stilvoll eingerichtet. Wäre auch ein perfekter Ort für einen Arbeitsaufenthalt mit Schreibtisch, W-LAN und Co. 
Vielen Dank Lisa 
Träumen schon von einem nächsten mal. "

1623894,37455688,2015-07-07,30662359,Hannah,"We stayed here for three nights during our mom/daughter trip to Seattle. The Ballard Backyard Cottage was exactly as described and quite perfect for our visit. We especially enjoyed the relaxing outdoor space. Lisa wasn't in town during out stay but she was quick to answer questions when I had them via email. The neighborhood is quite residential but if you don't mind walking, you can easily get to coffee shops and restaurants. I would recommend the cottage to anyone visiting the city, especially families! "
1623894,42214244,2015-08-11,16969512,Joseph,This was a great experience. The property and amenities appear exactly as listed. She went above and beyond to make it feel like home. Ballard is a fun little part of Seattle and definately worth checking out. I would absolutely stay here again. Five out of Five Stars!

1623894,44759674,2015-08-29,5611128,Karla,"Very clean and lovely home with great amenities for our toddler. Cute, friendly cat, too!"
1623894,45278599,2015-09-01,32301458,Rachel,"We absolutely loved our experience staying at the cottage! Lisa was incredibly friendly and welcoming. We had several conversations over the weekend about places to eat and explore. The cottage is in a nice, quiet neighborhood: a short walk to some great bakeries and cafes, and only a 25-minute walk to the Sunday farmer's market. We enjoyed one of our meals out on the patio. The place is spotlessly clean and has a modern feel. We couldn't have asked for a better place or host in Seattle! Also, the cat Buddy is the best. "
1623894,47155939,2015-09-16,746694,Jeremiah,"We had a wonderful week long stay at the cottage! Lisa was an amazing host, she set us up lots of kid/baby supplies so we didn't have to travel with them. The house is immaculate and has all the supplies you need. We particularly enjoyed the comfy bed and wonderful shower. We will definitely try to book this place again the next time we're in Seattle. "
1623894,48066764,2015-09-23,3489842,Melody,"The home is exactly as pictured. Quiet, clean, and quite lovely. It's a ""tiny home"" but the use of space is really well situated. We had two people stay in the cottage. One used the upstairs murphy bed and the other used the downstairs futon. It's the most comfortable futon that I've ever slept on. Don't know what kind of mattress they use, but it's not all lumpy and thin like a lot of futon mattresses. 

Unfortunately, Lisa was out of town so we didn't have an opportunity to meet. But she left clear directions in the cottage and gave us some tips through the site before we arrived. She also left some coffee for us to use in the mornings.

The location is great in Ballard. There are a couple breakfast spots that we walked to nearby in the morning. We ubered our way into the city. Cost of travel, depending on time of day and surge, was $10-15 per trip. But I appreciated being in a quiet neighborhood instead of the loud city center.  "
1623894,49754794,2015-10-05,5209502,Michelle,"Lisa's Ballard Backyard Cottage is a perfect place to stay if you love Ballard. Beautifully and quietly placed in a great neighborhood close to some great coffee shops and parks. Lisa was easy to communicate with and made our arrival after a long journey very welcoming. The cottage looked exactly as it does in the photos, plus many nice extras like a comfortable bed and environmental features in the structure of the cottage. Parking was easy if you have a car. 
"
1623894,51615680,2015-10-22,42277368,Jordan,"Ballard Backyard Cottage is set in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. Lisa was really responsive to enquiries and made us feel really welcome being my first trip to the US.

Parking is expensive in Seattle and being able to park for free in front of the cottage was really helpful.

The cottage itself is fully equipped with everything we need. The rooms are thoughtfully furnished and decorated. Beds were really comfortable too!

Thanks Lisa for hosting our trip to Seattle. Our stay couldn't have been better!"
1623894,52086404,2015-10-26,8924305,Chris,"We arrived late on Thursday night after a long flight from Boston. Lisas house was easy to find and easy to find parking. We walked into a beautiful -very clean home.  The house was perfect .
  It was quite and peaceful yet close to the city. This house is nestled in a beautiful setting surrounded by a large inviting deck with very pretty gardens and trees.
 My husband and I enjoyed watching the three chickens run around next door while having our morning coffee.
 Thank you Lisa for leaving us all we needed for a fresh healthy breakfast. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. 
We look forward to coming back soon and staying at your lovely home again.
Thank you!

The cottage is spotlessly clean and cared for with a particularly comfortable bed - the main things I look for in excellent accommodation. Ballard is a lovely quiet area with coffee shops, a few bars and places to eat. Transport into downtown Seattle is easy and cheap from a nearby bus stop. Great to stay in a quiet residential area whilst still being able to easily enjoy and explore the main city area. Thank you Lisa and Sean."
1623894,55856480,2015-12-06,48368173,Tate,"Lisa's cottage was amazing! It provided a great space for me to relax, get some work done, cook a few meals, and get a good night's sleep. Lisa and her husband were very accommodating with my check in times and made it easy for me to get in and make myself at home. The cottage was spotless and well appointed. Location was very easy to get to Ballard or downtown while not having to deal with the hassle of traffic and parking. I highly recommend their cottage and I am already planning to book a return trip!"
1623894,56140803,2015-12-09,26088077,Jennifer,"The backyard cottage was awesome! We never met Lisa but had messaged a few times back and forth. When we arrived, her husband said hello and told us to let them know if we needed anything, which we didn't because the cottage was perfect! Super cute!! Easy parking and very close to the cute downtown Ballard bar/restaurant area. I would stay there again. "
1623894,56956762,2015-12-20,873410,Edgardo,"She was super friendly and met us shortly after arrival. Very accommodating and offered assistance with anything we might need. The place even was stocked with some basic snacks and food items which were perfect for our 4 year old to snack on as we got settled. 

The cottage is so cute and wonderful. In fact, 1 night stay here and you'll be looking to find a way to build your own!"
1623894,57663745,2015-12-28,19755813,Emily,"Our stay at the Ballard Backyard Cottage was absolutely lovely. The cottage itself was adorable, well-located, quiet, comfy, impeccably clean and overall perfect for our needs. Lisa was an excellent host and made us feel right at home with yummy chocolate, coffee and champagne waiting for us. We couldn't recommend this little cottage more and will definitely be back."
1060467,5074946,2013-06-10,1592960,Ari,Really nice cozy place. The room has a perfect view of the needle and the building is newly constructed with a modern feel. And a good  location between the downtown area and Queen Anne. Thanks Hande! 
1060467,5138353,2013-06-14,2326846,Amirtha,"Great location and a helpful host, Hande! I liked having the private bed and the bath."
1060467,6039052,2013-07-27,7660946,Kerth,"The accommodation felt safe and private; I found it quiet and clean as well. Hande made my arrival and departure times easy to arrange. A view south of the apartment includes Puget Sound, and Hande pointed out there's also a balcony on the south side of the apartment, which she welcomed me to use if I liked. "
1060467,6267129,2013-08-05,2655409,Jan-Erik,"I had a very pleasant stay in Hande's apartment. The place is super nice and located in a quite area close to some cool spots. Hande was very friendly and helpful. And yes, the view from the room is awesome. THANKS Hande!"
1060467,6380935,2013-08-10,4150890,Eve,"My stay with Hande was great!  Check-in was a breeze and her apartment is clean and modern, in a central location, and has a great view of the city.  Overall, it was a lovely experience."
1060467,6439863,2013-08-12,7699768,Jessica,"I am giving Hande 5-stars for her kindness and patience. Due to flight delays, missed connections, and weather I had an awful time getting to Seattle. After three planes and still a ways to go, I decided to turn around and go home.  Through it all I was contacting her in between flights on what was essentially a trip to nowhere, and she was responsive and helpful. I appreciate her understanding and can imagine she makes a lovely host."
1060467,6575407,2013-08-17,318952,Edwin,Super clean and comfortable apartment. Hande was ver kind and sweet. Would live to stay again!
1060467,6745844,2013-08-23,6080132,Amy,Hande's place offers a perfect view of Seattle and it is located within walking distance to downtown (15 minutes or so). I stayed here 3 nights in August and I would recommend it to others! Her place is modern and clean and I was able to find free parking a couple blocks away. Starbucks is right down the street for morning coffee/tea. Hande was also available for questions and advice on the city. 
1060467,6949473,2013-08-31,8333094,Retta,Beautiful apartment in the heart of Queen Anne !
1060467,7002184,2013-09-02,5265224,Alex,Thanks Hande for being a thoughtful and accommodating host. The space was comfortable and quiet with panoramic views of the Sound.  Two thumbs up!
1060467,7083461,2013-09-05,1767539,Eric,"Hande was a very polite and accommodating host, full marks! The room itself is cozy but very nice with great decorations and a great view of the Space Needle. It's an awesome location with a short walk to a lot of great locations. It's a few blocks from Scoot Around, which does scooter rentals and made for a very fun stay in Seattle (though I wouldn't recommend scooting in the rain). Definitely would stay again!"
1060467,7990682,2013-10-11,9137173,Jonathan,"Hande was a very kind host, it was a pleasure to stay at her apartment which was quiet, clean and really comfortable. I’d highly recommend staying there if you’re visiting Seattle and certainly would do so again myself. Thank you Hande…!"
1060467,8711512,2013-11-12,3129032,Scott,"I stayed with Hande overnight in Seattle. The experience was perfect. I had a very comfortable stay, and Hande's place was clean, well situated and safe. Highly recommended!"
1060467,10119193,2014-02-01,8316366,Thomas,"Merveilleux séjour grâce à Hande ! C'est une hôtesse attentionnée, qui a accepté de m'attendre longtemps (l'avion avait du retard et je ne suis arrivé qu'à minuit). Un grand verre d'eau et des biscuits m'attendaient dans la chambre (c'est une attention que j'ai bien appréciée).
La chambre était sommairement décrite sur le site, mais à l'arrivée, j'ai découvert qu'elle était magnifique avec une vue imprenable sur le Space Needle, attraction touristique majeure de Seattle.
L'appartement de Hande est très moderne et parfaitement tenu. Il est clair, calme, au dernier étage d'un immeuble neuf de 6 étages.
La salle de bain particulière est propre et suffisamment grande.
Le quartier est très sympa et on y trouve tout ce qu'il faut pour vivre. Le centre ville est assez proche et bien desservi en transports en commun.
Merci Hande pour tout le confort et votre sympathie."
1060467,10667346,2014-03-02,5139931,Francisco And Lina,"This place has an awesome location and cool view from the bedroom. Hande is really nice and always made sure we felt comfortable, she even gave us cookies for our ride back home =)"
1060467,11872511,2014-04-17,546182,Kayathri,"Handee was an amazing host during my visit - She responded quickly to my messages (before and during my visit) and even provided me with museli bars a couple of times during my stay! 

The pictures don't lie about the view, and both the room and the bathroom were clean. 

She is a great host that I would highly recommend. "
1060467,12258524,2014-04-27,14345740,Florian,"Très bonne expérience, quartier paisible juste a côté du Space Needle et de L'EMP.
Hôte très sympathique, qui vous fait toute confiance en vous donnant les clefs de chez elle.
Super séjour.  "
1060467,12946327,2014-05-15,5474641,Caroline,"Hande wasn't able to greet me upon my arrival and there was a miscommunication. Hande lives in an apartment building. She left the keys under her mat but due to the secured entrance I couldn't get in until someone gave me entrance. Neither her nor AirBnB sent me her apartment number. I had difficult time reaching her for over an hour despite calling, texting, emailing and messaging. Eventually, I called AirBnB Emergency Line who was able to check the apartment number for me.

So yes, it was a rough check-in. This all being said, the apartment has the most gorgeous views of Seattle Centre. The room looks out to the Seattle Space Needle. (You can take wonderful shots throughout the day and night.) The home is clean. The room is a good size and there's even a TV. Hande's a nice and generous person offering me breakfast in the morning and left a granola bar in my room."
1060467,13079659,2014-05-19,13829806,Stephanie,The apartment and neighborhood were awesome - just as listed. Hande was very nice and a wonderful host. Would definitely stay again!
1060467,13853106,2014-06-06,8636538,Burak,Great neighborhood. Easy parking. 
1060467,14201731,2014-06-14,16140925,Austin,"The room was great.  Private bathroom.  Great views. Quiet. Awesome host.

The neighborhood was also great.  Short walk to the space needle.  Quick bus or cab downtown.  It was a great spot."
1060467,14559895,2014-06-22,14639366,Ginny,"Hande was a gracious host.  The room was as advertised, very clean and a great view in a fairly quiet neighborhood. She was at the apartment upon my arrival, but had made arrangements beforehand about gaining entrance if she was not home.  The private bathroom was also very clean.  Great location only a couple blocks from Seattle Center with ample street parking and bus lines to downtown and CenuryLink Field."
1060467,14882695,2014-06-28,16788522,Michael,"Hande was very helpful and courteous. Her location is great since the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, several cafes, and many sites are within walking distance. Her apartment view is fantastic- the balcony even welcomes ocean air :) She was kindly flexible about our need to have luggage checked out later in the day. Great value and kind person! :) Thanks, Hande!   "
1060467,15018163,2014-06-30,16841747,Mingyang,Hande has provided me an clear instruction about the house. The house is very  clean and  easy to find. Hande has been very nice and patient to me. She is also considerate about my check-in time. It is so lucky for me to have her being my landlord in Seattle. I high recommend the room to the people who will come to the Seattle.
1060467,15690115,2014-07-14,12514452,Tracy,"It was a great trip! Hande's place was so very close to the big Seattle Center! Clean and convenient, private and friendly."
1060467,16212545,2014-07-23,16755756,Lisa,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it worked out quite well.  
There was a little confusion when I first arrived, which was remedied by Hande within twenty minutes, so no biggie.  But I learned to always reconfirm the day before arrival. 
Though I did not see Hande very frequently during my stay, she was kind and respectful and quiet.
The room was clean and the view was amazing. (As is the view from the balcony).  I was mesmerized by the space needle.   It is a busy/lively neighborhood, so during the summer (when sleeping with the window open is necessary)  I recommend bringing earplugs if you are sensitive to traffic/noise.  The bed was not super comfy, but it worked.
The bathroom was immaculate, which I greatly appreciated.
There is great coffee within a couple of blocks (Uptown Espresso), a wonderful 24 hour grocery store (the Metropolitan) that is less than a ten minute walk and loads of restaurants and shops nearby. 
Thank you Hande for a good introduction to airbnb, I appreciate you sharing your space!
"
1060467,16318983,2014-07-25,1912284,Sean,"Hande's place was just as advertised, a nice clean room in a walkable location to all of the downtown destinations.  Hande left us cereal bars which was a nice touch.  We did not meet Hande during our trip, but she was always quick to answer our messages.

If you find yourself in Seattle and only need a minimal amount of amenities, Hande's place is a great find."
1060467,16498198,2014-07-28,17872575,Linda,"yes, the host made us feel welcome.  We should have checked on parking too.  The apartment was clean.  We were only renting the room."
1060467,17005459,2014-08-05,18099259,Lexi,"Our first trip to Seattle was perfect thanks to Hande's Modern Private Room - convenient, clean, and comfortable! My daughter and I particularly loved the view of the Space Needle right outside our window. Hande gave great instructions for check in and left a welcome note and snack bars, which were much appreciated after our long flight, and she was quick to respond when I sent her messages. We spent our days attending our event at the Seattle Center, sightseeing, and eating great meals - the location is perfect for walking and short uber trips (another Hande recommendation)! We were so busy, our paths never crossed - I'm sorry we didn't get to meet her in person!"
1060467,17769400,2014-08-17,18035075,Joseph,Host was pleasant.  Accommodation was accurate and the location suited our needs.
1060467,17948155,2014-08-19,4101920,Xiaowei,"The apartment is very nice, location is very close to Space Needle. Hande is a great host, I highly recommend this place to whom wants to travel to Seattle."
1060467,18248261,2014-08-24,17813561,Peter,Awesome view very close to Seattle Center and family owned restaurants. Information sheet with wireless login got me connected fast. Great trip to Seattle!
1060467,18553951,2014-08-28,19300530,Anne,I arrive after journeying from Vancouver. When I got to the apartments there was no reply to my phone call. I was standing in the street with my suitcases. Fortunately someone came and unlocked and I managed to get in. I found the key. Had a text 2 hours later!  Was disappointed no one was staying in the flat and was a bit nervous. Didn't meet my host at all. Couldn't use the lounge  and no clothes washing facility. No where to hang clothes. Sometimes the wifi didn't work.
1060467,18873687,2014-09-02,15314841,David,"Hande was quick to communicate and friendly.  She provided me with everything I needed.  The location was perfect for my trip to Bumbershoot.  If I go again next year, I'll certainly be seeing if her space is available."
1060467,19387785,2014-09-11,8118662,Sandra,"Wir haben die Gastgeberin nur kurz gesehen, aber es war trotzdem kein Problem mit dem check in. Das Appartment ist sauber und der Blick auf den Space Needle wirklich ganz toll. Eine Baustelle nebenan machte es nur tagsüber etwas laut. In der Nähe ist das schöne Belltown mit vielen Kneipen und auch in die Stadtmitte ist es nicht wirklich weit. Ein bisschen beengt, weil es keinen Schrank gibt um Klamotten oder Koffer zu verstauen. Ein paar Kleiderhaken, vielleicht an der Tür ? wären schön. Ansonsten aber ein schöner Aufenthalt im sonnigen Seattle."
1060467,19536292,2014-09-14,19865059,Perry,"Stayed at Hande's place for three nights and it was exactly as advertised.  A very nice, clean minimal setup which was exactly what I needed.  Definitely close to the hustle and bustle, and I would stay here again."
1060467,19962511,2014-09-21,5907484,Shenglan,"I had a great Stay at Hande's apartment. It is very clean and close to everything. Will stay there again next time I visit Seattle!

Shenglan He"
1060467,20212778,2014-09-25,17417751,Elizabeth,"I enjoyed the opportunity to stay with Hande while I was in Seattle.  Her place was very clean and it was a great base from which to explore the city.  She was kind enough to offer me an umbrella, as the weather proved to be a little rainy, and was also willing to offer suggestions for what to do in the area.  Be mindful that if you have a rental car, parking in this area is a little tricky, but it was very close to a lot of the downtown attractions, which was great.  "
1060467,22679849,2014-11-11,23295920,Grace,Hande and her fiance were wonderful hosts. They were very welcoming but also respectful of the times when I just wanted private time alone. The room is exactly as advertised - clean and super close to transit stops. There's good water pressure in the shower and dependable wireless internet. Definitely a worthwhile experience. 
1060467,26567701,2015-02-15,26562922,Juntao,"I love this room and had three great nights at Hande's place. The room and bathroom are clean, neat and comfortable. Hande and his cute dog, Nox were very friendly and nice. She also gave me the city pass so I could use it to take bus. Location is also very good to everywhere in Seattle. I highly recommend this room and Hande! "
1060467,28011589,2015-03-16,24655498,Ariam,"I'm so glad I got to spend my last 2 days in Seattle at Hande's home. She was such a spectacular host. She and her fiance always made me feel welcome in her home. They were complete sweethearts. I was able to keep in communication with her and she always responded back quickly. I felt so bad when I had a small train fiasco making me late to meet her, but she was completely understanding. They recommended a diner to go to and gave me snacks for the road while I stayed here. The walk to the space needle is only a couple blocks away and the view from the room was even better than it's pictured. I definitely recommend staying here! I really enjoyed my stay here and can't wait to come back! Thank you for everything!"
1060467,28616852,2015-03-27,28760810,Essa,"warm welcome, nice clean room, perfect space needle view. "
1060467,30369575,2015-04-20,31409668,Alex,"The space was just as represented - perfect view of the Seattle skyline, close proximity to attractions and transit. Hande worked with me to set up checking in at the last minute and keeps her space spotless. The balcony is not large at all, but it's enough to put you outside to take in the scene from a higher floor. Make sure you're patient with the building key; it sometimes sticks and doesn't turn."
1060467,30560863,2015-04-24,11954710,Will,"I highly recommend staying here. Hande was a fantastic hostess. The room/apartment was beautiful, clean and in a great location. Would definitely come back! "
1060467,32972277,2015-05-24,3821079,Lourdes,Hande was a lovely host! The room and apartment were exactly as listed. The view from the room is amazing. Hande offered great tips for the city and we shared some great conversation during our stay. It's a in a nice quiet part of town that's walkable to the downtown hustle and bustle. Would love to stay again some time! Thank you Hande!
1060467,33790389,2015-06-01,1880251,Katie,We enjoyed our stay here! The location is great for exploring the city.  The place is just as described. Would visit again!
1060467,34416037,2015-06-08,30078690,John,My stay in Seattle was delightful.  Hande made me feel welcome and very comfortable.  The accommodations were clean and pleasing.  It was very relaxing and easy to come and go from this lovely location.  I am hoping to book future visits to stay with Hande when my travels take me to Seattle. 
1060467,35209590,2015-06-16,27543261,Jarrah,Hande was a great. Easy to contact in order to organise arrival and departure. The apartment was very clean and tidy and in a fantastic location with views of the Space Needle! They were full of great tips on places to eat and things to see. Highly recommend!
1060467,35681434,2015-06-21,33614308,Li,房屋的位置特别好，具体西雅图中心步行三分钟就到，派克市场也就步行15分钟，沿着门口的路一路爬坡上去就到海德公园了，那是看西雅图最棒的地方
1060467,36281566,2015-06-27,29039033,Amanda,"Hande and her boyfriend were very nice and welcoming and we felt comfortable there. The only thing I would say future guests should be aware of is that there is no air conditioning. In fact, most places in Seattle don't have air conditioning.  We are from the Midwest where AC is standard so we were a little surprised by that. However, I think we were there during the hottest week of the year. Hande and her apartment are great, but if you plan to go in the summer time, just bring some hand held fans and you should be fine :) "
1060467,38027680,2015-07-12,18694830,Yingqi,"Although Hande was not at home when we arrived, she provided detailed instructions and it was easy to get into the building. Hande was very nice. The location was also great! Really close to the Space Needle and a short walk to downtown. I enjoyed my stay there!"
1060467,38406465,2015-07-15,35261765,Kevin,"My hosts greeted me when I arrived, showed me where everything was and how to use their WiFi.

They were both very friendly. 

The room was in a modern building with a spectacular view of the Space Needle. It was very clean and comfortable.

The building is in a nice, quiet neighborhood, with several pubs and restaurants. Downtown was a short walk, and even closer with public transportation."
1060467,38881418,2015-07-19,36259966,Tyler,"Hande and her boyfriend made me feel immediately comfortable staying in their place for 4 nights in Seattle.  This was actually the first time I've tried a private room style Airbnb, and I couldn't have picked a better host!  The checkin went smoothly and Hande was able to accommodate the fact that I had arrived earlier than I had planned (thanks for that!).  Hande was also very kind in asking if I needed anything at all and made some great suggestions on what to do around Seattle.

The room's view is such a cool view, and being able to see the Space Needle in plain sight was awesome fall asleep and wake up to.  It was also exactly as described: clean, simple, and quiet.

The neighborhood is just far enough away from the downtown frenzy yet still accessible to all the hot spots of the area.  I was able to grab a bus a few blocks away that took me way over to Ballard, it was pretty easy!

Thanks for wonderful stay, Hande!"
1060467,42710712,2015-08-15,35776540,Olivia,"Hande's apartment was just as described. It was quiet, clean, and has a wonderful view of the space needle! We enjoyed the close walk to downtown and the proximity to the water. Checking in was quite easy. There is no air conditioning in the apartment, but Hande did what she could to make us comfortable. If you like a cool room I would suggest bringing a fan with you in the summer. Overall, we had a wonderful stay! "
1060467,43383361,2015-08-19,37510327,Anne-Sophie,"We had a perfect stay at Hande's place. 
Hande welcomed U.S. and made us feel at home instantly. The room is exactly as described, with an amazing view. The flat is very nice and quiet, and Hande is always helpful without being too present. 
Location is perfect- close to the Seattle center and main sights of Seattle, with restaurants and shops nearby, and the city centre is within walking distance - or quite easy to reach via transport. The waterfront is also very close and provides nice running options. 
I strongly recommend Hande's, and would definitely go back to hers should we have to visit Seattle again! "
1060467,44173911,2015-08-24,7365048,Jessica,"Hande, her boyfriend, and Knox (sp?) were awesome!! Despite my late night flight (1 am), they still welcomed me and made me feel comfortable. The entire stay, they were super polite and nice. The room was also awesome. When they say 'amazing view,' they definitely mean it. The window stares directly at the space needle, which when lit up at night, is gorgeous. Additionally, I was in Seattle for a conference in the exhibition hall downtown. The location was phenomenal, as it only took me ten minutes to walk there or get anything to eat. Overall, I would recommend anything hosted by Hande."
1060467,44672460,2015-08-28,26296594,Suzanne,"Everything was as described. Very nice room with great view and private bathroom. As long as you like dogs, you'll enjoy your stay with Hande and her very sweet dog."
1060467,45069938,2015-08-31,33993135,Wade,"Hande and her boyfriend have a wonderful, cozy little room with a great view. And an adorable dog. I had a great stay. "
1060467,46169578,2015-09-08,25373825,Kristen,"Hande was great! After a slight delay (my mistake for not contacting with check-in instructions earlier) upon arrival in Seattle, everything was smooth. The view from the room is absolutely fantastic and everything was very clean and tidy. Hande and her boyfriend even cooked dinner one night and shared with me--so nice! It was great to have a designated, private bathroom as well. The neighborhood is easily walkable to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, great restaurants and shopping--really everything feels close so you can spend more time enjoying Seattle!"
1060467,46669197,2015-09-12,35439225,Patricia,"First I did not stay in this room. When I arrived on the 9th, access downstairs for 20 minutes. When I successfully entered the room, I felt the room was too chaos with clothes and staff (website hidden)'s definitely looks like on the picture so nice and nest! Second, the debris too much room, entrance and living room are all of clothing, with no spare places. We live in a single room bed sheets touch feeling not clean, so immediately decided to give this place. Because I did not cancel 7 days in advance, you can only pay the full cost.             It gave me a lesson: 1. Slow response before homeowners do not choose 2. Do not believe all the pictures, the picture of room is clean, in fact the room is full of debris 3. Quality of life a little bit friends can Choose a small hotel, because public toilets really can not adapt."
1060467,48046907,2015-09-22,20585148,Jeff,Hande was nice and accomodating. She used KeyCafe to give us our own set of keys w/o having to be in the same place at the same time.  She also respected our privacy very much.  The room had a terrific view of the Space Needle and the apartment was in a great part of town.
1060467,51133090,2015-10-18,42242386,Sydney,"I got there a but early and they had forgotten the key, but they came home pretty quickly to let me in. Their dog Rox was super sweet too. He wasn't sure about me everytime I came in the door but quickly realized he had someone else to pet him. The listing is spot on. The view is amazing. The neighborhood is good. Short walk to just about everything. And if not the bus stop is right there. All kinds of food in the area. And the Space Needle/Center is only a couple of blocks away. "
8704931,52949806,2015-11-02,39662877,Mary,"My boyfriend and I were Walter's first guests in his bottom level in-law apartment. We had a wonderful stay. The house was brand new with very nice appliances and a comfortable couch and bed.  Walter was friendly and very helpful in making our stay everything we were looking for.  The house is in a great neighborhood, we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. "
8704931,54935549,2015-11-25,47803905,Tracy,"Walter's apartment is nice and new, and everything was clean and comfortable. Walter was friendly and helpful, and offered several recommendations for things to do/places to eat in the area. We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay here again!"

They were very accommodating to our schedule and needs and had great recommendations/tips to enjoy both in Seattle and surrounding neighborhoods. Every detail was in place including hot and cold beverages, fresh cut flowers, doggie bags, and a down comforter! The bed and fold out couch were super comfy. They also provided an air mattress for my extra family members. The place is very new and modern and in a great residential neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again!"
8704931,56734211,2015-12-17,43719815,Cheryl & Gene,Our stay at Walter's mother in law apt was great.. They thought of everything and we were so comfortable.  Appreciate doggy friendly people!!! Thanks again. 
8704931,58143721,2016-01-01,47348469,Brian,"This place is very nice, cozy, and clean. We were so happy to find this hotel-like home. Our family really enjoyed staying here for our Seattle vacation. The place is also fairly close to downtown (~12 min driving). We were able to fine everything we needed when we arrived, and Walter was able to assist us through the phone when needed. I would highly recommended anyone to stay here."
9233533,54219390,2015-11-16,11533511,Kim,Our stay at Tina's home was just what we needed. Very comfortable and well stocked with everything one could possibly need. Charming and helpful hosts.  Slept like a baby on the memory foam mattress!  Would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking in North Seattle.
9233533,54808326,2015-11-23,7321935,Heather,"The house was beautiful and spacious and Tina was so great. I will definitely be staying here again. Great location, free parking and affordable."
9233533,55143387,2015-11-28,8052919,James,"Tina's garden apartment met all of our expectations and even more: it is spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated with comfortable furniture, and conveniently located in north Seattle.  It seemed to have everything needed to make us feel at home, including fresh fruit and the essentials for breakfast.  Tina is a good communicator, greeted us warmly, and was sure that all was in order for a perfect stay."

6133354,33283660,2015-05-26,32095893,Natalie,"This was my first experience using airbnb and Kim has certainly set a very high standard! The accommodations were beautiful, the personal touches made the space feel warm and inviting.  The neighborhood was just a short drive to downtown and there were so many restaurants with in walking distance. Had we stayed anywhere else I'm not sure our trip would have been as wonderful and relaxing as it was. "
6133354,34742074,2015-06-11,34620284,Barbara,"Kim's home is very inviting and comfortable. When entering the foyer, a welcome greeting was seen on a small chalkboard at the entrance to my room. The appointments were perfect, the cold beverages were great and there was a variety of nibbles. I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed. Kim is an open caring person. I wish I could have stayed longer and spent more time with her on the upper level patio. Her studio was private and very affordable. I look forward to staying with her again in Seattle when traveling with my daughter. "
6133354,35356264,2015-06-17,35747200,Karen,"This accommodation was beautiful, comfortable, and in a great location. This host thought of virtually everything a guest might need, from shampoo to guidebooks two snacks. The environment was immaculate, sophisticated and comfortable. I give this accommodation 15 stars out of 10!! If I return to Seattle, I will definitely check into booking this accommodation again."
6133354,35480196,2015-06-19,10660702,Ellen,"Kim's studio is indeed awesome.  We have never before been in such a luxurious and sophisticated space:  much like the picture but more amazing.  Kim was very flexible with a sudden change in our plans which was appreciated.  When we arrived we found a well stocked feast of foods, snacks, toiletries and other amenities.  The towels were plush.  The Murphy bed (our first) was extremely comfortable. The backyard deck was also fabulous.  We had no trouble parking in the neighborhood which was quiet, residential and safe.  

We were unable to stay long at Kim's studio due to scheduling.  If we had stayed longer, we weren't sure whether the lack of windows would have become a problem.  
"
6133354,36023970,2015-06-24,2961207,Gary,"Great little place in a very nice location - easy access from airport on public transportation, close to great little restaurants, grocery store, farmer's market, Washington Park, Japanese Garden, very quiet street and neighborhood, within walking distance of downtown.  The place is exactly as described and very clean, well appointed, stocked with snacks and beverages and toiletries.  Kim provided very detailed instructions and information about the neighborhood.  Great stay, it's about as 5star as you can get on Airbnb."
6133354,36430324,2015-06-28,22583028,Lindsey,"We enjoyed our stay so much we decided to extend our time in Seattle one more night. Kim was very accommodating to this request. The studio itself is decorated so nicely and it feels very comfortable. The bed was great too! At first I was a little nervous about the location because it didn't seem near much when we were driving in, but it was great!!! We walked ALOT and whether it was down to Madison park or pikes market we were totally able to make it. UBERS were used when we didn't want to walk and it was a very cheap ride. I would highly recommend this location to anyone. "
6133354,37158137,2015-07-05,30539161,Doris,The host was welcoming and friendly. 
6133354,38389563,2015-07-15,5555427,Beth,"
Kim's studio in the heart of Seattle's Madison Park neighborhood was perfect for us as it was very convenient to our daughter's house and to several bakeries and restaurants nearby.  Kim has thought of everything you will need from snacks and breakfast items in the fridge to a first aid kit and a pair of scissors.  She provides many items we did not see in our other Airbnb locations such as a selection of hair products and bath gels. The fish pond and outdoor seating area are just perfect in the summer in Seattle.  This location is comfortable and well stocked with many, many thoughtful touches! "
6133354,38711683,2015-07-18,7406480,Beth,"Loved staying at Kim's studio! Very lush, livable digs! The bed slept great! And the koi pond and patio were amazing! Given that I was ill when we visited, I was so grateful for having such a nice place to stay! Kim went over and above to help us! Fantastic place, fantastic host!"
6133354,39396632,2015-07-23,169166,Randall,Kim was a gracious host who made us feel welcome when we arrived with a nice bottle of wine and a few snacks to tide us over until we went out for dinner and music. The property is well maintained and is situated in a quiet location with ample parking. 
6133354,39703442,2015-07-25,38178847,Piyush,The apt was as pictured. Bed and bath was comfortable. Kim is a wonderful person and makes you very welcome. 
6133354,40094992,2015-07-28,33588359,Stefano,"Kim provided a lovely studio,  fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. This was my first airbnb experience and she exceed my expectations.  The neighbourhood was nice,  with several restaurants within a short walk.  It was a short drive to downtown,  which was perfect. "
6133354,40751026,2015-08-02,35281376,Phil,"Kim greeted me upon my arrival, gave me a tour of the property - the apartment and the garden area. It was a very comfortable property and easy to access different parts of Seattle. The property doesn't have many windows, so it was warm while I was there (the entire region was baking) and the fans ran the entire time. Kim offered snacks, coffee, and a bottle of wine as the hostess, all greatly appreciated. "
6133354,42861973,2015-08-16,36162132,Dave,"Kim was a wonderful host, and made us feel very welcome. We didn't feel we were staying in someone's home - we felt we were in our own place. The studio was beautifully decorated and full of snacks, drinks, and everything to make our stay enjoyable. The outdoor lounge area and koi pond were an oasis for relaxing and reading.

There was lots of information about what to see and do, plus recommendations for local restaurants.

The location is very convenient to both auto and bus travel, and there are a number of local shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.

If you've never been to Seattle, prepare yourself for a hilly experience."
6133354,43321168,2015-08-18,4491961,Andrew,"Kim was super easy to communicate with and her place was easy to find.    The place was very clean and she had done a great job of providing instructions for everything in the place.  

It doesn't have windows but plenty of light comes in when you leave the french doors open which was fine for me since I was out and about for most of my stay.

Would definitely stay here again."
6133354,44306470,2015-08-25,37266856,Kristine,"Our host Kim was so nice and thoughtful.  We had a baby with us and she had all these toys and a pack and play set up to make our baby feel right at home.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet, but just a few blocks down there are restaurants and coffee shops.  We drove a car because of baby, and there was plenty of free street parking.   Her place was lovely and and you can tell she really thought of all the little things one would need.  My husband forgot his charger so she found us one.  Just a really lovely lady and really beautiful studio.  "
6133354,44980098,2015-08-30,39246382,Helen,The place was great and had everything we could need for a great vacation in Seattle.  Kim went above and beyond to make our son feel comfortable- providing a crib and toys for him during his stay!  
6133354,45275189,2015-09-01,38951051,Daniel,"Everything was perfect. Kim was awesome. She had great suggestions of places to go and eat in Seattle as well as in the neighborhood. The studio was perfect for me and my girlfriend.The bed and furniture were very comfy. Kim left the studio  supplied with snacks, drinks, and even a complimentary bottle of wine which was awesome. We give this studio and Kim an A+++."
6133354,46994686,2015-09-14,18065269,New,"Kim did a fantastic job in welcoming me to her studio. Upon arrival there was a ""Welcome Ron"" at the front of the door. I thought this was a nice warm touch. Beautiful studio and I would love to rent from Kim again. 5/5!!!"
6133354,47593648,2015-09-20,31875711,Devin,"Kim was a lovely host.  She was easy to coordinate with and clearly has a passion for hosting.

The one downside was that the apartment didn't have any windows, which made it stuffy.  I wish the lack of windows had been in the post about the place."
6133354,47807114,2015-09-21,22589891,Christina,"We had a terrific stay at the studio. Kim made everything very easy and the space was just as advertised, clean and comfortable. We appreciated the many thoughtful details, like the yummy snacks and drinks. The studio is centrally located and parking was super easy, right in front of the house. 

We would happily stay at the studio on our next trip to Seattle! "
6133354,48933257,2015-09-29,31700045,Walter,"Kim was very welcoming and accommodating! The studio had everything we needed and then some. It was clean, quiet, and just what we needed after a day of walking up and down the hills of Seattle. The location was just a short walk or Uber from the places we wanted to explore. 

Kim was very responsive during our entire stay. We had a small issue the second day, shot her a text, and she took care of it right away. Everything was so comfortable we extended our stay one night!"
6133354,51493496,2015-10-20,46040582,Xinyi,Kim's house is so cozy，making you feel like being at your own home. It is really a wonderful experience. 
6133354,52992433,2015-11-03,8688149,Daune,"My experience was excellent! I thought everything was great; the location, the ease, the friendliness, the hospitality.
I will definitely be back."
6133354,56929063,2015-12-20,26271699,Susan,"Kim was an amazing host! She was super accommodating and very responsive to text messages whenever I needed something. As a longer term guest, I was able to do laundry in her main home, which was so convenient. The space is also well decorated and cozy, and the Keurig was an added plus for sure."
4181226,24050064,2014-12-18,22662910,Natalya,"I stayed with Jessica for a month. I was in Seattle as a nursing student finishing up a clinical intensive, so it was lovely to be able to stay at a place where I could be as outgoing, or as focused on schoolwork as I wanted. Jessica and Jonathan were very welcoming, and very laid-back. They made sure my stay was going well, checked to see if there was anything else I needed. I appreciated being able to use the kitchen as much as I wanted. 
For people who are more introverted, this is a great place because the house is so big. 
For those who are more social, this is a great area as well. Ravenna and the surrounding districts have so many great restaurants and activities. 
I should add that they have three very sweet dogs that love to play and cuddle. I loved having the dogs around, but for people who are not fans of animals, this is probably not the best place. 
 The dogs sometimes bark, but this was not an issue for me, even when I was working night shift and sleeping during the day. They did not wake me up either due to the fan I had on or due to sheer exhaustion. "
6759104,45751814,2015-09-05,10793054,Guillaume,"Nous avons passé 2 nuits chez Sarah et Yos-wa, c'était super !! 
Nous avions des cartes de Seattle pour nous repérer , un plan de bus, Sarah as tout fait pour que nous puissions découvrir au mieux la ville !! 
La maison est grande est accueillante , propreté parfaite ! 
"
6759104,46101034,2015-09-07,33066046,Ruby,"The place was very easy to find. The bed was comfortable and our host Sarah was really friendly and accommodating. The kitchen was well-stocked, too. "
6759104,46980726,2015-09-14,43389645,John,"The room was everything I expected.  It was cozy with a comfortable queen bed and plenty of floor space.  I could open the window to get fresh air.  Entry was easy, and the hosts were friendly.  The room is upstairs and the bathroom(s) are downstairs, and I had no problem going between them."
6759104,47806404,2015-09-21,42416583,David,"Prior to our arrival Sarah was very kind to send us local tips on eating/drinking/shopping which really helped to enhance our short Seattle stay.

Sarah's place was just as described: bed was clean/comfy, bathroom clean and well-stocked with free toiletries, kitchen had all cooking essentials with some nice freebies, and living room was full of plenty of entertainment options for relaxation.

More importantly, the location was safe and centrally located to get around Seattle.

I would definitely stay again at Sarah's place."
6759104,48575708,2015-09-27,14141689,Mani,"We appreciate the thoughtful touches at Sarah & Yos-wa's during our stay. Not only that their place is conveniently located to everything; they also provided a helpful info around town. A guest's instruction posted throughout the house was quite helpful while they are away

We walked to the International District, Uber/Lyft to downtown area and when we want to avoid the cold night air, took ferry to Bainbridge Island and left with great memories of Seattle

We enjoyed staying at their place and would recommend it to other guests
"
6759104,49652287,2015-10-05,13459862,Brady,"Best airbnb! Sarah and Yos were excellent hosts. Great home with lots of character in a quiet neighborhood just minutes from downtown and the Seahawks stadium (driving). The amenities they provided were great. The bed was super comfy too for my girlfriend and I after long days of hiking or exploring the city. Sarah and Yos were even kind enough to create a map of local favorite spots (food, drinks etc.). They were also very fun to talk to. Would stay here again anytime and would definitely recommend it!!"
6759104,50341847,2015-10-11,21067054,Chaochao,"Sarah & Yos-wa are both very nice guys. The room is pretty cozy, the queen size bed is very comfortable. The window can be opened to let in some fresh air, but might be a little bit difficult to close. The place is easy to find, however,  remember it's 24th ave S, my stupid GPS can't find 24th S. The location is pretty good, and it's close to downtown. Overall, it's a very pleasant experience to stay there.  "
6759104,51348953,2015-10-19,811039,Christina,"Sarah was very accommodating with letting us check in early so we could drop off our luggage before heading to the Seahawks game. Her home had a lot of character and I loved it! The room was very clean and I especially liked the small details of leaving us local papers to guide us around Seattle, the umbrellas should we need them, and the chocolates.  Cute place and I would stay here again!"
6759104,56005543,2015-12-07,45227868,Chris,I had a great stay in the Cozy Room. Very nice room and the bed was comfy. Sarah was a great host. She gave me lots of tips and places to visit in Seattle. Be sure to check out here awesome google map list. The house is in a nice quiet neighborhood and close to downtown. 
6759104,56453791,2015-12-13,50867904,Julie,Very comfortable place. We loved being within walking distance of Pioneer Square and downtown! Having off-street parking was also a huge relief. 
6759104,56964249,2015-12-20,28339797,Kristin And Scott,Very nice and inviting. Made us feel welcomed and provided an awesome list of recommendations that we took advantage of. Definitely recommend this space.

8152764,52123456,2015-10-26,33302196,Laurel,"Enjoyed a wonderful weekend in Seattle from the comfort of Wes & Kelsey's apartment!  This spot is IDEAL for a quick getaway.  It is within walking distance of cafes, restaurants and even Trader Joe's!  It is close to the fun Fremont area (lots of breweries) and some great running spots - Lake Union and Green Lake.  Their place is modern, clean and cozy.  I enjoyed sitting on the porch overlooking Lake Union and enjoying the city sounds and lights at night.  Both Kelsey and Wes were extremely attentive and helpful while I was staying at their place.  I would highly recommend this spot to all travelers.  "
5325214,26965540,2015-02-22,88350,Jason,Tracey's is an excellent host and our basement apartment is in a very convenient location for our dog to play in the park. I highly recommend her place for anyone looking to stay in Seattle. 
5325214,27854945,2015-03-13,24242091,Brittanie,Staying at Tracey's house was a great experience. The basement was unique and perfectly suited for a guest to stay in.
5325214,28433810,2015-03-23,28895474,Veronica,"Tracey was an incredibly warm and welcoming host. During our first night, she checked in with us (myself and two roommates) to ensure we were comfortable and brought down an extra blanket. Additionally, she provided us with awesome recommendations for having a great weekend in Seattle: farmers markets & parks galore! 

The space was impeccably clean and well insulated. It usually functions as a schooling center for young children so there are plenty of curious and uplifting decorations all around. The space is a 5-10 min walk from a key bus stop (we used the 16 frequently) and a 5 min drive from active neighborhoods with great food and quaint shops."
5325214,30218161,2015-04-19,3956778,Angie,The location was perfect and very close to everything. We had tons of privacy and nobody bothered us. Parking was very convenient and free! Great park across the street and very kid friendly area. Great for short stays.
5325214,30436061,2015-04-21,6426992,Michael,"It was efficient to communicate with Tracey to set up my last minute one night stay in Seattle for a business meeting. 

This was a charming place to stay, it is a part of a daycare facility.  The kids toys and drawings took me back to when my kids were little.  The sleeping space is a queen sized bed in a loft and there is limited head room--kind of like sleeping in a berth on a boat.  I whacked my head once in the middle of the night when I tried to sit up, but I got used to it quickly.

Nice shower with tiled floor.    Full kitchen.  Close to the zoo and Green Lake, which I walked around before dinner.  Close to the Wallingford and the UW too, which was my reason for staying here."
5325214,30730182,2015-04-26,804086,John,"Very beautiful neighborhood in Seattle. Right across the street from a park and close to Green Lake. Parking was a breeze.

I appreciated the fresh flowers and notes on the area with suggestions of things to do. The bathroom is wonderful and the bed is very cozy even though the loft space is a little small for a big person like me.

I will definitely consider this place again the next time I am in Seattle."
5325214,31820267,2015-05-10,6243529,Tianyi,Cozy and private. A great place to stay if you're traveling with your dog. The park and lake are just across the street. Tracey and her family are super cute and very respectful of your privacy. 
5325214,32258257,2015-05-16,5539816,Pablo,"This place is an absolutely wonderful choice. It is very close to downtown but with the quiet homey feel, Tracy is a lovely host, greeting us upon check in and giving us a tour of the place, as well as leaving a thoughtful note with her number and information about her neighborhood local favorites, from ice cream places to coffee. She even left a bar of Theo's chocolates, which is a Seattle local!

The kitchenette is very convenient and helpful to have food at home and store it in the mini fridge. Tracy had been sure to make the place spotless before we settled in. The loft bed can feel a bit confined but it is otherwise quite comfortable. The other bed is comfortable too. There is even a heater included for those chilly Seattle nights!

All in all, I would highly recommend this place, for the complete ease of staying here and proximity to everything you would want to do in Seattle."
5325214,51986933,2015-10-25,25066880,Jake,"Tracey was great. Very friendly when we met her and she did a great job setting up the property for the weekend. The bed is tight, but cozy. We loved that there was free parking and an exterior entrance to the property just for us."
5325214,53373539,2015-11-08,12996440,Kari,"This was perfect for our adventures around Seattle! Love the cozy loft bed and amazing shower with pebbled floor! Would be very easy to get around via bike or bus. My friend is a diva so we Ubered everywhere. I did however get her to join us for a walk to Fremont, it was a nice walk and not too far! Would definitely stay again!"
5325214,54643300,2015-11-22,1209081,Brenna,"This place was great! It was cute staying in a preschool, but worked very well doubling as an airbnb. The apartment is in a renovated basement, and while there didn't seem to be like duct heating, Tracy turned on the space heater before we arrived so that it warmed up, and her husband came down to say hi and give us an extra key. The shower is awesome, and while the bed area is kind of difficult to navigate (short people will do better here) it was novel and perfectly functional for a few days. Greenlake is a great area with lots of restaurants and coffee shops, and bussing into downtown Seattle only took 20-30 minutes (and there are lots of busses nearby). I'd definitely stay here again if looking for a place in Seattle for a few nights!"
5325214,55263808,2015-11-29,8836356,John,"Had an excellent stay; very nice, cozy place."
5325214,55858710,2015-12-06,17170435,Hilary,This apartment was fantastic and in a great location; exactly what my friend and I needed for a wonderful weekend in Seattle! 
5325214,56401600,2015-12-13,31627775,Erin,"This basement space was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. It's in green lake so there's plenty of free street parking unlike some other areas of the city. It's nice to have a little kitchen in case you decide to eat in, like we did one night. Can't wait to come back and visit. "
1023693,6255871,2013-08-05,7627536,Diane,"Shannon was an absolute dream to rent from.  She outfitted the apartment with all kinds of personal touches to make us feel so welcomed and comfortable.  From great pre-trip communication to the hand-written welcome card, to the lovely selection of vintage records and games, to the extremely comfortable, luxurious bed, to inviting us spontaneously to enjoy the backyard on a particularly warm evening, to all the really great local recommendations, directions, maps, contact info that she meticulously arranged....to to to....there is too much to mention!  She made our first trip to Seattle completely wonderful.  Next time we visit that beautiful city, we will hope to be able to stay in her awesomely inspiring space.  Thanks so much Shannon and happy trails until we meet again!"
1023693,6351918,2013-08-09,4487287,Carol,"Staying at Shannon's apartment in Ballard was such a treat! We were looking for something outside downtown Seattle, but located conveniently enough so that we could easily get there via public transit. Luckily, her rental is location just a few blocks from the Rapid D Line which takes you straight downtown. However, once we realized how much there was to do in Ballard, we opted to spend a few days just checking out the area and going to the beach at Golden Gardens Park. 

From the beginning of our stay, Shannon was very inviting and very accommodating with our check-in time. She showed great compassion for us when our next AirBnB accommodations fell through and had no problem extending our current reservation without a hassle. Her willingness to help  made us feel very comfortable with our choice, and that we were well taken care of.

Her lower-level apartment was very cute! She supplied everything from coffee and tea  to cotton swabs and disposable razors. She even had reusable shopping bags for your groceries! Were impressed with the minimalist, yet eclectic, style of the suite, and how it had everything you needed without having too much. The bed was incredibly comfortable and clean. The shower head was also a nice treat! There is so much more we could rave about but it's pretty self-explanatory in the pictures!

If you're looking for an entire apartment (that is intended as a rental and not someone's actual residence) in a great neighbourhood within walking distance to bus lines and amazing restaurants, this is the place for you. It doesn't feel like a basement suite because there are  full sized windows in the living area. We also felt very safe parking, and leaving, our car on the streets. I definitely recommend Shannon as a host and hope to stay here again for our next trip to Seattle! Thanks, Shannon!

1023693,6402321,2013-08-11,1212355,Raquel,"Shannon's place was AWESOME! She went above and beyond her duties as a host and provided an immaculate, beautiful, and cozy space,  as well as a prepared suggestion list of places to visit during our stay. The location was excellent, walking distance to some very cool restaurants, and close to a handful of local breweries. Shannon was attentive, detail oriented, and thoughtful-I strongly recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks for everything, Shannon!"
1023693,6451979,2013-08-12,7787830,Joyce,Shannon was an unbelievable host.  She was able to accommodate us last minute and communication was fantastic.  Checking in and getting to the apartment was easy.  We LOVE the Ballard neighborhood and the apt is just amazing! Even though it states basement it's really a first floor walk-up apt that gets a ton of light!  A must stay!
1023693,6539269,2013-08-16,7605348,Andrea,"We stayed in Shannon's place in mid-August and had a wonderful stay. The place was a nice mix of artsy and elegant, equipped with all the amenities you need. The kitchen was beautifully decorated with gorgeous wood countertops and vintage designs. The bed was comfortable and had the softest sheets I've ever slept in. Shannon brought over fresh flowers from Ballard market when we arrived which made the house smell lovely throughout our stay. Shannon was a wonderful host, keeping us abreast of happenings in the neighborhood and gave us amazing recommendations for food options in the area.  Her place is an absolute gem. We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in Seattle. "
1023693,6575838,2013-08-17,373340,Casey,"Shannon's place was fantastic.  It was very well-outfitted with all the amenities, and the bed was amazing.  All the logistics were incredibly easy.  I look forward to staying again in the future."
1023693,6747822,2013-08-23,8257539,Norah,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Shannon's apartment for a night, picking it for its proximity to the restaurants in Ballard. We had such a great stay! The space is cozy chic with so many charming touches and attention to detail. The bedroom was lovely and quiet and made for great sleeping. The kitchen was fabulous (we even took pics for our own kitchen remodeling). And yes, it does get nice light for a basement apartment. 

When traveling, I much prefer to have a space that feels like home rather than be in a hotel, and Shannon's place felt very comfortable and easy to spend time in. My only wish was that we could stay for more than one night! I'll definitely book the space again when I return to Seattle. "
1023693,6786760,2013-08-25,6592829,Hildy,"We had a great time staying at this roomy apartment! Shannon was wonderful and even popped out, from upstairs, when we pulled up to the place to give us the keys. She even gave us a picnic basket & blanket to take to our concert at the zoo. So accomadating!
We wish we would've stayed longer and joked that we could take this apt back to Idaho with us. 
Thanks again Shannon!"
1023693,6875756,2013-08-28,7918458,Alexis,"Shannon's apartment was such a pleasure to stay in and she is sweet and accommodating to boot!  Everything we needed was provided plus a few flourishes that she went out of her way to provide, like some snacks and recommendations.  The apartment was spotless and totally functional when we felt like lazing around after a long day of walking - the record player and equipped kitchen were put to good use!  I will definitely be recommending this apartment to friends who are looking to stay in Ballard."
1023693,6972035,2013-09-01,3890974,Prairie,"My stay at Shannon's cozy, Ballard apartment couldn't have been better! The place is much more spacious than I had expected and filled with all kinds of amenities. From the freshly picked plums and flowers from the backyard to the lush towels, assorted teas and slippers left in the bedroom, I was reminded why an AirBNB experience can be so much more superior to a regular, old hotel stay. While the apartment was sparkling clean, streamlined and airy with a mid-century modern vibe, the touches were so personal and thoughtful. I never wanted to leave! And that rain shower nozzle in the bathroom REALLY sealed the deal. I can't wait to plan my next visit to Seattle! "
1023693,6988566,2013-09-02,7596341,Kendall,"Shannon's Ballard apartment was perfect for a weekend stay in Seattle.  Impeccably clean, beautifully decorated and in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to Ballard's bars, restaurants, etc. (and a quick drive to downtown Seattle).  The bed was beyond comfortable - couldn't help but sleep late!  We were 100% pleased with our stay.   "
1023693,7045634,2013-09-04,8052253,Skye,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Shannon's super cute apartment! It was so much bigger than we expected and there were so many amenities! We were only there a day but wished we had longer. We played board games, listened to the records she had, looked through magazines, and had a peaceful sleep. The kitchen was super outfitted, we were sad we didn't have any cooking to do to be able to use all the cool stuff! 
Shannon was super communicative and friendly, and met us there to give us the keys, accommodating the tight schedule we had for getting to a wedding. The location was great for us as we mainly wanted to hang out in Ballard and the lakes and wanted a cute neighborhood feel as opposed to staying downtown.
We would definitely stay here again in the future!"
1023693,7101057,2013-09-06,8130325,Darrah,"Shannon's place was clean, spacious and very comfortable. She provides all the little things the traveler might expect from a hotel (a closet with clothes hangers, extra towels, hairdryer, etc), plus lifestyle touches such as a turntable and records, books and maps, nice coffee and tea and even organic milk to put in it! Plus a thoughtfully appointed kitchen. There is nothing more we could have asked for.

The neighborhood is a lovely one and it's a short walk from a good bakery for morning pastry. Shannon left a nice guide to the local spots.  

Shannon was quick to respond and reach out to coordinate check-in/check out, which happened effortlessly. We have nothing but praise for Shannon and her MIL Apartment! 
"
1023693,7161196,2013-09-09,7522465,Cara,We had an amazing stay at Shannon's place! It's the perfect size for 2. Clean and cute! Thanks for being so accommodating! We'll be back!
1023693,7230257,2013-09-11,7310742,Barbara,"We had a nice and relaxing stay in the apartment which was bigger than we expected. The place was clean and did not lack anything. I was impressed by the beautiful kitchen, but unfortunately, our short stay and the available great restaurants in close proximity did not allow for doing any cooking in it.

The apartment is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with good connections to Downtown and University District. The heart of Ballard is only a walking distance away.

Shannon was a friendly and helpful host. Upon inquiry she arrange that we can check in prior to the listed check in time, which made our transfer from one accommodation to the other so much easier."
1023693,7365755,2013-09-17,5372607,Lucy,"We didn't interact much with Shannon as she was not in town during our stay but she was lovely when we she handed us the keys and explained everything perfectly. The apartment was nice and quaint and in a cute little neighborhood, the kitchen was lovely but we were gone most of the day so we didn't actually cook there. The bed was super comfy though, probably the best part of our whole stay! "
1023693,7440555,2013-09-20,5440666,David,"Shannon was a perfect host.  Even though we never met her personally, she made certain that everything was in perfect order.  We never lacked for anything and found her renovated basement apartment to be the coziest and most inviting place we've ever stayed.  The surrounding neighborhood is exceptionally quiet and we always found a parking space right out front.  I can't recommend this apartment enough.  We had such a great stay!"
1023693,7498184,2013-09-22,8873950,Kirsten,"I absolutely adore Shannon's space!  My husband and I stayed for two nights on our trip to Seattle.  The apartment is cosy, bright, and welcoming. I loved the balance of a clean, minimalist aesthetic with warm vintage touches.  Simple, not overdone.  The record player and board games made for an old-time-y evening.  Her little amenities really make the whole experience - plush towels, amazing bedding, rain shower head, tea & coffee and a kitchen I wanted to take home with me!

Shannon was easy to communicate with.  She was there to greet us when we arrived.  She was flexible and even texted to offer us a later checkout when the next guests were arriving later.  Such a nice, thoughtful person.  I highly recommend staying with Shannon.  I hope we'll be back!"
1023693,7555482,2013-09-24,7364358,Damon,"Staying at Shannon's place was a delight. She accommodated our late check-in, was indispensable as a local resource and responded  immediately to any of our messages. We were floored upon our arrival: the space is incredible and the details matter. We found refreshments in the fridge and jazz on the radio. What a treat. Our only regret was not saving enough time to meet her in person. We'll be back. "
1023693,7699470,2013-09-30,434371,Jeffrey (And Hannah),"This was a great place to stay during our short trip to Seattle! It was very quiet and even though it is a converted (above-ground) basement, it had plenty of light throughout. Shannon was very communicative and has all sorts of little goodies to make your stay awesome. Oh...... and the bed is one of the most comfortable beds that I've ever slept in! "
1023693,7814284,2013-10-04,7448809,Kirk,"I loved Shannon's place! It was bigger than I expected and extremely comfortable. Two people would probably enjoy it even more because they'd have plenty of space to spread out and listen to music or cook.

I only saw Shannon briefly but she was helpful with my late arrival and messages throughout my stay to make sure I had everything and was comfortable.

I highly recommend staying here!
"
1023693,7921384,2013-10-08,7799813,Sheila,"Shannon's place was perfect for me - private, quiet, centrally located to where I was going, spacious, comfortable, very clean, and well-appointed.  There is no TV (I don't watch anyhow), and even with gorgeous weather like I got, you are likely to need the wall heaters with the chilly floors (but chenille socks provided!).  Lots of closet space and hangers, modern appliances in kitchen, thoughtful touches like maps, blow-dryer, guidebooks and restaurant suggestions (plus Pellegrino, coffee and candies!).  Highly recommended!"
1023693,8178087,2013-10-19,9283923,Sean,"I'm sad that this is my first Airbnb experience because nothing else will top this.  It's the perfect place, perfectly cozy, perfectly quiet, WARM, and with the perfect host. The location was outstanding, with easy access to everything we wanted to do in Seattle and the East Side.
Details: Bed was perfect with nice, new, warm coverings. Kitchen had everything we could have wanted and it made me want to stay longer so we could find something to cook. Bathroom was fully appointed with dozens of fresh towels. The living area was extra comfortable and we used the record player almost non-stop. Even though it's a basement apartment, it's full of light and is very easy to keep warm.
We can't say enough about our host - she was friendly and communicative while being extremely professional. Her care and taste in appointing the rooms was evident.

In short - I wish we could keep this little secret to ourselves, but everybody deserves to stay here!"
1023693,8345894,2013-10-27,8141468,Brenna,"Loved Washington, loved Ballard, loved the apartment! Seriously if anyone is reading through these comments and deciding to choose or not choose this apartment.... Go with this one. 

Shannon was so sweet on arrival, quick tour and left the keys with us. We were in Seattle getting married- she left a bottle of champagne for us with a cute little note.  Thank you for that, Shannon! 

For a basement apartment- it does not feel like one at all. Roomy with lots of light and a very simple and tasteful decor makes it feel welcoming. Fairly easy to find, located in a quiet neighborhood and a maybe 10 minute drive from downtown Seattle. 

The bed is amazing! I had to ask Shannon where she got the sheets because I need those at home. 
I loved the variety of teas, the little footies, and that coffee maker. 
We are already planning of when we can come back. (:"
1023693,8485518,2013-11-02,7448809,Kirk,"I had another great stay at Shannon's apartment. She left a nice note thanking me for the return visit and thought I might enjoy reading one of her architecture/design books during my stay, which I did. It was directly relevant to the house my wife and I are building. Very thoughtful!

Again, I would recommend Shannon's place to anyone.
"
1023693,8527716,2013-11-04,9109832,Lauren,"My husband and I needed a place to stay for our friends' wedding and Shannon's place was not only in the perfect location, but was the right price and extremely comfortable to stay in. She accommodated our requests to check-in early and check-out late as I was in a wedding party and needed some flexibility. She was extremely sweet and showed us the apartment and how to use an awesome coffee percolator (makes such delicious, rich coffee!!). The apartment is awesome, even our friends who live in Ballard stopped by to see it and knew we'd found a gem! We'll definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to our friends if they have family or friends visiting from out of town that want a genuine Seattle experience. Thank you, Shannon!!"
1023693,8628360,2013-11-09,2349113,Kira,"Shannon's place is great! We loved her apartment and the Ballard neighborhood. We were close enough to walk to places like the Fat Hen for breakfast and the Urban Market for a sandwich/take out (yum!!). The bus to downtown is a breeze, super convenient. Overall, Shannon's place was pretty much perfect! We were there in November when Seattle is a little chilly and with the heaters we were perfectly comfortable in the downstairs apartment. As others said you get plenty of light in there too. Shannon is so thoughtful, not a detail missed and we appreciated the truffles and socks!  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for a week in Seattle…highly recommended!! "
1023693,8688838,2013-11-12,8989184,Laura,"This place was perfect!  Shannon made sure we had everything we needed, down to fancy organic cream for our coffee.  The bed was almost too comfortable, and she had plenty of games, books and records stashed here and there for the (common) cold and rainy day.  She even surprised us with a bottle of prosecco to help me celebrate my birthday!  We can't wait to come back and stay longer."
1023693,8729538,2013-11-14,2872711,Daniel,"shannon's place was perfect for us. the apartment was well stocked, clean, and the bed was excessively comfortable. key exchange was effortless, communication was great. i'd recommend to anyone, anytime."
1023693,8760035,2013-11-16,369939,Jonah,"Shannon was a gracious, considerate, and generous host. Apartment is cozy and extremely clean. The kitchen is well appointed; bathroom's nice and stocked with fresh towels, q-tips, Kleenex, etc.; bedroom was furnished with a soft rug, large closet, and big soft bed next to a window facing the lovely front garden. The unit got *pretty* good light for being partially below-ground. Nice details throughout, on a quiet, pretty block with tons of available street parking. Would definitely stay again.  "
1023693,8817439,2013-11-19,15477,Kirby,"Shannon's place is absolutely adorable. It's like having your own little apartment in Seattle- quaint kitchen and all. Shannon was SO helpful when it came to suggestions for restaurants, venues, and places to shop. Check in and check out was simple. The apartment is a 20 minute walk from the main Ballard strip with a ton of great restaurants! I recommend staying here for part if not all of your stay!
"
1023693,8965645,2013-11-28,3618800,Annabeth,Super cozy sheets & nice decor.  The brief stay was very enjoyable and Shannon was prompt with a last minute request!  Thank you!
1023693,9068479,2013-12-04,2863281,Myahn,"We had a fantastic time in Seattle over the holiday. The adorable little apartment we rented from Shannon was perfect: private, quiet, clean, and modern. Everything was in order and a plenty (towels, dishes, etc.) and the little details were just superb, right down to the slipper socks and the assortment of herbal teas. It was like the space was custom outfitted just for us (ginger chews and wasabi peas? our faves!). The location was great for quick trips into downtown or the nearby Fremont and Queen Anne neighborhoods, and we enjoyed ourselves just as much staying in a couple of nights to play games and records (the soundtrack to Vision Quest rules!) and cuddle in the big comfy bed. Thanks for helping to make our stay in the Emerald City truly wonderful. "
1023693,9160450,2013-12-10,3169620,Rebecca,"This cozy little apartment is just as described, we had a lovely stay there during a freezing weekend in December and managed to stay quite warm and comfortable.  Great neighborhood, very quiet but accessible to lots of great restaurants and shops nearby.  Shannon provides lots of extras in the apartment, like records, great tea and coffee, truffles, extra cozy bedding, and fuzzy socks. It was a great stay and I highly recommend this airbnb!"
1023693,9214350,2013-12-14,1652380,Leah,"A great place in a great neighborhood. Shannon took care with certain details in her place (coffee, decoration) and it really made the stay better than nice. Definitely would stay here again if I return to Seattle! "
1023693,9370394,2013-12-24,7675604,Maria,"My husband and I visited Seattle for a few days before Christmas and we had a great time at Shannon's suite.  It was absolutely perfect. The place was super clean, cozy and stocked with everything you would need in order to have a great stay.  I especially loved that there was no t.v. but lots of games to play. 
Ballard is an awesome area, lots of great places to eat, shop and just peruse in general. Everything was so close, ample parking and I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a unique place to visit in Seattle.  Thank you Shannon!"
1023693,9490155,2013-12-31,9316179,Anne,I didn't stay here;  my daughter did when she visited from CA with her two teenagers.   She loved it.  It was cozy and quiet and most comfortable.   A haven for her.
1023693,9550945,2014-01-02,10043216,John,"What a great stay. Shannon made it super easy to coordinate and made us feel right at home. The place was clean and cozy, with some goodies set out for us; even a bottle of champagne in the fridge for New Year's! We had a wonderful time staying there and it was so close to the bus lines for easy travel. I would recommend this place again and again."
1023693,9821044,2014-01-12,5419530,Shawn,Shannon's place is honestly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at.  I have used Airbnb several times when I travel for work and this was by far the most comfortable and accommodating. I will try and stay here every visit to Seattle!  Thanks Shannon!
1023693,10094397,2014-01-30,3190593,Jim,"Shannon & her apartment were great.  The apartment was spacious, stylish and immaculate.  Shannon left treats that were appreciated, and check-in & check-out were smooth."
1023693,10347352,2014-02-15,7448809,Kirk,"It was my third stay at Shannon's place and I plan to stay there again on future work trips. It is super comfortable, big, in a nice neighborhood, etc. All the positive reviews people give the place are true. Highly recommended."
1023693,10416768,2014-02-18,4058063,Sherri Lynn,"Shannon""s place is awesome, we didn't want to leave. Great location, great amenities, completely private. As others have said, it is the little touches Shannon leaves for her guests that make the experience so wonderful.  Also try the High Life restaurant for brunch or dinner- ask for Travis he is a great waiter. Very enjoyable experience."
1023693,10617258,2014-02-28,3178456,Steven,"This was my second stay with Shannon; I came bqck for the ease, central location, comfort, convenience and the great entertainment available in the (website hidden). all the classic books you've wanted to read but might not have gotten too yet, and while you're perusing them, you can nibble on the chocolate bonbons or ginger chews (best variety) that Shannon provides and there is a book of drawing challenges so you can leave a sample of your artistic aspiration there. Finally, when you have to sleep, the silky soft sheets will tempt you to float away...way past your wake up call. So, even if you have nothing special to do in Ballard, you can do something special staying right here. Try it and you'll be surprised when you receive your receipt after your stay-HA! Mystery treat."
1023693,10719022,2014-03-04,3178456,Steven,"My second visit to Shannon's revealed to me the most beautiful Camellia in Ballard, right out back! And Shannon is an active neighborhood gardener, a responsive, accommodating hostess who offers an ideal, quiet spot central to everything in Ballard. She offered to send me something I inadvertently left behind and diligently looked for something I thought I left behind but ultimately found I didn't. Very pleasant experience with Shannon both times I stayed there and if and when the occasion arises again to stay in the area, I'll know where to look for ease, comfort, convenience, cost-effective, cozy, clean, quiet digs. You should try it too!"
1023693,11064934,2014-03-18,8925916,Suzy,"We loved Shannon's space! She made the small place very comfortable and clean. For those looking to stay in, Shannon's apartment has a record player and endless games; perfect for a rainy evening. Ballard is a quaint and friendly community with many small bistros and cafes serving local fare. Parking was easy and Shannon was very accommodating."
1023693,11223312,2014-03-25,12432290,Stephanie,"Staying at Shannon's was lovely! The place was just as described and show in the photos, and actually even larger than I thought. It was conveniently located by the bus stop downtown, as well as a lot of cute bars and restaurants. She also provided extra goodies for us: prosseco, candies and coffee which was unexpected and a nice treat. The bed was heavenly, so comfortable, I slept great!  It was slightly chilly, but she made up for that with cozy socks, bathrobes and there are small heaters in the space that would warm up nicely. I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting the area. "
1023693,11360088,2014-03-31,12655166,Marlene,"Host was congenial and welcoming.  Space was everything promised and more.  Tastefully and cleverly furnished and decorated.  Very, very comfortable.  The combination of retro and current was charming."
1023693,11590775,2014-04-08,10422766,Amanda,This place was perfect!  My fiance and I stayed for 5 nights at Shannon's place in Ballard.  The space is comfortable and super nice.  She has everything you could possibly want or need for you in the apartment.  This was my first airbnb experience and I was extremely pleased.  We also enjoyed that it was a change of for us pace (instead of a boring hotel) and we felt like we really were part of the neighborhood by staying here.  Ballard is a great community; we were able to walk to pretty much anything we wanted and we could be in downtown in about 30 minutes by bus.  I would highly recommend Shannon's place! 
1023693,11723248,2014-04-13,2855024,Kristi,"Super clean and unique apartment with a very comfortable bed.  Shannon was very helpful, and we would love to stay here again sometime.  "
1023693,12062938,2014-04-22,5775518,Lisa,"Working with Shannon was so easy! She was very friendly and easy to get hold of. Her apartment was perfectly furnished and the bed was the most comfortable bed we've slept in while traveling. The shower was great, too! 
I made coffee with the provided percolator and fresh ground beans. I know I was in Seattle, but it was SERIOUSLY the best coffee I've ever had. Enjoying a cup on the comfy couch in the plush robe was a highlight of my trip. Very cozy and comfortable place to stay."
1023693,12405709,2014-05-01,5118936,Sue,We had a wonderful stay at Shannon's place.  Quiet and cozy.  Everything you could possibly need (except a microwave and TV as stated - which was fine by us!).  Nice location. Daily hikes around Green lake. Gracious hostess.  We'll be back!
1023693,12848690,2014-05-12,14564387,Alissa,"Shannon was a wonderful host! We had a great stay in Seattle and got engaged while we were there! She had a very comfortable, updated and clean apartment in a great location with things easily accessible. She was able to accommodate us on an early check in when our plane arrived early in the day which was very appreciated and let us use her umbrella when it rained. Thanks Shannon for a great stay in Seattle!!
"
1023693,13038865,2014-05-18,14061939,Sam,"Shannon was a great host! The apartment was clean, homey, and centrally located. The bed was super comfortable, and the amenities were exactly what we were looking for. Shannon was quick and responsive to our requests and I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
1023693,13163545,2014-05-20,5680874,Annie,"Great location! Great apartment! Super clean and has everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. The bed was extremely comfortable!

Shannon was easy to reach, very friendly and quick to respond. We loved the neighbourhood. Quiet but close to a series of neat little restaurants. I would highly recommend this place to anyone I know. Thanks, Shannon!"
1023693,13229887,2014-05-22,10706060,Pete,"Our stay was ok. Plenty of towels. Place was furnished tastefully. Concrete floors can be a problem in the winter but she makes up for it with socks.. Slippers will be a good idea.. Ballard is an retro funky neighborhood. Most of the unit rentals will be basements, so be cautious cuz they may be moldy..  "
1023693,13421590,2014-05-27,4341098,Deana,"Shannon was such a gracious host. The place was exactly as advertised and super cozy. Everything was clean and Shannon thought of every detail in terms of what a guest may need. Very convenient to several restaurants and a really great breakfast place (the fat hen). We loved staying in the neighborhood! Easy parking for those who rented cars. Great morning coffee, fun records to play while getting ready and lots of games for those rainy nights (if that's your thing). Thanks Shannon!!"
1023693,13738033,2014-06-03,8180010,Amanda,This was our favorite traveling experience with Airbnb yet. We absolutely loved Shannon's well appointed apartment. We spent most of our time there marveling at what a superb job she has done decorating and anticipating a guest's every need. It was in a lovely quiet neighborhood and close to our family - we will definitely be back if she will have us! 
1023693,13961865,2014-06-09,13423080,Neika,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I couldn't imagine using anything else now! Shannon was an absolutely wonderful host. Her place was just as advertised if not even better and included all of the amenities we could have ever wished for on our stay. The fridge was stocked with a nice bottle of wine, fresh milk, sparkling water, and coconut water and the house was located in a super cute neighborhood which was walking distance to some of the best restaurants (Delancy, Fat Hen) I've been to in a while. 
We were in Seattle for a friends wedding and there was always an Uber car less than 5 minutes away and downtown was no more than 10 minutes away.
Shannon was even sweet enough to let us check out at 5pm since our flight was not until 8pm that day which was very sweet of her. 
We would definitely recommend her place to anyone in the Seattle area and hope to return soon!"
1023693,14169966,2014-06-13,4413607,Taylor,"Shannon's apartment was great.  Her description of the unit was spot on.  I didn't use much of anything except for the bed, heat, and the shower (great pressure, one of the best showers I've ever experienced).  But the place was everything you could ask for if you plan to be out and about in Seattle and need a very comfortable place to relax afterward.

Shannon was great upon check-in and check-out and offered some great suggestions on Seattle."
1023693,14475668,2014-06-20,587513,Susan,"Shannon was great. Very easy to work with.  My parents stayed in her MIL apt. when they visited me.  She is only a few blocks from my home. Her apartment was lovely. Very nicely appointed and spacious. My parents have stayed in several other places when visiting me and this was their best experience. Ideally located in Seattle. Close to bus lines, convenient to downtown, many good restaurant choices within walking distance and very quiet and safe neighborhood.  I highly recommend staying with Shannon. I will definitely reserve her place the next time my family visits."
1023693,14731747,2014-06-25,13326750,Samantha,"Shannon was a wonderful host.  She was easy to contact and very accommodating.  She even let my boyfriend drop off all of his things before the check-in time. Everything you could ever need was supplied in the apartment and there wasn't anything superfluous, which I loved.  She even supplied us with a coffee grinder when we asked and let us hang out in the backyard on the day we checked out while we waited for our taxi.  The apartment is in a great location.  If you don't mind walking you can walk to downtown Ballard, but there are also plenty of other great things within walking distance.  Her recommendations for restaurants in the area were wonderful.  We went to 3 that were on her list and all of them exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle."
1023693,14843548,2014-06-27,2266051,Karen,"Shannon was the perfect host. Her attention to detail is reflected in every aspect of her lovely Ballard apartment. The bed linens were soft and luxurious and the bed so comfortable.  The kitchen was well-stocked with various blends of teas and a Bialetti coffee pot and coffee made me feel at home!  The neighborhood was safe, quiet and is in close proximity to both Green Lake and Ballard.  Next time I am in Seattle, I will definitely stay here again.  Thank you, Shannon!  "
1023693,14915139,2014-06-29,15513210,Stephanie,"Shannon greeted us and filled us in about the nuances of her quaint, clean place.  Her suggestions were not only spot on, but very helpful.  She helped us navigate a new route to the airport as there was construction issues that we wouldn't have known about if she hadn't helped us.  We highly recommend the stay at Shannon's in Ballard.   It was everything as advertised and more!  Who knew we would get such a kick out of listening to her albums...everything from Dave Brubeck to the ""Vision Quest"" soundtrack!  Lot's of things like that made it a memory rather than just a place to stay."
1023693,15261816,2014-07-06,5898186,Holly,"We loved Shannon's place and what she has done with it! It was so quiet and the bed is super comfortable, I think we got some of the best sleep we've had in a long time.  We loved all of the little nice touches as well including chocolates and coffee, robes and lots of clean towels.  The location is great (we did have a car to get around) on a quiet street in Ballard and close to Phinney Ridge.  Lots of great restaurants and coffee nearby! We had booked a hotel for the last few nights of our trip but wish we had just stayed at Shannon's place the entire time.  Shannon was extremely nice and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again!"
1023693,15523812,2014-07-11,2278524,Diane,"Everything was as expected.  Shannon made getting the keys easy and was very pleasant and welcoming.  The apartment was very clean and Shannon has thought of just about everything.  Plenty of good quality towels, kitchen well equipped, etc.  The bed is a good one and cozy as the listing says. I loved the robe and comfy socks.  My daughter lives in the neighborhood which is why I was there.  It's safe and pleasant to be in.  
Unfortunately Seattle is damp even in the summer.  Or perhaps it was that this is a basement apartment so that paper bags couldn't retain crispness. On the other hand the place remained cool despite temperatures in the mid 80's.  Also despite being a basement apartment it gets the sun in summer.

My only problem was with the concrete floors.  They detract from the apartment making it cold looking.  They are unpleasant to walk on.  At the very least I think they should be painted.  Thankfully the bathroom had linoleum tile.
"
1023693,15750642,2014-07-15,8565999,Courtney,"Shannon's place was super!  We were up for a wedding in the Ballard area and wanted to stay near by.  Shannon's place was just perfect!  Decorated so nicely and such a great location!  We walked to The Fat Hen for breakfast one morning and then grabbed a bus to downtown Ballard (just a 5 minute ride).  We had a rental car as well which was handy for other city exploring, but there's plenty on foot or a quick bus ride from Shannon's too.  She was also great to communicate with, and always responded quickly!"
1023693,16017361,2014-07-20,15392880,Julie,We so enjoyed staying at Shannon's airbnb she is a class act and goes beyond to make guests feel comfortable and the space is cozy hip and equipped with everything we needed! I will look forward to staying there again!
1023693,16203883,2014-07-23,1890974,Kayla,"Echoing all the other reviews -- Shannon's place was absolutely charming! We were coming off a long weekend racing and couldn't have picked a better spot to unwind and relax! The apartment was just perfect - quiet, well appointed (I did not want to leave!) and well situated -  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! The neighborhood is cute and is centrally located to great eats/drinks. We had a car, but had we not been coordinating with folks all over town, we wouldn't have needed it - much is accessible on foot, and the bus is super close for getting downtown. Shannon was incredibly flexible (our check in time kept changing) and very responsive. "
1023693,16553102,2014-07-29,16088481,Megan,"This apartment was bright, fun and filled with so many unexpected amenities. It was beyond my expectations in both convenience and comfort.  "
1023693,16706660,2014-08-01,13873268,Jole,"Staying at Shannon's place was great. We felt very comfortable and safe there. Since we had a car, it was good for us to stay a little out of the center of town but in an area with easy access to everything we wanted to see. We also enjoyed checking out Ballard and other surrounding neighborhoods. We also appreciated that parking was easy.

Shannon's place was very clean. The decor is cute and hip. The kitchen was especially well stocked with plenty of dishes and all the coffee we could drink (which is quite a bit)! 

Shannon was helpful and friendly. She left some useful lists of restaurants and other things to check out in the local area. "
1023693,16894277,2014-08-04,15793593,Jenny,"Shannon's place was beautiful! Every little detail was amazing! There were so many conveniences there that made my stay so much easier. To the little snacks she left on the adorable kitchen table, to the little jar of bathroom products which came in handy because i forgot my shampoo! 
The feel of the place was warm and welcoming. She also had a helpful list of numbers and local bars and restaurants which came in handy when we went out for a drink. Would definitely recommend! If i was staying in Ballard again i would stay here for sure!! Thanks for being an awesome host! "
1023693,17276984,2014-08-10,12241726,Mary Beth,"Shannon was an excellent host. Everything was as described and she was on point in providing materials with details on transportation and other areas of interest. I can only resonate with everyone else about the place!  It was in a great location and a nice quiet neighborhood. The interior was tastefully decorated, clean and organized. The bed was very comfortable.  Public transportation was very accessible and conveniently located just blocks away. Everything went very smoothly from start to finish.  I would highly recommend staying with Shannon on a visit to Seattle."
1023693,17626122,2014-08-15,10858860,Lizzie,"The place is exactly as advertised. It is cozy, welcoming and very clean. There were little touches in the apartment that made our stay really pleasant. Shannon's recommendations for the neighborhood were spot on. The main drag is about a 15 minute walk away, but there are some hidden gems a few minutes away. Shannon was easy to communicate with. She made the process easy. We'd stay here again."
1023693,18414306,2014-08-26,12250863,Nick,This was the trip of a lifetime!  Shannon was an excellent host and the amenities were perfect for my travel plans.  Next time I am in Seattle I will totally return!
1023693,18628543,2014-08-29,10331180,Stephanie,"The Cozy Hip Vintage MIL is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Seattle.  Watch out!  The bed is dangerous because it is so comfy.  give yourself at least one morning to sleep in or stay in bed reading.  Shannon was easy to work with for checking in, she answered questions quickly and provided many little touches that made make this apartment cute.  "
1023693,18790858,2014-09-01,6528001,Joshua,"Shannon contacted me the night before to confirm our arrival time. We got there, and she showed us the place and gave us some ideas of where we could go for food and sightseeing. It was a very smooth process and pleasant experience. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying there. Cozy thick socks were a plus, and we definitely took advantage of her sweet collection of vinyls! The electricity did go out briefly one night (rarely happens), and even though it didn't affect us at all (we were out) she was apologetic and kept us updated on when it did come back which was much appreciated. Overall, highly recommended host and place for your next AirBnb destination. :)"
1023693,19251293,2014-09-08,6927488,Justin,"Shannon was a great host, and her MIL apartment in Ballard was the perfect fit. A quite part of a great neighborhood, a great apartment with more space than I thought there would be, and an accommodating host that made sure I had everything I needed."
1023693,19429761,2014-09-12,2479220,Kevin,"The Cozy Hip apartment was a great place to stay.  Location worked well for my work, and Shannon has the apartment nicely appointed.  The check-in was easy, and the bed, as others have said, is very comfortable.  Thank you, Shannon!"
1023693,19606149,2014-09-15,3609250,Donna,"Shannon communicated with a phone call shortly after our arrival and after that it was easy to communicate via text. The apartment was lovely and matched the description to a ""t"". The accommodations were very comfortable and we appreciated all the extra little touches: comfortable bathrobes and warm socks, fluffy towels, candies on the kitchen table. The bed is amazingly comfortable, equal to any in a good hotel. We love the Ballard neighborhood and it was very convenient for us near the relatives we were visiting on Phinney Ridge."
1023693,19925293,2014-09-21,12135157,Scott,"We loved our stay at Shannon's adorable MIL apartment!  We arrived about an hour earlier than we had predicted, and Shannon was super accommodating!  She even suggested a great spot to grab a cocktail while she finished up.  We loved the unit when we got in - pictures don't do it justice!  She has done an incredible job making the space feel cozy and personal.  The furnishings are perfect - everything you need to get by, but not too many distractions to keep you from exploring the awesome neighborhood.  Shannon's recommendations for dining, shopping, and sightseeing were super helpful for the days where we were short on plans.  The location is also very central, everything in the city we wanted to see was no more than a 15-20 minute drive (public transport seemed to be close by as well!), though Ballard, Fremont, and Phinney Ridge have so much going on you might not make it downtown!  The apartment was also fully stocked with fresh towels, clean dishes, bathrobes, and even a candy dish!  All the accoutrements of a 5-star hotel but without the sterility.  Shannon was a perfect host, very communicative, and very helpful.  Honestly a model Airbnb experience.  Will most definitely be back!  Thank you Shannon!!!!"
1023693,20344934,2014-09-28,18257399,Sarah,"Shannon was great, and very easily reachable! ... We had an excellent time in this lovely little neighborhood in Seattle. I would highly recommend her for traveling, and would certainly stay with her again!"
1023693,21162649,2014-10-12,1101582,Greg,"Shannon welcomed us when we arrived, gave us a tour of the apartment, and then let us do our thing. The apartment itself was cute, comfortable, and well-stocked with everything we needed, and the location itself was great - it was good value for money and we'd happily stay here again."
1023693,21785654,2014-10-24,21101030,Linda,"Great place to spend a few nights in Ballard. We had all we needed and more....comfy bed, towels galore, well supplied kitchen. Next time we are in town, we will book again."
1023693,22674408,2014-11-11,20903708,Alexandra,"We arrived after a bit of a rough week, so it was wonderful to just feel  cozy and relaxed from the moment we walked into the apartment. We put on a record from the collection, made ourselves a tea from the great little assortment of loose leaf teas, and loved exploring the ""vintage hip"" deco and all the thoughtful little touches Shannon has added to the place. It's a super cute, joyful apartment with everything you could need. Everything is in perfect shape and done beautifully. It feels warm and personal, but at the same time like an upscale boutique hotel (where you get a full kitchen plus a cozy living room on top, for a price that's a steal). Shannon is a kind and caring host with a great eye for detail. 
The neighbourhood was perfect for us; it's a sweet, relaxed residential area, and the bonus is that you have some of Seattle's best eats within a couple blocks (5 min max) walking distance. Delancey's for incredible wood-fired pizza, Essex for crafty cocktails and small plates, Honore Artisan Bakery and The Fat Hen for brunch/lunch are all really excellent. Loved the Phinney Ridge/Ballard neighborhoods in general, and the drive to downtown is really short.
Overall, highly recommend and we'll definitely be back!"
1023693,22907120,2014-11-17,5610197,Holly,"We wanted a fun place to spend a mother daughter weekend, and this was the perfect find! We had a blast sightseeing during the day and then knowing we had such a soft place to land made it fun to go home at the end of the day. Shannon went above and beyond to make the space delightful. She literally thought of everything you would want/need and then some. The bed was so comfortable and everything felt in spit spot shape. Hospitality is clearly Shannon's gifting because she made it feel so comfortable and like a place you will want to visit again. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of some fabulous places to eat. It was the perfect backdrop to have a leisurely tea and breakfast morning and then a great place to listen to records (there is a record player/records to borrow) and play card games at night. We can't wait to come back in the Summer to see Seattle in bloom! "
1023693,23116409,2014-11-23,23305965,Melanie,"The host was incredibly accommodating and prompt with her responses (getting back to any questions or e-mails within minutes of being sent out). The apartment was even cozier then expected and instantly felt like home. The added touch was the personalized note and decadent treats she left us to enjoy upon our arrival and through out our stay. The neighbourhood was the reason we chose this apartment since it was so close to all of the shops and restaurants we wanted to visit along the Ballard strip. The host left us great recommendations of places to eat, shop, visit, which added must do's to our list. We would not hesitate to stay here again and will be recommending it to any of our friends and family members who are looking for somewhere in the Ballard area. Thank you for having supplied us with such a fantastic home away from home for my husbands birthday weekend in one of our favourite cities!! "
1023693,23341440,2014-11-29,11823306,Stacie,"Shannon was very accommodating to our ever changing travel schedule. Her apartment is in a cute neighborhood with lots of fun restaurants to walk to! Super clean apartment with a very Seattle-like vibe. The apartment was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a fun record player, board games, and books that were available as well and a really cute kitchen that unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to cook in. Next time!"
1023693,23654155,2014-12-07,10321369,Chris,"I enjoyed my stay in Shannon's clean and cozy basement apartment. It is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with ample parking and convenient transit. Shannon was communicative and overall I enjoyed my time in Seattle!"
1023693,24028425,2014-12-17,23748239,Taylor,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Shannon's basement apartment for a week and it was WONDERFUL! The apartment is really comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen is great. We arrived to a fresh gallon of milk in the fridge, a bowl of chocolate truffles (they were gone really quickly), and nice fluffy robes. Everything you could possible need was provided! I wish I had brought some slippers because the concrete floors were a tad cold. We even had a minor incident with the water heater breaking and pooling, but Shannon was awesome! Shannon was responsive in the middle of the night, and had the heater replaced the next day while we were out and about. This could have tarnished our vacation but there was no inconvenience. Not to mention she brought us flowers and cider : ) In addition, the local restaurants are great - try the Delancey, Honore Bakery, and the Fat Hen. We had bikes with us which made exploring Ballard a wonderful experience. Would love to stay here again and this stay has made us decide we'll be making a move to Ballard! Thanks! : )"
1023693,24540640,2014-12-30,20650916,Cj,"This was my first Air BnB experience and I could not have been happier. This is a dedicated space with lots of amenities. Shannon had everything ready on time, the hand off was super easy and the apartment was really clean with tons of fun stuff to do. 

The location is great. Highly would absolutely recommend this space for anyone looking for a starting point for a Seattle adventure. "
1023693,26186042,2015-02-06,1128976,Vanessa,Shannon's place is absolutely adorable and I can't say enough good things about it. She makes the check in and stay seamless. The location is perfect. The bed is so comfortable!! And more. She clearly pays attentions to detail. Thanks for a lovely week Shannon and I'll definitely try to re book in future visits. 
1023693,27416456,2015-03-03,1513155,Rachel,"This was such a perfect place to stay! The apartment is adorable, immaculate, fun and functional. I can't imagine wanting anything more from an AirBnB. The location is in a very cute residential neighborhood in Ballard. There were some great restaurants very close to the apartment, and downtown Ballard has tons of restaurants and cafes! I loved it here. "
1023693,27555526,2015-03-07,19350163,Tyler,We loved Ballard and the home was great! Clean and the kitchen had more than we needed! 
1023693,28423885,2015-03-23,24135527,Patrick,Great basement unit! Really loved the style! The wall heaters worked great even though it was cold out. Parking was convenient. Internet was fast and worked great.
1023693,28815763,2015-03-30,1972432,Bashak,"Shannon was a very good host and communicative, both prior to and during our stay. We also really appreciated that she let us keep our bags in the apartment after we checked-out, since our flight was at midnight. We also really liked the detailed rules and suggestions (for bars, restaurants, etc.) she left for us. 

The apartment is quiet and very comfortable. Great amenities, an amazing kitchen, and everything exactly as described. 

Ballard is a really nice neighborhood, quiet and cute. It's about a 30 min bus ride to downtown Seattle, much shorter if you take Uber or Lyft (around 10 mins if there's no traffic, and about $15-20). I think the distance is manageable if you don't have to be in downtown Seattle all the time. Unfortunately, we had to be in downtown Seattle from early morning until late evening for a conference, three days in a row. So the location didn't end up working perfectly for us, but if you have a more laid back schedule, then Ballard is really great. 

Overall, we had a good experience and I would definitely recommend the apartment and Shannon as a host. "
1023693,29193731,2015-04-05,18143603,Diana,"This Ballard MIL is cozy and cute... Very good for a base of you have lots of local activities planned. Take note that there is no oven or microwave, so reheating stuff is on stovetop only. And, you can here renters in upstairs house --- they were respectful of quiet times, just don't be surprised if you can clearly hear folks playing Yahtzee at 9pm. Shannon is great host and the place is accurately described... Cozy! "
1023693,30459335,2015-04-22,4468667,Krystle,Shannon was very helpful in setting us up at her place. The apartment was adorable and freshly cleaned. Great location for public transit. Had a wonderful stay!
1023693,30774404,2015-04-27,27382589,Vanessa,"Shannon's apartment was truly lovely! I booked it for my parents while they were in town and they really enjoyed their stay. The suite was impeccable, beautifully decorated, and in a great neighbourhood - handy to all that Ballard has to offer.  Shannon was great to communicate with, and made the whole process super easy!  "
1023693,32713178,2015-05-20,32668771,Tori,"Shannon was wonderfully hospitable and accommodating! My flight didn't get in until late that night, but my friend who also stayed at the airbnb was able to meet her earlier in the day to check in and get the key. There was a cute dish of sweets on the kitchen table for us to enjoy when we got there, as well as tea and coffee! Everything was clean, neat and so homey. "
1023693,33129133,2015-05-25,16907346,Erin,"Nice spot in an utterly charming neighborhood, and well tooled as a base camp for someone planning to charge up with coffee and breakfast at home, then head out into the world. Don't let the basement factor scare you: There's plenty of natural light and my husband, despite his allergies, had no issues at all. The guestbook is singularly awesome. The fuzzy socks are a must. Overall, great stay! Thanks Shannon!"
1023693,33826877,2015-06-01,32723451,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful experience overall, and Shannon was an exceptional host!

The apartment was very clean and nicely updated, and was a good size for two people.  The bed was quite comfortable, and the kitchen was fully stocked if we had wanted to cook at all.  The unit is on the bottom level of the house, and we could hear footsteps from the house above but overall it was very quiet and private. 

Shannon reached out by text soon after our flight landed and was happy to answer questions throughout our stay.  

Overall, I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking to stay in Ballard."
1023693,34483043,2015-06-08,34198104,Craig,"The Cozy Hip Vintage MIL was our very first AirBNB experience and thanks Shannon it will not be our last.  First, it is located in the very quaint neighborhood of Ballard where you can walk to breakfast or a coffee shops and enjoy the beautiful neighborhood gardens along the way.  Ballard is close to everything we were looking for and very safe.  The apartment is really cute, well furnished and decorated with a nifty vintage theme.  The kitchen is stocked with coffee, teas, milk, mineral water, butter, etc and best of all I was introduced to my first cup of coffee from a Bialetti, it was great!  She has spent a lot of attention to details which made our experience perfect."
1023693,35450167,2015-06-19,482402,Lin,"Beautiful home, well furnished and extremely comfortable! Shannon was a great host, easily reachable and accommodating to our requests. The neighbourhood is quiet, but near some really good eateries. Highly recommended!"
1023693,36031901,2015-06-24,17608525,Matthew,"Shannon was very helpful and the place was just as described. Very quiet neighborhood but close enough to downtown Ballard as well as a short ride into Fremont, downtown Seattle, etc. Shannon's recommendations were awesome. Thanks!"
1023693,36384766,2015-06-28,31540527,Michelle,What a delightful place to stay!  I only wish we could have stayed longer!  This is the first time we have used Air BnB and I am sold! I felt so at home from the moment I walked in. Everything we needed was provided. The location was fantastic!  We could walk around nearby to a lot of trendy shops and restaurants and it was only 10-15 minutes to touristy things like Pike Place. I would definitely love to stay here again!
1023693,37414053,2015-07-06,7434716,Omar,"Shannon was great. I really enjoyed staying at her place. This place is a treat, located in a great neighborhood, the details and feel of the place make you feel at home. I highly recommend her place if you are visiting."
1023693,37803136,2015-07-10,23958274,Esme,"Shannon was the most gracious host with beautiful vintage modern taste. The place was immaculate -- a  perfect, cozy getaway for a couple in dire need of some R & R from work, Los Angeles and a 2-year-old. We made the most of the immediate neighborhood, too: awesome restaurants, shopping, movies and massages. Thank you so, so much. "
1023693,39175400,2015-07-21,34780897,Stacey,"Great neighborhood, super cute spot. Shannon is a fab hostess."
1023693,39914074,2015-07-27,5667716,Bethany,"Shannon's apartment was exactly as pictured.  It was clean, comfortable, and very cute.  She goes the extra mile to provide you with great recommendations in the neighborhood and even brought me a iron and ironing board so that I could iron my bridesmaid dress.  The location is convenient to downtown Seattle and close to great neighborhoods, like Ballard and Fremont.  I would definitely stay there again!"
1023693,40364574,2015-07-30,337159,Thomas,"Nice place and Shannon very helpful/pleasant. Plus, as someone who knows Seattle well I'd say staying here is a pretty authentic Seattle experience. Plus, only a few blocks from Honore bakery. Extraordinary croissants."
1023693,40703585,2015-08-02,22963419,Kendra,"Great stay at Shannon's apartment!
The pictures are nice but the real thing is even better. 
Exceptionally clean, nice and cool in a Seattle heat wave, with everything we needed plus some extras for our stay. Shannon even got us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon an let us swing by and drop our bags off early. 
As a first time air bnb user this definitely made us feel confident in the service. 
Thanks so much shannon!"
1023693,41220078,2015-08-05,19656108,Chelsey,"We had a great stay. The apartment was beautiful and clean and cozy, just like Shannon described it. The kitchen amenities as well as the keypad entry were very convenient. The neighborhood was adorable and had many delicious restaurants. We did hear the upstairs neighbors from time to time, as Shannon had mentioned, but we did not find it disruptive. Would love to stay again!"
1023693,42317691,2015-08-12,39475571,Jeff,"Shannon was a great host, she was affable, timely, and highly accommodating. The listing was exactly as advertised--her place was clean and super cozy. The Ballard neighborhood is really cool with lots to do. Shannon's place is within walking distance to many different local attractions. Overall, my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended!"
1023693,44300151,2015-08-25,36239954,Jackie,"Shannon's MIL Apt was PERFECT! So much space, great location, and she made us feel welcomed with cute little touches. For instance, she left us some beer, sparkling water, and milk in the fridge, as well as delicious chocolates and caramels. Her itinerary/rental overview has great suggestions for places to check out in the area, and was super straight forward. Ballard Ave has plenty of restaurants and bars to try, and a great community feel. You can tell Shannon has put thought and effort into creating a unique space for guests, and she was a pleasure to interact with. I would 100% recommend to other guests looking for a place to stay. "
1023693,44918745,2015-08-30,29067551,Molly,"I had a great stay at Shannon's place.  The apartment was very clean, immaculately organized and bright for a basement apartment.  It has a ridiculously comfy bed and fun touches like little chocolates and a very creative guest book (I loved seeing the entries from previous guests).  Very quiet street, never had any problems parking a rental car right out front.
All my communication with Shannon was answered promptly and there were very clear and convenient instructions for checking in and out."
1023693,46622431,2015-09-12,16878506,Christine,"We absolutely loved staying here. The apartment was very comfortable and well designed. It is about a 15-20 min walk to the main Ballard drag, but we didn't mind walking through the very cute neighborhoods. I highly recommend this place!"
1023693,49047889,2015-09-30,44110208,Michelle,"This place is great! The place has a good amount of space and was very clean. It was nice to have a kitchen stocked with the necessities (plates, pots, pans, knives, etc.). Shannon was very friendly and responsive.  Love Ballard and the surrounding neighborhood. "
1023693,55195204,2015-11-29,12879602,Douglas,"Shannon met us on our arrival and showed us around the property and she remained easily accessible during our entire stay. Though in the 'basement', the unit was quite spacious. The shower-tub were very good as were the bath and bed linens and pillows. We appreciated the many tools and amenities in the kitchen and bathroom that left us wanting for nothing. 

The only shortcoming was the inability to directly control the forced air heating system that is controlled by the thermostat in the upstairs unit. We were never uncomfortable but direct control would be preferred. It should also be noted that there is  no television in the unit."
1023693,55852674,2015-12-06,8950611,Wayne,"Shannon's MIL is such a comfortable, welcoming, well-appointed space. The decor, furniture, lighting, bed, kitchen, bathroom, linens... all perfect. Really a great bed! I stayed for five days and would gladly have stayed much longer if I needed. The location is walkable to so many good things: wine shops, restaurants, parks, grocery stores. Unlike Old Ballard, the neighborhood is also easily accessible from elsewhere in the city. "
19611,31048,2010-03-23,88951,Christy,"We had a fabulous time. #338 Urban Oasis is a great unit for four or fewer people. I traveled with my two daughters and a friend and it worked out great. The unit is nicely decorated and the kitchen has all of the utensils and pots/pans we needed (we made chocolate linguine from Pike's street market and put it over Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from the grocery just down the block . . . absolutely delicious). The unit is within walking distance of great shopping (Norstrom Rack, H&M, etc.) and the secure parking is a great feature. We hope to stay there again in the future and may even try to figure out how to ride the bus in the ""ride free zone."""
19611,131119,2010-11-01,246009,Kathy,Everything was wonderful and comfortable.  We had all we needed to have an enjoyable time. Fully stocked kitchen and a nice welcome package. The bed had a temperpedic topper that was very comfortable. Directions to the apt were clear and the bus line was just outside the door.  The area was a little down but not enough to be afraid of our safety.  My only complaint and it wasn't with the accomadations  The fees that Air bnb charges was not clearly stated and the cleaning fee wasn't included in the price of the apt.  I spent closely to 200 a night so that should have been absorbed.  But over all I was very pleased with out time there. 
19611,168876,2011-01-10,313874,Phil,"Lovely apartment, great kitchen, amazingly quiet given the sometimes bustling street scene outside. We appreciated the laundry facilities after a few days on the road. Our party of four was a bit crowded but comfortable. Proximity to transport, entertainment, markets, shopping and eating was excellent. We really enjoyed it. Thanks for a wonderful stay in fascinating Seattle. "
19611,445563,2011-08-15,145457,Aprilyn,"Very comfortable unit. Convenient location with an easy walk to Pike Place Market or Downtown for some endless shopping. Checking in/out was a breeze because the instructions were so clear and concise and the welcome package, which included a map of all sights in Seattle, was a nice little touch. I thoroughly enjoyed the balcony overlooking 3rd Ave. It was a little noisy when the windows/balcony door was open because there is a bus stop directly in front of the building, which is actually a positive for those without a rental. We had a rental so it was nice to have secure parking in the building. The rest of the amenities of the building were amazing. I absolutely fell in love with the rooftop deck. My only complaint about the unit was that there was a strange smell possibly coming from the garbage disposal, which may have been from the tenants before us. We also had some difficulty with the wireless but immediate help was just a phone call away. Overall we had a positive experience. Until we meet again, Seattle. "
19611,678527,2011-11-01,977795,Charles,"we were just moving in from France. first 15 days in town !
very good experience
all was very well at Darik's place !
near everything downtown"
19611,898126,2012-02-02,1027822,Matthew,"Nice place.  Great kitchen, but who needs a kitchen in this neighborhood?"
19611,1126845,2012-04-14,1615836,Josh & Ashley,"We had a lovely stay in Seattle and the Oasis was in a perfect location for our brief trip. The room was comfortable, clean and well-decorated. We took advantage of the kitchen with its fully-stocked supplies & utensils and made a dinner fresh from Pike Place Market. The condo is located in the center of Belltown and within blocks of the market, many of Tom Douglas' wonderful restaurants and several department stores. 

If you have a couple days to sight-see, I highly recommend a Savor Seattle food tour of Pike Place Market, a quick drive up to Kerry Park for a phenomenal view of the skyline and a day-trip to Everett for a whale-watching tour. 

We had a great time in Seattle and would stay at the Seattle Oasis again without hesitation!"
19611,1266214,2012-05-12,1992108,Ping, Never met our host but the instructions on checking in was very clear so no problems there.  It is a great place to stay!  You can get anywhere within 10-15 minutes by foot if you're just planning to stay downtown.  The room is very clean and has almost all of the amenities that you'll need.  Highly recommend!
19611,2946508,2012-11-23,3934112,Daniel,"Good flat, good location, everything went smooth."
19611,3193151,2012-12-31,1533167,Rob And Tiff,"We had a great time, and the apartment was perfect for the two of us.  Great location for walking around the city, and nice, clean accommodations.  "
19611,3310926,2013-01-08,411697,Daniel,"The apartment is fantastic, very well decorated, comfortable and clean. You feel like you're living in a model apartment, designed and decorated by a professional. The host was very gracious with the instructions on how to arrive, park the car, reach the apartment, etc. The building was also nice and we regularly used the gyms in the morning (it was mostly empty). The location was a plus and a minus for the apartment: for day attractions, you're blocks away from the Space Needle, many museums and coffee shops, about 15min walk to Pike Market, so no complaints there. During the night, though, if you walk in the wrong direction the neighborhood can get pretty sketchy - don't try walking to Pike Place Market at night for dinner or you'll cross some strange, strange intersections. Luckily there were a few nice restaurants for dinner just a few blocks way on 1st and 2nd avenue."
19611,3331867,2013-01-12,1034277,Marli,"This was my first time having a GREAT AirBNB experience. I had booked once before and was horrible experience so I was hesitant to try again, but so glad I did. 
This was a great property that truly thought of everything for the guest and was super easy process. The unit had everything one needs: kitchen with all appliances, utensils and even bakeware.  Also had sponges and dish soap and dishwasher too. The stacked washer and dryer was so convenient and even had detergent and fabric softener. 
Welcome kit had all instruction details for unit, coffee, microwave popcorn and 2 bottle each of sparkling and still water. SUCH A NICE TOUCH!
Place was a little noisy being at a bus stop, but can't beat location so was worth it and there is no where else in city where you could park for free in secure covered spot. 
Can't say enough good things. Would highly recommend!"
19611,4183467,2013-04-16,3811127,Amy,This was an amazing space and location.  Darik was awesome.  I would recommend this or any of his properties to anyone.  I truly felt at home.  
19611,7296702,2013-09-14,1304856,Geneviève,"We stayed here for  two days while we explored Mount Rainier and Pike Place. The condo is nicely decorated but had a hotel feel to it which we were trying to get away from by using AirBnB. It was well stocked and centrally located. We liked the secure parking. My issues would be that the condo was unbearably hot and has no air conditioning. Being on a very busy street you can't open the windows and get a good nights sleep so for that reason I would not stay here again. Another small issue is that I was charged a cleaning fee yet I was left with instructions to take my garbage out, wash my bed linens and towels and start the dishwasher all before I checked out. "
19611,7988223,2013-10-11,9077322,Arran,"Good location, we'll equipped lovely little place, no hassle to check in. Was quite warm at night but overall ideal for our mini break"
19611,9978971,2014-01-22,4367226,Shane,"My family and I greatly enjoyed Darik's condo. The check in and out procedures where clearly described via email. I was not in personal contact with Darik since check in and check out was automated. The room was clean, had a well equipped kitchen, and had all the conveniences of home. The neighborhood was lovely. I would stay here again."
19611,10717187,2014-03-04,5847956,Alyshamaryc,"Very clean and comfortable, felt right at home. Excellent location. Couldn't have asked for anything better!"
19611,11090466,2014-03-20,4706512,Brendan,"great spot! clean, well decorated and stocked. would stay here again in a second! "
19611,11162190,2014-03-23,350087,Adine And David,"The location and roof top deck with spectacular views and great outdoor furniture make this a really super downtown rental.  You can walk everywhere from here - we left our car in the underground garage the whole time.  The kitchen is well stocked - better than I have experienced in any airbnb to date and the bathroom comes well supplied with loads of towels.  

We missed the personal airbnb touches (meeting the hosts or emailing with them) but did find everything went very smoothly from booking, to checking in and checking out.  

We did find the master bedroom a bit noisy at night  from outdoor traffic and pedestrian noise (we had the window closed) and the apartment/building was on the warm and stuffy side.  It is on the small side as well…too small for our family of 4 …but would be a great size for one or two.  The bathroom door is a sliding door which isn't the most private (it has privacy gaps on the sides) and it slipped off the hinges a couple of times.  The apartment, appliances and contents were very clean and tidy.

All in all a professional rental."
19611,21442244,2014-10-17,1381793,Stephanie,This is very much a corporate housing type of Airbnb. The apartment is nice and appears as the photos but is quite a lot smaller than one would expect. It was easy to gain entry and nice that they had a small welcome basket. Unfortunately some parts were not functioning such as the sink which was clogged the entire time. If you're looking for somewhere that is nice for sleeping and in a close proximity to downtown this works.
19611,23643728,2014-12-07,20336245,Anna,"We checked in late around midnight. The instructions were super detailed and we found everything with ease. It was extremely cold that night and our heater wasn't working. We ended up sleeping without the heater and coming from California, it was unbearable. We called the number provided and the lady was instructing us to locate the breaker and make sure everything is on. Well, being 3 girls, we didn't know very much about circuit breakers. We ended up turning off all lights except the bathroom and kitchen lights and had no power anywhere else. We eventually gave up and just went to sleep. Also, we didn't have parking pass in our apartment like the instructions said we would. Everything ended up getting fixed the next morning and they made it up by giving us a $20 gift card to a local bakery.

The apartment does look smaller than in pictures but the appearance of everything was on point. The kitchen is fully equipped, plenty of towels and blankets. The towels feels extremely soft! 4 toilet rolls were provided. Care package was also provided which included 2 bottles of water, 2 Perrier, some green tea packets, york chocolates, popcorn, other snacks. Location was PERFECT. Close to many restaurants and grocery stores. Couldn't ask for a better stay. "
19611,23896232,2014-12-14,16000005,Judy,"I liked that they called me when they haven't heard from me. The place is easy to get to and easy to get to the parking garage. However, the suite was smaller than I expected. The curtains were of poor quality and kept falling off every time I opened the window. The bed was very comfortable, but I agree with everyone else that it gets really stuffy in there and there's no AC or ventilation. If you do open the window, expect a lot of street noise. The bathroom door is horrendous. It's just a sliding Japanese door and doesn't close all the way. If you're staying with other people, don't expect any privacy. The kitchen was well stocked. The living room is in dire need of a coffee table. Anything with a flat surface would've been great actually. They had two ottomans but you can't put anything on it without it falling over. They had these individual fold-able tray tables, but I find that cheapens the place even more. The worst part about my stay is that they had given me an expired parking pass and I ended up getting a ticket for parking in their garage. Even though it was resolved quickly, it just seems like an inconvenience of my comfort and time. "
19611,28699616,2015-03-29,19907571,Sophia,"The apartment is cute, clean and pleasant. Both the bed and the pull-out couch bed are large and comfortable. I really appreciated the kitchen, which has pots, pans, knives, pretty much everything you'd need to cook—but bring your own bottle opener, I couldn't find one! There were 4 of us staying here and it was perfect for us. I would say that if you're traveling with people who aren't your close friends, this apartment might be a little difficult for 4 people. It is on the small side and as other reviewers have mentioned, the sliding doors on the bedroom and bathroom really don't provide privacy. That said, we had a great time there and loved exploring the surrounding neighborhoods."
19611,31867961,2015-05-11,18888630,Edward,"A standard vacation rental in the heart of Belltown. The pictures are accurate. Close walks to Pike Market and Spaceneedle. Yummy restaurants and coffee shops all around. Its a great deal for what you pay. Even if the reviews are correct- it gets a bit stuffy in the apartment with no AC and the street noise is significant if you need to have the windows open.
Overall a very enjoyable 2 weeks in one of my favorite cities!"
19611,46155706,2015-09-08,28369322,Andrew,"Fantastic location in Belltown! Everything (sights, restaurants, bars, etc) is within walking distance. Great apartment for a weekend getaway. We loved the rooftop patio as well!"
19611,53743517,2015-11-12,30741509,Nick,"Although we never met, Darik (and Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals by extension) made us feel very welcome. The rental, however, was a different story. It's a lot smaller than the pictures let on, the cleaning crew was not done by check-in time, and there's cosmetic damage to the paint and furniture that resulted in paint chips on the floor. If this is your first time in Seattle, this location is fantastic as it's within walking distance of a lot of big downtown Seattle attractions (Pike's Place market, Space Needle, Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room, several bars, underground tour, etc.)"
385438,1717973,2012-07-16,2196414,Deb,"The home is lovely, but the pictures make it look much larger than it is. It is ideal for 4 people. The extra mattress to put on the floor of the living room can accommodate one additional person. The garage is useful for keeping vehicle safe, and it is important to know the number of the space to occupy. I was initially nervous because I did not have a number of a local person for emergencies, but we did not have any emergencies, so that was not a problem. We were not able to figure out how to operate the TV, though it did work, it was just too confusing for us. We could not get the coffeemaker to operate either, though I believe it did work. The ice water from the fridge was delicious. We enjoyed using the nice cutlery to prepare fresh fruit purchased at Pike Market. We made eggs one morning for breakfast. There were no instructions for us in the kitchen, so we were not sure what was for our use. The beds were very comfortable. They had air conditioning which was nice in the warm weather. It was not within walking distance of any grocery stores or restaurants that we could find. It would have been great to have had a list of recommended grocery stores and restaurants nearest. I wasn't sure how to operate the broiler, and we chose not to use the grill outside, so we did not cook supper there. Since we were their first AirBnB guests, and it was our first time to be AirBnB guests, it all was really great in the end. Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
385438,1754639,2012-07-20,1382108,Jeff & Amy,We stayed here for 3 nights while visitng Seattle.  The condo had everything we needed including a parking spot for our car and was very close to the Space Needle and Downtown.  
385438,45154263,2015-08-31,27981557,James,"The condo was amazing, really great location and great place.  The host had the best communication I have ever experienced, everything was perfect."
385438,46187468,2015-09-08,41711554,Roxanne,"Our stay was quite nice, the condo was clean and welcoming. Also, the host was very helpful and easy to work with.  The location of this listing is great- Within walking distance of many cool stores and restaurants and easy access to the highway. Parking was a little bit of a struggle after 5pm. There is a parking lot in front of the building however it fills up quickly so once you park try not to move. This is when we relied on other services to get around. "
3727017,19243423,2014-09-08,9374856,Patrick,"We had an excellent stay at Ted's home. Much of the home is recently renovated/updated, but it retains some nice old elements in the kitchen and common areas. The space was very bright, clean, spacious and nicely furnished. Beds were very comfortable. We spent a good bit of time in the garden sitting area at the side of the house, which is nicely private but gives a glimpse of the neighbourhood's street life.   
  
Ted was easy to reach and helpful. The location was great as well; walking distance to Capitol Hill and walking/short cab ride to downtown, but in a nice quiet neighbourhood. All in all, a great place to stay. I would highly recommend it.  "
3727017,19646988,2014-09-15,4291506,Dayoung,"Ted's house was very charming indeed!
I stayed at his house over a weekend with my husband and his best friend. 
As soon as we enter the house, already in love with the place. 
It was very bright with big windows everywhere. The ambience with full of light and green plants they have inside the house is very inviting and cozy. You can immediately feel the love and effort both Ted and his wife put into their home. 
The kitchen was very spacious and well equipped.
The beds rooms are comfortable with fluffy bedding. 
We received a bottle of wine and home grown vegetables as welcome gift from them. That was very surprising. 
Process of check in/out was very smooth and quick. 
Location of the house is very accessible to all places like Capitol Hill, down town, space needle and pike market. All with in 5-15 min. drive away. 
If you are planning to visit Seattle, check Ted's place out. You won't regret it. "
3727017,43067896,2015-08-17,4256599,Edwin,"Ted and his wife where great! … And made us feel right at home.  If you want to get to know the true Seattle this is the place for you! Location is near Capitol Hill’s restaurants, bars and parks.  My family and I would definitely stay in this Charming Craftsman home again. Thank you Guys!"
8919070,51829779,2015-10-24,3057406,Jessica,"Conor made my husband and I feel so welcomed in his home! He was incredibly flexible with our travel plans, and went out of his was to accommodate our late arrival. The apartment was spotless, and the photo of the pullout sofa does no justice to how comfortable it was (we slept SO well!). Conor has every TV and movie channel imaginable - it was nice to relax when the weather was inclement. We really enjoyed using the kitchen (all new appliances) as well. He had plenty of breakfast goodies like bagels and creamcheese, muffins, coffee and eggs for our mornings. One of the best things was also the location- it was less than a few blocks from the main strip of California and Alaska, in West Seattle. PERFECT for our needs while we explored the City. "
8919070,52381580,2015-10-28,17720200,Greg,"My girlfriend and I were greeted with a warm and clean condo, complete with wine, beer, clean towels, and a freshly made pull out sofa bed. The bathroom was clean and the shower was nicely hot and refreshing. It was truly a great experience in a lively city. "
8919070,52655448,2015-10-31,24083058,Annemarie & Michael,We had a good time at Conor's place. He is a nice and welcoming host. Although we stayed on the couch we had enough privacy. Everything was clean and tidy and we could use the fully equipped kitchen. We even got breakfast! The neighbourhood is nice too. We can recommend staying with him.
8919070,54477221,2015-11-20,41156892,Iara,"Conor has a very well located apartment in the SW of Seattle. The apartment is very pleasant and the couch is very comfy. It's very easy and fast go from his apartment to downtown.
About Conor, well, he is fantastic. He was a delightful host. We (me and my boyfriend) really felt like home in his apartment. It turned out that besides a host he was a friend as well. Thank you for the incredible time we had at Seattle, Conor."
7179783,56423407,2015-12-13,17899311,Ilse,"Katie's beautiful, clean and cozy town home was perfect for us. She was super flexible about check in/out time, and made us feel right at home. The town house is located right in the heart of Capitol Hill, walking distance of a lot of great restaurants, coffee shops and bars. I will definitely stay at her place again next time I'm in Seattle. "
173896,413591,2011-08-01,884090,Paul,The studio cottage was a cozy and nicely decorated. Doug and Lori were friendly and very pleasant. They cheerfully provided us with an iron and ironing board so we could get ready for a wedding. Helpful tips on where to eat. 
173896,441761,2011-08-13,877154,Jenelle,"The studio was very comfortable, clean, and well decorated. The lodging allows for both privacy and access to friendly and informative hosts. Doug and Lori were extraordinarily accommodating. They have excellent property in an amazing neighborhood - Ballard is just as exciting to explore as downtown Seattle! Highly recommended! "
173896,444300,2011-08-14,850141,Adam,"We had a great time at the Studio Cottage!  Doug and Lori were both extremely nice and made great local suggestions for places to visit and eat, etc.  The room was very clean and neat, with a wicked comfy bed and nice bathroom.  We particularly enjoyed experiencing Seattle from a neighborhood OUTSIDE of downtown.  We brought our bikes and explored for miles on the numerous bike paths accessible just a few blocks away.  I definitely recommend!"
173896,448969,2011-08-15,947968,Minet,"This is a gem!
Doug and Lori are fantastic hosts. The room is very spacious with lots of privacy and there is lots to do within the neighbourhood.
Hopefully we will make it down to Seattle soon and stay here again!"
173896,454709,2011-08-17,106128,Peter,"I was just in town for one night, but this was a great to place to stay.  I was visiting a friend who lives in the Ballard neighborhood, so the location was perfect."
173896,467624,2011-08-22,966157,Mandy,"Clean, quiet, private, and close to funky restaurants and shops.  The perfect place to lay our tired heads after a full day on the town.  Doug and Lori were great hosts and they provided some excellent suggestions for dining out."
173896,473103,2011-08-24,668010,Franciska,Clean and private space in nice neighborhood close to everything. Doug and Lori made us feel very welcome and gave us good advice to nearby dining etc. I can easily recommend staying here.
173896,506344,2011-09-06,120729,Bradford,"Doug and Lori's studio cottage was perfect for what we needed.  Located in a wonderful neighborhood within walking distance to the best of Ballard, the cottage is simple and wonderfully kept.  It is small and cozy but perfect for a couple looking to spend the day outdoors exploring.  Quiet neighborhood for nights and easy access to other cool neighborhoods in the area.  And Doug and Lori are incredibly nice and helpful, great suggestions on the area, and wonderful with check in.  If you are looking for a small and affordable Seattle get away, the studio cottage is perfect!
  Would stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks for a wonderful experience.
Brad and Nicole"
173896,528839,2011-09-13,161489,Emery,Staying at Doug and Lori's made our first trip to Seattle just perfect. Their location was ideal. Quiet and private but close to anything we wanted. I highly recommend their studio cottage as a great alternative to impersonal and generic hotels.
173896,551202,2011-09-20,1039505,Dolores,The Studio Cottage was absolutely charming - so different than staying in a motel.  The french doors made it feel like staying at a friend's house.  We made use of the bench just outside the door for reading in the sun.  The cottage is within walking distance of the public library and the QFC market.  The gardens on the property are extensive and lovely.  My husband really liked the chickens on the property.  Lori and Doug were friendly and available.  We would definitely stay at the Studio Cottage again. 
173896,562671,2011-09-24,88780,Sarah,This is the perfect spot for our out of town guests visiting us in Ballard.  The location is awesome and the accommodations/hosts are great.  
173896,669673,2011-10-27,1093173,Larry,"My fiancee and I felt welcome and the cottage was as described.  The location is amazing i.e., walking distance to Shilshole, Golden Gardens, Ray's Boathouse etc..  We had a good time just walking around the neighborhood looking at the wonderful houses and yards"
173896,1113693,2012-04-12,629597,Angela,Doug and Lori were fantastic hosts. The room was perfect for us. It was very clean and in the perfect location to enjoy both Ballard and the city. It's in walking distance to all of the great Ballard restaurants and shops as well as an easy commute to the city by bus. Doug and Lori were also so helpful in answering all of our questions about the area and gave some fantastic restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again!

173896,2007934,2012-08-16,138273,Kate,"My mother, little dog - Louie, and I found this cute little studio to be a delightful retreat. Mini-fridge was a nice bonus for leftover dinner pizza. Enjoyed the little bench outside and the garden. And we are thankful that they were able to accommodate us last minute. Good street parking too.

173896,2078459,2012-08-23,3311224,Carrie,Doug and Lori were wonderful!  They are there if you need anything!  
173896,2119180,2012-08-27,3340839,Nick,Had the pleasure of staying here for a couple of days and I must say that Doug and Lori are some of the kindest and most welcoming hosts I have had the pleasure of meeting. I would rent this place again just to go hang out with them! 
173896,2412443,2012-09-25,516671,Joyce,"The studio is a cozy place to land in the heart of Ballard. It is an easy walk to destination coffee shops, the farmers market and the locks. The hosts are warm and welcoming."
173896,2536798,2012-10-08,3137332,Jane,"This little space in Ballard is super clean, quiet and cozy with fantastic artsy details that made staying there fun. I felt very safe to stay there by myself. In addition,  Doug and Lori went out of their way to make my stay very nice or more ways than one.  Don't hesitate to stay here! It's simply wonderful. "
173896,4563093,2013-05-13,5090732,Jay,"Great location if you want peace and quiet. Easy to book, check in, and check out. Doug and Lori are very nice and helpful from the time of booking and during the stay. I will be back for sure. "
173896,4815813,2013-05-27,3052971,Colleen & Ryan,"Doug and Lori were awesome hosts who provided a lot of great information about local restaurants and attractions. They were very accommodating, friendly, and vibrant. The studio is very cozy and absolutely adorable! It served as an excellent ""home base"" as we adventured around Seattle and it is located within walking distance of everything Ballard has to offer. We would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone and would certainly stay here again ourselves."
173896,5296009,2013-06-23,6456273,James,"Great neighborhood. If you are not a walker, bring a car, though. Five minute walk to Walter's for morning coffee and conversation, but it's uphill. Ten to 15 minute walk to dinner and drinks. Bus system was not designed for tourists. 

Room was cozy for two, but we did not spend lots of time there.

Great hosts. Love the yards. Love the fact that Lori had a charge cord for Carol's computer."
173896,5546577,2013-07-05,6847567,Jimmi,"We rented this place due to its proximity to the Ballard strip. Also a quick 10 minute walk to the Salmon Locks. The room and bathroom were cozy, and I don't mean in the misleading nomenclature kind of way. The room was equipped with large opening windows and an opening skylight for airflow and light. The bed was very comfortable for the two of us.

You won't spend much time in this room, but it does what it was designed to do and then some; Sleep very comfortably, relax, recover, get out into the city. Quaint neighborhood and only a 15 minute walk to the Ballard nightlife. The garden and chickens is a nice rustic feel. It should be used more, as we were hoping to run into some of the other Bed and Breakfast tourists who were there. But probably most people are on the go. Lori was very helpful, and only a minute away if we had any troubles."
173896,6106474,2013-07-30,6787429,Amanda,Perfect location with easy access to Ballard and Downtown Seattle.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  This was a great home base for exploring Seattle and surrounding areas.  Doug and Lori were very nice and offered a lot of helpful information regarding things to do in the area.  I would definitely stay here again!
173896,6569461,2013-08-17,7745447,Kenny,"Simple, bright and sweet.  This was a perfect spot to catch some zzz's between busy activities in Ballard."
173896,6758048,2013-08-24,2250055,Eliza,Lovely room in Ballard in quiet neighborhood in easy walking distance to the wonderful Chittenden Locks. 
173896,7213144,2013-09-10,3401076,David,The studio was conveniently accessed and in a great neighborhood. Perfect set up and clean and nicely decorated. Met both hosts and they each were a delight. Will be heading back there soon. 
173896,11589916,2014-04-08,12710664,Rachel,"Great location and great hosts,comfortable space "
173896,13125045,2014-05-19,15523349,Jenny,"My husband and I had a great last minute overnight urban vacation staying with Lori and Doug! Close to downtown Ballard, the water and lots of great restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay there for an overnight again!  "
173896,13581569,2014-05-31,14208467,Mitch,"Had a great time staying in Doug and Lori's bungalow. The hosts were friendly and helpful. There were two of us, and the room was cozy and efficient. The skylight provided nice light and the floor heating kept environs comfortable. The location is not too far from NW Market shops and restaurants. Easy walk to Chittenden locks and park.  Really enjoyed Ballard and surrounding areas much more than downtown touristy stuff. Had some great breakfasts/brunches in the area. "
173896,14046160,2014-06-10,12735166,Ginger,"The Studio Suite is as advertised: clean, as inviting as pictured and in a fantastic neighborhood. We had exceptional weather so being able to have the windows and skylight open was a plus. With the curtains drawn for privacy, the space still had plenty of light. Radiant heating kept the whole room comfortable, and there is a large, cushy area rug to land your feet on in the morning.

Doug and Lori were excellent hosts from the first correspondence. We met Doug as we headed out for a run, and he recommended a fun route. We happened upon Lori in the garden, and she was quick to mention the aptly named Sunset Hill Park; the view is spectacular. They easily accommodated our past-midnight check-in.

If you are looking for a small, quiet place from which to walk to breakfast, a beach, coffee shops and even a small grocer, the studio is perfect for a single traveler or couple."
173896,14285304,2014-06-16,15149273,Jacquelyn,Great place to stay! Cute studio apartment within walking distance to many different venues. Love the area!
173896,14989043,2014-06-30,592123,Tiffany,"We met the host on the last day of our trip. They were very friendly. The neighborhood was wonderful, though a bit far from downtown, but that had more to do with our needs in Seattle than the actual location. I wish we could have spent more time in Ballard. Delightfully close to the locks, a must see. There is a lovely skylight that woke us up on sunny mornings, so if you don't like to rise with the sun bring a sleep mask. "
173896,15441919,2014-07-09,12192349,Lynn,"Doug and Lori are awesome host.   The Studio was just what we expected and the neighborhood is amazing.  If you are looking for a quaint, nice place to stay within walking distance to Ballard and may local attractions this is your place.  I highly recommend."
173896,15562935,2014-07-11,17790074,Ellen,"What a great little room. We have a small dog that was welcome and gave us  place close to downtown Ballard.  I would have liked a tv but we only stayed a short time, so worked great."
173896,15678034,2014-07-14,14979968,Carla,"Doug & Lori are amazing hosts! Super accommodating and friendly. They even had the courtesy to call us after we forgot a few personal items after checking out. Fantastic location for exploring Ballard. Small, quiet and quaint. Great for one person or a couple - and dog friendly :)"
173896,17233067,2014-08-09,18759444,Matthew,Listing was exactly as posted. A great little place right near charming downtown Ballard. Doug and Lori were great hosts. Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier. Lori offered some great places to go and visit and each one that I visited was great. I really enjoyed my stay here.
173896,17453517,2014-08-12,4743231,Joel,"Comfortable, clean, basic accommodations in a very quiet part of a great neighborhood.  We had a busy weekend in Seattle so were not looking for a place in which to hang out and spend a lot of time but a convenient, reasonable place to sleep - it was perfect for our needs.  Studio is light and very cheery and set in a beautiful urban farm."
173896,17587150,2014-08-14,4190515,Carrie,"I loved my stay here. It was quiet, comfortable, and private. Lori greeted me with a neighborhood map and great suggestions for things to check out in the neighborhood. Ballard is lovely and charming, and everything you might need or want is within walking distance. Golden Gardens is a gorgeous spot nearby.  I was on a work trip and found that the August hotel prices were very high, and most decent places were sold out, but  I was lucky to find this place. "
173896,17730456,2014-08-16,47672,Nathan,"Doug and Lori's cottage was very nice, within walking distance of all the Ballard attractions. We had a great time in the two days we spent there. The neighborhood was quaint and quiet. The skylight was an extra bonus, giving lots of natural light. "
173896,17841824,2014-08-18,17480239,Sam,"I had an easy and great experience with Doug and Lori. They communicated all the details, and checking in was easy as could be. This little spot was exactly what my girlfriend and I needed, and we had everything we needed. The location was perfect, and located just a short downhill walk to downtown Ballard."
173896,18082981,2014-08-21,18060061,Adam & Heather,"We really enjoyed staying at Doug and Lori's studio. The studio is separate from the house, which was great because we did not have to worry about waking anybody up when we came in late after a wedding. They provided bedding, linens, hair dryer, soap, shampoo and conditioner, and even had several soft drinks/mineral waters in the mini fridge; the studio was very clean, too. There is easy street parking nearby, and it is in a good neighborhood. We will definitely request to stay here again for future visits to Seattle!"
173896,18212360,2014-08-23,20120928,Dondeena,"The studio was comfy, cozy and clean.  It was a perfect spot for me in a quiet neighborhood near friends.  Doug and Lori were great hosts and flexible with the arrival time.  "
173896,18674799,2014-08-30,831053,Anthony,"Lori made our arrival super easy, even though the little place is a bit hard to locate the first time. Good, quiet neighborhood. Easy walk (downhill) to breakfast; L &D's suggestions for restaurants were accurate and useful. We enjoyed our three night stay here very much. There are nearby (caged) chickens and a vegetable garden on the sidewalk nearby. We liked the country feel in a big city. You might want a car to make best use of this slightly out-of-the-way location, however. Everything was clean and well kept up. Could use more storage space (maybe shelves on a wall?) and better reading lights. As a final positive, Lori happily printed out our return boarding passes for us."
173896,18944523,2014-09-03,17916448,Amy,"The neighborhood of Ballard was lovely and I loved Doug and Lori's suggestions for coffee shops and places to eat.  I could walk to the farmer's market on Sunday and to the Locks very easily.  When I would see Doug or Lori in passing, they were very friendly and interesting to talk to.  Otherwise, the carriage house was quiet, bright and comfortable."
173896,19329905,2014-09-10,20047530,Marta,"Lori was very pleasant hostess, I felt there like at home. There was very cozy and clean, close to bus and shop. I like to go back there sometime."
173896,19691949,2014-09-16,20271366,Lois,"All communication from the initial booking was smooth and accurate.  The room was ready whenever I got into town and settled.  When I got to the room, it was well appointed, clean and comfortable.  All pictures shown from the AirBnB site was exact."
173896,20149476,2014-09-24,20277862,Sue,"I enjoyed my stay at the studio suite. 
The description was exactly as described. It was in a very nice and safe location.  I plan to stay there my next visit and would definitely recommend it.
"
173896,20323299,2014-09-27,21732634,John,"I love my stay at Doug and Lori's place! Great location, comfy and cozy! It was perfect for my two day business trip in Seattle - a nice Space to relax at the end of my day. "
173896,20530239,2014-09-30,4308287,Rose,"The space was just as listed. Its very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is fantastic. You're just far enough from Ballard Ave that there's no noise and it's easy to park, but close enough to walk to everything.  And by everything I mean really fantastic restaurants, bars, coffee, shopping and nature :) We only saw Lori for a few brief moments but she was very friendly and helpful, a real joy. "
173896,20841870,2014-10-06,2277183,Lauren,"We stayed here for two nights while attending a wedding in Discovery Park.  The place is very comfortable and exactly as described. Check in/out was a breeze, and it is located within walking distance (0.5mi)  to lots of great restaurants, the Ballard locks, and Shilshole Marina. "
173896,21845029,2014-10-25,22256038,Sarah,Just as nice as the B&B was! Doug and Lori go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and ensure you have what you need. They continue to be my home when in the Seattle office. 
173896,21996758,2014-10-27,22735393,Wilma,"We had a most comfortable stay in a clean, well organized unit with the added benefit of easy street parking."
173896,22388630,2014-11-04,23147441,John,"Extremely smooth process with checking in/out. Great space and represented well on this site. Loved the heated floors! The bed was also very comfortable. Although it's small, it was a great space for 1-2 people. "
173896,22682700,2014-11-11,947968,Minet,"Another great stay with Doug and Lori! 
Lovely space with everything we need, great neighbourhood, and easy to get around town."
173896,25369486,2015-01-13,19321579,Russell,I had a great stay in Doug and Lori's Studio. Everything I needed was provided. The place was easy to locate and check in and check out was a breeze. I would stay here again. Great location in Ballard. Double review because I extended my stay.
173896,25428028,2015-01-15,19321579,Russell,I had a great stay in Doug and Lori's Studio. Everything I needed was provided. The place was easy to locate and check in and check out was a breeze. I would stay here again. Great location in Ballard.
173896,25604322,2015-01-20,3608716,Martha,This is our second time staying in this room.  It's a nice little cozy space and in a great location in Ballard.  
173896,26087501,2015-02-02,5974053,Katie,"Doug and Lori were great hosts.  They gave us great directions, making it easy to find the place and get into the Studio.  They also gave us lots of great suggestions on where to eat and hang out around the neighborhood.  The Studio was close enough to walk to shops, bars and restaurants in the cute Ballard Blocks neighborhood.  We didn't spend too much time at the Studio but it was everything we needed: a comfy bed, bathroom, clean, and easy.  Overall great stay.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  "
173896,26312968,2015-02-09,21693046,Courtney,"Our hosts have very thoughtfully appointed this cottage with everything you need and information on visiting Seattle.  It's a compact space without a working or lounging space, but it's very comfortable and a good price.  On-street parking was never a problem.  We missed our chance to meet our hosts, though I plan to check in with them during the summer months to see their extensive vegetable gardens during the growing season."
173896,26606745,2015-02-16,26019372,Karena,"We had a great stay at Doug & Lori's studio cottage. We spent the majority of our time wandering and exploring Seattle and the cottage was a great home base. It was clean, cozy and quiet - pretty much everything we were looking for.

Looking at the map, we were worried it would be tough to get around without a car, but it was actually incredibly easy! There's a bus stop nearby that can take you downtown and plenty of dining options within walking distance."
173896,27292441,2015-03-01,11238426,Ben,"Staying at Doug and Lori's was great. The space is private, cozy, affordable, and in a beautiful neighborhood, just a short walk from the beach, bike rentals, great food and parks. The space is small but it has everything you could need for a stay. Though I never got to meet them in person, Doug and Lori were easy to communicate with (prompt responders) and very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Their space is truly lovely. Thank you guys!"
173896,29060895,2015-04-03,29281940,Barbara,Lots of guidebooks on the city. Room was as promised. 
173896,30357322,2015-04-20,31185390,Ann,"The studio suite was very comfortable and in a great location. Our stay was really great and our hosts, Doug & Lori, were very nice and offered helpful info during our stay. The studio suite was just as it was described in the listing and it suited our needs very well. Would definitely consider staying again when traveling to Seattle."
173896,30653292,2015-04-25,30712936,Matt,"Lori and Doug were great and provide an excellent accommodation!  Great location, quiet, lovely neighborhood.  Just walk down the hill to the locks.  1 to 2 minutes to colorful downtown Ballard.  Nice cozy quiet cottage.  I'll be back.  Thank you team Lori and Doug!"
173896,32538391,2015-05-19,16973853,Irena,"The studio was lovely, and even nicer than the photos! Lori and Doug sent information about the neighborhood ahead of time that was very useful, and were extremely accommodating about our schedule and requests. Highly recommended as a quiet base to explore the area from."
173896,33158577,2015-05-25,33002850,Bÿron,Wonderful and perfect place to stay in Ballard. Will hopefully be back again.
173896,33634227,2015-05-30,23388954,Rachel,Description was accurate and hosts were very responsive to requests.  Beautiful little room in a quiet neighborhood.
173896,34034682,2015-06-03,3613171,Marcela,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at Doug and Lori's Studio Suite while visiting Seattle. The place was really cozy and clean, and filled with special details: fun books and guides about Seattle, a selection of herbal teas and coffee, hand made organic soap, and all different kinds of bathroom essentials. We slept really well in the comfy bed and loved the peacefulness of the neighborhood. The suite is perfectly located in the neighborhood of Ballard and we were able to walk to restaurants, cafes, the Ballard Sunday Farmers Market, Stone Gardens Climbing/Bouldering Gym, and the Ballard Locks. We were also in close driving distance to Trader Joe's (there is a little fridge in the studio to store goodies) and to other neighborhoods in Seattle so we never felt that we had to drive a ton to get places. We got a chance to meet Doug and Lori and we got some awesome recommendations on different places to eat (you must try Walrus & the Carpenter!). They are both really nice and friendly and were very respectful of our privacy. They were also flexible in accepting our late arrival. They have a beautiful edible garden, a loving dog, and some chickens. We will be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. "
173896,34358861,2015-06-07,22784542,Anika,"Doug & Lori were very accommodating to my boyfriend, black lab, and I when we needed 4 nights of housing between leases. Most places turned us down because of the size of our dog but they allowed him in their space. It is small and does not have a kitchen as advertised but they include a fridge with beverages & snacks. It had more than I expected overall and was perfect for us. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and walking distance to the Locks, and a bit longer walk includes Golden Gardens beach & all the fun shopping & eating Ballard has to offer. I would recommend this to any traveler, and it is super easy to get around from here without a car. If you go in summer, you'll be able to see their urban garden! We were also a big fan of their unique tile work & stained glass in the studio."
173896,34528917,2015-06-09,30243694,Jolene,The guests were there to welcome us.  We had a comfy bed and plenty of choices to provide cooling air into the room as it was in the 80's.  We were able to walk to dinner on the water and walk to a great coffee shop in the morning.  The homemade mint hand soap was a nice touch.
173896,35308681,2015-06-17,20277862,Sue,"Shortly after I arrived, Lori was there to greet me. It was my third stay in the studio suite and will book it again since my daughter lives a few blocks away. It is in a very safe, quiet, and lovely neighborhood. It is convenient  to downtown Ballard and many fine restaurants. 
The suite is cozy with everything you need.
I highly recommend it."
173896,36066837,2015-06-24,30564854,Colin,"This studio was a perfect little space to stay for a couple night! Clean, quiet and of course, in a fun part of the city. The hosts were great and provided a welcoming atmosphere when I arrived. I would highly recommend staying here"
173896,36574201,2015-06-29,35072191,Gail,This was my first airbnb. Lori was very nice and gave great advice on where to go. Our new favorite place was one she suggested at the Ballard Locks. She was very accommodating when I realized that I needed to schedule another night. I loved waking up to the sounds of the chickens and the horns of the boats on the Puget Sound. As I am a new airbnb user I didn't realize that the owners would check us in and then leave for a few days. So that is just a learning curve thing for me. Not altogether unpleasant but just unexpected. On her end she had to deal with a new airbnb user who didn't schedule the right number of nights. I miss Seattle already. New favorite place. 
173896,36908698,2015-07-02,21091689,Linda,"Lovely spot right along the 58th bike route.
The setting was very welcoming and we enjoyed sitting outside on the yard swing.
No bike rack but the tree worked great.
"
173896,37448630,2015-07-07,29414917,Marla,"Lori and Doug are friendly. The room is spacious for one, cozy for two, and they had cold beverages waiting for us in the mini fridge, which was lovely given that there was a heat wave in Seattle when we were there! Neighborhood is very walkable and very residential, with commercial district that has a wide range of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Views of Puget Sound and Ocean are also within walking distance, which is also a big bonus. Room was tidy upon our arrival, and Lori and Doug have thought of a lot of details that you would find in a traditional hotel room, like extra shampoo and soap, an electric kettle and supply of tea. Loved the chicken coop and listening to them coo and talk when people were around."
173896,38153016,2015-07-13,33585138,Julianne,"Everything was just as described: comfortable private studio in a nice and safe neighborhood. Doug and Lori provided a recommended list of places to eat, easy directions to the studio and were always prompt in their correspondences. This was my first time using airbnb and after this experience I will be using it more. I was a little concerned because I was traveling alone, but the neighborhood (Ballard) is very safe. I was in Seattle on a weekend and there was a street festival in Ballard which re-routed the buses and made commuting via public transportation difficult and lengthy – so I would recommend using taxi/uber. I also arrived late in the evening and was concerned about calling due to the time, but Lori was not bothered at all and was very pleasant to talk to."
173896,38435277,2015-07-15,37229041,Elena,This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were very pleased with the outcome. Doug and Lori were great hosts! Every little detail you could imagine was included- lots of maps and info about the city were provided as well as complimentary treats. The neighborhood was  peaceful and full of places to eat and drink. I would recommend this location to everyone. 
173896,38763053,2015-07-18,6333886,Emilio,"Lovely studio, good atmosphere and great help when in need from lovely hosts. Cozy location, easy access to all Seattle. Highly recommended "
173896,39792553,2015-07-26,4446077,Victoria,"Doug and Lori's pad is just great! It is a perfect little comfort zone, and so well located. Doug and Lori provided lots of helpful information and I found my now favourite new breakfast place globally :-) We had a great time, can only recommend it and will definitely be back :-)"
173896,40131620,2015-07-28,13796478,Allie,"My husband and I had the perfect little weekend getaway at Doug and Lori's studio. The location was great, super quick drive to the Ballard ave. and probably a pretty quick walk as well. The studio itself was very comfortable and was stocked with all the necessary amenities. They really thought of everything! Very much a home away from home. We never crossed paths with Doug and Lori during our stay, but kept in contact through messaging. Lori was super helpful in the weeks leading up to our stay with so many recommendations that made it super helpful and easy to venture out in a new area in Seattle. Would definitely love to come back sometime in the future! "
173896,41230363,2015-08-05,8416997,Julia,"A charming little studio, the sheets were soft, the water pressure was great, and the air flow from the sky light and window was so good that even with the record highs I didn't need to turn on the air. Doug and Lori had great food and travel suggestions, even dropping off a beach towel when the weather was unexpectedly hot. With the private entry they felt like friendly neighbors. Parking was effortless; with parks, coffee shops, and downtown Ballard an easy walk away (according to my FitBit their are a lot of hills). The wifi was great for planning the day ahead, and they helpfully included some maps of Ballard, Seattle, and some of the other neighborhoods."
173896,41970522,2015-08-10,29951449,Kevin,"The studio suite at Doug and Lori's was perfect for our trip.  As described in the listing, clean efficient and had everything we needed.  We spent the weekend checking out Ballard and downtown, parking was easy and the studio is very conveniently located.  We easily walked to the waterfront in Ballard.

We would definitely stay again!"
173896,42542935,2015-08-14,14362141,Rob,"Perfect place for us... this trip to Seattle was all about Ballard, Fremont & Magnolia, so if that's where you're going this is a great spot.
Close to everything, and enjoyed three walks to the beach.
Best:
R/S"
173896,43086691,2015-08-17,38159239,Helen,"The host provided detailed information before our arrival, had more detailed information in a binder (anticipating any possible questions with info about neighborhood, etc.) and greeted us shortly after our arrival.  This was our first airbnb experience and because it was such a positive one, we will be sure to continue with airbnb when we travel again."
173896,44172233,2015-08-24,1971733,Caroline,"Lori and Doug are very fine hosts and we enjoyed our stay in their studio!  We're Airbnb hosts too, and needed a place to stay while we rented out our own house.  The Sunset Hill neighbrhood is a great place to be: close to neighborhood greenways, Ballard, and the ocean, so we just were so happy to be in a nicely appointed studio so conveniently located!  "
173896,45288812,2015-09-01,39658456,Terra,Doug and Lori are great hosts! Their information and resources made it very easy to get down town and explore seattle. The studio its self is a very clean and a lovely place to stay.
173896,45573854,2015-09-04,6452792,Randy,"Doug and Lori were great hosts, unfortunately we never got to meet them face to face but that was never a problem. The room was comfy and clean, well located and just what we were looking for. Had a great time."
173896,45902425,2015-09-06,42719881,Lisa,"We had very minimal contact with Lori and Doug, but they were very sweet and the room was lovely. We stayed in several airbnb's while on vacation last week, and their bed was by far the most comfortable! It was totally private and we felt comfortable coming and going as needed. They had a very nice set up with anything you may have forgotten or didn't have room to pack (hair dryer, shampoo, soap, etc).  The room is detached from the house and has a full bathroom and mini fridge, but no kitchen. This wasn't a problem for us since seattle's amazing restaurants were part of the draw for our visit, but something to be aware of. They do however have an electric tea kettle, tea and instant coffee, which i thought was very convenient. I would definitely recommend staying with Doug and Lori, and would stay with them again! "
173896,46184448,2015-09-08,30935291,Brook,This was the perfect location for a girls get away. Had easy access to all the great activities Seattle's has to offer. 
173896,47075270,2015-09-15,7821268,Karin,The stay with Lori and Doug was Lovely! The room is nice and comforting in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to everything fun in Ballard! I also loved the (quiet) chickens in the garden! : ) Would stay here again.
173896,47513254,2015-09-19,42302471,Kate,"Stay was perfect!  The room is lovely and we had no trouble checking in or out.  The location is about 20/25 minutes from downtown Seattle, but there is a cute low-key downtown area with shops and food less than 5 minutes away.  It was very peaceful and the Doug and Lori were gracious and responsive hosts!"
173896,47857324,2015-09-21,42731784,Melissa,"Our experience was wonderful! It was clean, bright and cozy in Doug and Lori's studio. It was easy to find and my son loved talking to the chickens. Our next trip to Seattle we will for sure be staying here again. "
173896,49797651,2015-10-06,28622739,Ariel,"It was really nice! Perfect size for two people. Very nice accommodations. The location was good, within walking distance of everything in Ballard and very close to bus stops to get downtown and anywhere else. The bathroom included a little 'oops I forgot box' it had any toiletries you could think of. Very thoughtful of the owners to have that. We had a great time!  "
173896,51391003,2015-10-19,46259090,Paul,"This is a great place to stay if you're looking for a quiet place to get some sleep in town. It was very private and pleasant. I didn't get to meet Doug and Lori, but for some it may be a plus to have some alone time."
173896,52860539,2015-11-02,42065435,Mary,"Everything I needed & then some.
The room is stocked w/ great books on local history as well as current points of interest. Also teas, coffee,  wifi, lots of towels, & a small fridge with drinks.  More than I'd expect.
Cozy & quiet inside as well as outside. The neighborhood was quiet & felt safe & plenty of well lit street parking, unlike many area neighborhoods.
The sink/cabinet upgrade gives more counter space as well as drawers for necessities. Oh & the basket of ""I forgots"" !  Yea I did, thanks !  I am so glad I've already made reservations for the rest of my dates "
173896,53914324,2015-11-14,47558405,Michael,Great place. Very privat with own bathroom and a small fridge. Doug & Lori have done a lot to make the place varm and cozy with pillows and books to read on a rainy day. Better than described. Very close to puplic transports and besides being very friendly our host was so kind to provide us with travel plans to and from the airport. Highly recommended. Looking forward to my next stay with Doug & Lori.
173896,54770720,2015-11-23,22616789,Cherami And Scott,"Doug and Lori have a sweet alley studio. It was a squeeze with our son in his pack n play but they made it cozy! Heated floors, hot showers, space heater, comfy robes, great light, and refreshments made the inside special. Our son loved the chickens and we loved the quiet location. Doug and Lori were very pleasant and accommodating. Thank you!"
173896,55902532,2015-12-07,42065435,Mary,"Cozy & quiet, all the local literature makes me wish to come back when I'm not on business so I can go exploring. I LOVE that there's NO TV "
173896,56761231,2015-12-17,41939705,Hayley,comfy cozy and clean as can be! might have to return when I need an escape again as I felt utmost relaxation at Lori and Doug's. thanks guys!!
2471659,17383454,2014-08-11,5950681,Susan,"I loved staying here.  The house is composed of many repurposed elements in a very artistic and creative way.  Everything was well thought out to make the stay very comfortable.  Super clean, fridge stocked with cold drinks, coffee and french coffee press!  Beautiful cross breeze in bedroom with windows open.  Amazing efficient table fans..(they don't make them like that anymore). Dishwasher, washer and dryer, all of which I didn't use but nice to know they were there.  A close walk to the airlink station and also a close walk to Columbia City.  The bed super comfortable and the bathroom was great!  I will always try to stay here when in Seattle."
2471659,17581618,2014-08-14,5377699,Susie,"We had a great experience staying in this cool little spot! It's like having your own cabin, secluded in the city. It was impeccably clean, cozy, comfortable and thoughtfully decorated. The host was very communicative before and after our stay, and respected our privacy during our trip. Some snacks were provided, and you have all the amenities of home - nice clean linens, some toiletries, cable tv - and an added perk was the wrap around deck on the second level! Will definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle!"
2471659,17868466,2014-08-18,19008452,Quyen,"The place was as described, its very quaint and cozy with a nice rustic vibe to it. We definitely enjoyed our stay here. The neighborhood is not the nicest looking, but it is quiet and a quick walk to the train station as well as ""downtown"" Columbia City where this was an array of ethnic foods and shops."
2471659,18084337,2014-08-21,6489063,Leigh,"Hi Lindsay was a great host.  She made it an easy no-hassle check in/out.  Plus the cottage itself felt inviting with its cozy charm and interesting architectural features (great contrast).   It was big enough for two people to be comfortable and it was great fun just to be there .  One thing, our baggage was delayed and Lindsay made sure someone was on the property to receive it.  What a bonus.  We definitely will come back and only wish whoever updated the place would come to work for us in California."
2471659,18149107,2014-08-22,18276142,Cindy,"I absolutely loved this place!!! It was a charming, cozy urban cottage that made me feel like I was staying at an old friend's place.  I loved all of the thoughtfully composed details with repurposed building materials.
Communication with Lindsay went well- she got back to me right away and made sure I was all set up.
My only regret is that I only was there for one night and would have loved to stay longer!"
2471659,18365161,2014-08-25,19841094,Paul,"Great off-beat space. Really neat decorations, close to great coffee and bakery. Convenient to Downtown and plenty of parks. Our host left us beer and bottled water, with some snacks. The bed was comfortable. Great communication, check-in & check out was a breeze. We will definitely look here first when we come back for a visit!"
2471659,18897212,2014-09-02,7354398,Jesse,"The place was more cozy and inviting than we could've imagined. Lindsey had the place spotless for our arrival. Instructions on how to enter the place were clear, and she was communicative and quickly responded to our questions.

The picture displayed doesn't do the inside justice. The place is very charming, a lot of thought went into making it comfortable and memorable. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was stocked with much of what we needed, and there were even a few beers in the fridge.

Since I grew up in the neighborhood, I was familiar with the area and with what to expect. Street parking was readily available, and, so long as you practice smart and safe parking, your car will be fine.

The only slight critique I might offer would be that the place place has plenty of foliage and dark corners, which makes it prone to spiders and the like, especially around this wet, cold time. I dispatched a few spiders during our stay.

Outside of that, this place and the host were both absolutely wonderful. I may incorporate a bit of her interior design in our own place!"
2471659,19098616,2014-09-06,8902530,Katie,"I cannot recommend Lindsay's place enough. It is cosy, artful, well designed, tastefully decorated... It's everything I look for in a home away from home. There are great touches such as a harmonizing tea kettle, bath salts and a lovely porch with a beautiful view. Lindsay as a host was very communicative and got back to me right away with any questions I had. I will most definitely stay here again when I'm back in Seattle!"
2471659,19148907,2014-09-07,20066909,Matthew,"- Immensely creative space - you'll enjoy looking at all the architectural details!
- Awesome patio to enjoy a morning coffee / dinner.
- Full kitchen! 
- Close to downtown Columbia City.
- Close to rail transportation."
2471659,19538013,2014-09-14,1639040,Marcus,"I was blown away by how accurate the house was and then some. Absolutely perfect. Neighborhood is somewhat up and coming and really really wonderful. Very chill, which is what i wanted.. i could have stayed much longer and written a novel:)"
2471659,19664163,2014-09-15,19778640,Rebecca,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2471659,19704517,2014-09-16,20974867,Sam,"This house is amazing--private, beautiful, comfortable, cool, and Lindsay is a perfect host. I've already booked the house again for my next trip to Seattle."
2471659,19903364,2014-09-20,3265561,Christopher,"This place is unbelievable - full of great design objects (but not overloaded), handcrafted to the very detail, and just absolutely inspiring! The space is used so well, it even feels bigger than it actually is. Thumbs up for a really unique and beautiful place! This is why we LOVE AirBnB!"
2471659,20036118,2014-09-22,8879071,Renee,"What a fun little house! I liked all the plants, and fun decor. I couldn't tell from the pictures, but the bathtub is really big. Great for a nice relaxing soak!"
2471659,20246164,2014-09-26,20650066,Erin,Fantastic first Airbnb experience. The house was gorgeous and we couldn't stop singing its praises. Super close to everything and Columbia City has some great options as well.  Wish we could have stayed longer :) Hope to be back soon. Thank you so much for all of your thoughtfulness!
2471659,21013689,2014-10-09,21981497,Allison,"Fantastic, comfortable, clean, convenient and creative space! Lindsay was a wonderful host and a great communicator. I will definitely plan on staying again next time I'm in Seattle! "
2471659,21346550,2014-10-15,3541090,Stefania,We really enjoyed staying at Lindsay's. The place is really out of the ordinary and has all the comforts. We appreciated the green approach and creative reuse of the most disparate objects. On top of this the house was very clean and well kept. We will definitely try to book here again if we come back to Seattle!
2471659,21590129,2014-10-20,20853496,Sam,"The space was just as advertised: cozy, comfortable, and quiet. It is also convenient, near the train station and the Columbia City center. I felt like I had easy access for help if anything came up -- though of course nothing did. 

The interior design is also really fun. Lots of found furniture, and clearly thought through and curated. It made coming ""home"" very welcome. And the bed is really comfortable. I would totally stay here again.  "
2471659,21894657,2014-10-26,20974867,Sam,"I've stayed at this house 3 times in the last month and love it. The space is cool, comfortable, private, and well maintained. Gerrit and Ann are great. I'll be staying here frequently. "
2471659,22042797,2014-10-28,5671486,Decoteau,"Wow! Completely charming and perfectly decorated. I wanted to move in immediately! 
The house has every needed amenity and mixed together a great combination of vintage charm with modern comfort. 
I will look forward to staying here again. "
2471659,22719152,2014-11-12,23304234,Mike,"
The cleaning fee was put to efficient use as we stepped through the door and were greeted with an immaculate apartment right from the get-go. 

Gerrit & Ann have decorated their place with such a uniquely warm touch - different carpet textures, photos large and small, and a green thumb all lend themselves to culminate in a home that allows you to feel right at ease... at your home away from home! 

It's a nice way to explore a different side of Seattle, not living right at the downtown core.

"
2471659,23439135,2014-12-01,3989527,Kyle,"Fantastic space. quiet and cozy. Very clean, exactly as advertised."
2471659,23617881,2014-12-06,24411119,Page,Wonderful and unique place that was exactly as described.  Thanks so much to Gerrit and Ann for providing me with this sanctuary for a couple of days.
2471659,24000428,2014-12-16,23832374,Amrit,"We had a wonderful time. Loved the recycled theme!! The bed was VERY comfortable, usually my biggest issue while traveling.  

We made breakfast and packed lunches, there was plenty of kitchen appliances and pots/pans. 

"
2471659,25345763,2015-01-12,5256730,Ben,"This is an incredibly unique place to stay. The attention the detail and creativity that was put into this home blew us away.  Very clean, comfortable and in a good location.  Anne and Gerrit were very accommodating and promptly responded to all questions. I would definitely recommend and looking forward to visiting this spot again soon. "
2471659,25688977,2015-01-23,25593229,Jeannie,"This was my first airbnb experience and it went better than imagined. The house is a mystical getaway, perfectly situated around everything you could need. The pictures don't show near as much charm and character as this little retreat. Leaving was a very hard experience. "
2471659,25828742,2015-01-26,11666839,Tara,"House was as described, and the restaurants that they suggested were great."
2471659,25939971,2015-01-30,8902530,Katie,Another perfect stay! I love this place and will definitely keep coming back whenever I am on town. It's so cozy and comfortable!
2471659,26072581,2015-02-02,4510258,Katherine,"What a sweet getaway that's walking distance to many great restaurants and bars, but quiet and residential. We loved the reclaimed and recycled materials, especially the steel slab in the kitchen and the bathroom chandelier. It met our needs and exceeded our expectations. We did miss out on coffee our first morning, bought some to leave behind, but took it home with us because Seattle makes good coffee! Sorry!! We enjoyed the other touches, like the fruit and the basket of Trader Joe goodies.  Looking forward to a summer visit so we can use the deck!"
2471659,26789293,2015-02-19,26591349,Aundra,"The description of the place was spot on - a charming little rustic hide away that was cute and intimate perfect for two people who like spending time with one another. The bed was even more comfortable then the one in my own home and if you plan on making bacon be sure to open the windows or the whole place will smell like it - it's tiny. Although the house is right up against another house, we were never disturbed. We didn't spend much time in Colombia City but it looks like a really cool neighborhood. The location was super close to the LINK and bus stops but it did require a pretty lengthy bus ride to the city which is important to keep in mind if you are traveling solely via public transportation. Overall, we loved our stay at The Rusty Gate and would stay there again! "
2471659,27097592,2015-02-25,7507564,Steve,"Wonderful, funky house.  We loved the use of recycled materials throughout the house.  It was very comfortable and was as described. Great location close the the main streets and businesses.  Also convenient to the light rail station which we used to go both downtown and to the airport."
2471659,27298866,2015-03-01,28178179,Kevin,"Communication about everything (amenities, parking, keys, lights, WiFi, etc...) was clear and lightning fast.  And the place is amazing.  Super comfortable, clean, and stylish.  I travel a lot and it was so refreshing to not be in a cliche hotel room.  I will definitely try to stay here again if I ever find myself in Seattle."
2471659,27740860,2015-03-10,28471964,Maryellen," House was a wonderful eclectic aesthetic mix created from what looks to be recycled materials, with most amenities one would want. Neighborhood was fine, quiet at residence but restaurants and shops close.
Note to those over 60, like me, the circular narrow uneven steps to the bedroom make getting a suitcase up and down a bit awkward and a chair to be able to sit in would also be welcome. It was worth the money."
2471659,28127746,2015-03-18,14140933,Dan,"Gerrit and Ann's place is something special.  Everything about it is so unique and different.  The design is very eclectic, but it all goes together perfectly.  It's a mix of antique, industrial, and luxury.  The retreat is self-contained behind their home, so you don't have to tiptoe around.  The ground floor has a full kitchen with bar stools, washer/dryer, and a seating area (futon & coffee table).  We were provided with a variety of snacks, but didn't consume much.  This was due to us eating just about everything in the city.  When you make your way upstairs, you will find the bedroom and bathroom.  The mattress is memory foam and very comfortable.  We really liked the industrial sliding door for the bathroom.  Right outside the bedroom is a wrap-around balcony to take in some fresh air.  

It was also very clean! :)

The neighborhood was very nice and quiet, just far enough away from downtown.  We had a rental car, but the light rail is just a short walk away.  You can take it direct to downtown and the airport.  

Communication with Gerrit and Ann was a breeze and ""check-in"" was easy.  We were provided with our own lockbox code to acquire our keys.  

All in all, we had a wonderful time at their beautiful guest retreat and would definitely recommend it to anyone/everyone.  There's no need to look anywhere else!"
2471659,28314196,2015-03-22,18832183,Will,"Great time in Seattle due to this place! Very comfortable, spacious enough for 2 and the bed was fantastic. Coldest Water Ever. Named one of the chickens Jared, saw him every morning as he was my alarm clock. Wish the ""pocket closet"" had a light but nothing horrible. Amazing place, thank you!"
2471659,29172213,2015-04-05,16150788,Mike,"Ann and Gerrit were excellent hosts.
The space was clean,comfortable, and quiet.
Bed was comfy. Location was perfect for us. Our daughter, son in law, and Grandchild are just a few blocks away.
We will be back."
2471659,29507285,2015-04-08,29042361,Kalie,"Gerrit and Ann's place is an amazing little gem in Seattle! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The Rusty Gate is close to major roads and we were able to access West Seattle, downtown and a couple other areas easily. The Rusty Gate itself is welcoming, cozy and so comfortable - the kitchen was tiny but worked perfectly. We would readily recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet place in Seattle to rest up and re-charge. Gerrit and Ann were even flexible with check-in time and didn't mind letting us stop by early and settle in. 10/10!"
2471659,29753453,2015-04-12,29050722,Dan,"We are in love with this place! So comfortable, you instantly feel right at home. The decor is amazing and it's a joy to walk around and discover all of the details. The hosts have thought of every detail you might need for your stay. Just a few blocks from amazing food and quiet shopping and great neighbors to explore! Whole heartedly recommend staying here when you visit Seattle. We will be back!"
2471659,30243131,2015-04-19,8614940,Rachael,Loved loved loved this space - it was so cute and quiet and convenient. Ann was a great host and I hope to make it back!! 
2471659,30433849,2015-04-21,31356607,Will,"This place was amazing. Safe neighborhood, great view. Not to mention that the place itself was masterfully put together. Easily the coolest place I have ever stayed. The hosts left out snacks and info about nearby places to eat, which was very thoughtful, and going a step beyond the average airbnb. My highest recommendation to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle."
2471659,31347312,2015-05-04,21621806,Hector,Everything was exactly as we expected! The hosts made it easy to find the entrance and answered my questions. We had a great memorable time at the Rusty Gate and we'd stay again. 
2471659,32302955,2015-05-16,9761273,Charles,Amazing place.
2471659,32470091,2015-05-18,13720441,Liz,This apartment exceeded all my expectations! Definitely one of the coolest airbnb's I've ever stayed at. Every detail of the house was so cute and my boyfriend and I had trouble leaving the place to go explore because we were so cozy. Would definitely come back anytime we are in Seattle :)
2471659,33030950,2015-05-24,28375455,Jonathan,"Our stay was wonderful! The rustic theme provided for a very cozy experience. Amenities were great, the location was close enough to downtown Seattle, and the hosts were very quick to respond when communicating. Awesome first experience using airbnb!"
2471659,33336294,2015-05-26,14244380,Nic,"The was absolutely awesome! Two nights was not nearly long enough to spend in the little oasis just minutes away from Downtown Seattle. The craftsmanship is phenomenal and time clearly spent in creating the home is amazing. I would be happy to move in a live forever in this home. As a first timer using Airbnb, I think the bar has been set incredibly high. I will definitely come back again for future trips to the Seattle area."
2471659,33811087,2015-06-01,31813478,Kate,"Ann & Gerrit made us feel so welcome by not only opening their AMAZINGLY unique place to us, but by going the extra step and leaving snacks! We were blown away by how great the space was. Very comfortable, clean, and just overall a cool experience. Very secluded and relaxing."
2471659,34139633,2015-06-05,31610777,Manqiao,"This place was very special. You could read the owner's thoughts in every detail of the house which They masterfully put together.  The house was very clean. No problem with the communication. The hosts left out snacks and info about nearby places to eat, which was very thoughtful, and going a step beyond the average airbnb. "
2471659,34625691,2015-06-10,29330158,Julie,"We arrived from the uk to 29 degree heat in Columbia City at what was approximately 2am uk time (6pm in Seattle). We were really happy to find this little oasis where we could relax, catch up on some sleep and use as a base for exploring the city.  The flat was just as shown in the photos, very quirky and with all amenities we could have wanted during our three night stay. The balcony running around three sides was a bonus.  
The flat is about a ten minute walk to the light rail which takes you into Seattle centre and also to the airport, this makes a stay here really convenient.  We really enjoyed coming back to Columbia City in the evenings, we would recommend the Columbia City ale house and the Thai restaurant for food.  There is a bakery on the Main Street which was brilliant for breakfast.
We would definitely recommend a stay here!"
2471659,34961295,2015-06-14,26118485,Cidra,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We started off with booking the wrong days and Gerrit and Ann were very helpful and quick to respond with the changes. We appreciated the snacks left for us upon arrival and everything about our stay was well thought out and all directions were easy to follow. The place itself was very clean and all the detail and decor was awesome. Overall, we had a great experience and would love to stay again in the future! Thanks :)"
2471659,35662986,2015-06-21,32087457,Spencer,"This was my wife and I's first Airbnb experience.  My wife and I stayed for three nights at Gerrit and Ann's unique home, and each night we fell more in love with the place. It is a truly unique and beautiful place! 
Gerrit and Ann allowed us to check in early upon our arrival, something that usually doesn't happen.  When we walked in the spotless.  They left a welcome bowl of snacks, and a few drinks in the fridge, which my wife and I were super pumped about.  The bathroom was fully stocked with clean towels, and it even had shampoo!
During our stay, My wife and I took a look in a little leather bound book that was left in the living room.  It was filled with menus and information about the area.  It obviously took some time to pull together, My wife and I were impressed at the care and forethought.  If you get the chance be sure to check it out.
Gerrit and Ann are very cordial and easy to contact, their home is amazing! "
2471659,36270447,2015-06-27,30196629,Söhnke,"A great and unique place to stay and very friendly hosts. Thank you a lot, it was a fine first Airbnb experience for me! :-)"
2471659,36867051,2015-07-02,32008579,Jenny,"We were given very good directions on accessing the space.  The place itself was comfy and eclectic.  The loft space with bedroom and bath was very cozy.  The snacks were a nice touch, as were the high end toiletries. The neighborhood was a nice surprise, being as diverse and historic as it was.  I would definitely stay again if given the opportunity. Thank you for offering such a great space."
2471659,37084160,2015-07-04,35833014,Florian,Nice and very welcoming and of course unique place. It was definitely a great stay. Very recommendable.
2471659,37310127,2015-07-06,30870323,Candice,The home was very true to the listing and nice. It was fun to look at everything. We loved the thought put into the building and decor. The neighborhood wasn't as nice as I thought it would be.  It was a little rough on the walk from the light rail. Especially since we arrived at night and one of the intersections wasn't well lite to figure out which road to take. There were some treats left for us which was great. There is an a/c unit in the bedroom that we were very happy to have since it was in the 90's. I wish we would have choosen to have a car for this visit. There seemed to be space to park.
2471659,37744970,2015-07-10,7432732,Chris,"This place is a work of art.  Amazing design and decor, clever use of reclaimed materials and comfy, well-appointed surroundings all made for a very enjoyable stay.  The deck is secluded and peaceful and ideal for relaxing in the evening.  The place is so well set up that we didn't have much need to contact the host, but when we had a minor issue with a key on arrival, Ann responded right away and the issue was resolved.  We really loved the breakfast options in Columbia City (the bakery is incredible) and took advantage of these before catching the light rail to downtown Seattle.  The walk from the light-rail stop to the space is a bit of a trek, but this was only notable walking back at the end of a day of walking around Seattle (it was in the 90's during our stay which made the small hill seem more like a mountain).  Much appreciated the AC unit in the bedroom area.  Highly recommended."
2471659,38392896,2015-07-15,33396638,David,"We received an email about a week before our arrival with the information we needed.  The house was very neat and clean with everything we needed for a lovely ending to our two week visit to Washington.  Of particular note was the lovely balcony, perfect for a cool evening or morning breakfast.  The bed was very comfortable.  The kitchen was well equipped for any need.  It is within 9 miles of the Seattle airport which made it easy for our morning departure.  The house is very unique and we would love to know more about its construction as there was much use of recycled items throughout.  Overall, our first Airbnb experience was very satisfying.  We will try it again."
2471659,39181531,2015-07-21,17148396,Jennifer,Accommodations as described. Very unique property. We enjoyed sitting on the deck in the evenings. We were there for a bit of a heat wave but the a/c cooled things down nicely. It's a bit of a trek to the train but do-able-- though we were there mostly on the weekend so we could drive and park downtown easily (about 10-15 minutes away).
2471659,39461572,2015-07-23,4284864,Jason & Kimbrie,"WHERE to start...what an AMAZING home!!! The hosts were quick to communicate but respected our privacy 110% We spent the first 30 minutes marveling at it all, then sat on the beautiful deck! The home was clean, quiet, and the repurposed materials used in such a way the home felt modern and upscale...luxurious large tub didn't hurt either!!!

Thanks Ann & Gerrit we WILL stay again!"
2471659,39920709,2015-07-27,8348897,Sundance,"We really enjoyed our stay at Gerrit and Ann's Airbnb. The apartment was beautiful and functional, with tons of smartly thought out design elements and a comfortable, usable space.

The location is great, with a short walk to excellent food and shopping, and the apartment is located close to both light rail and the bus system.

I'd highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Seattle. "
2471659,40240537,2015-07-29,8190224,Kailey,"We had an excellent time in Seattle thanks to Gerrit and Ann! The place was exactly as we expected--clean, quaint, easy to find, and so unique! I would highly recommend the house, neighborhood and area in general. Absolutely amazing all around! "
2471659,41212687,2015-08-05,13039934,James,"The house was exactly as advertised and ideal for my needs. Whoever designed and decorated the property (inside and out) is a genius. Neighborhood was quiet, parking was easy, train was very accessible. The bed was comfortable and all appliances seemed brand new. I really couldn't have asked for a better experience."
2471659,42382826,2015-08-13,12720239,Paul,"My wife & I were guests for a week in town with friends & family to visit and a fun stuff to do list.  This place served us well as a result.  Its a funky and functional space in a mixed neighborhood.  Interior upstairs and downstairs contained everything needed with enough space to take a few paces and turn around.  It is a solid walk of 15"" to the light rail station (uphill coming back).  There are no stores close by.  Hosts left a few snacks for us.  Would suggest:  Better cookware (only one pan), replace coffeepot (not reliable), provide soap for guests (not a bottle of hand pump liquid soap only), and maybe keep a little bit of coffee and creamer around (we left some for the next guests).  Overall a positive experience for us.  Our hosts made it easy for us and were responsive."
2471659,43364645,2015-08-19,33239991,Marlena,"The hospitality was great -- thanks for the snacks! The air conditioning unit came in clutch in the heat. Overall, it's a cozy and eclectic place that was close to public transit and not an unreasonable Lyft/Uber ride away from downtown."
2471659,44414259,2015-08-26,34181157,Pádraig,"Gerrit and Ann's accommodation was a lovely place to call home for 3 days. The place was clean and tidy, with lots of features throughout the house. Great to have the washing facilities too. The light link rail station in to downtown was about 10-15mins walk, which was convenient. Thanks guys!"
2471659,45636351,2015-09-04,16393966,John,This is such an awesome place to stay.  Everything is as advertised and more.  Very clean and unique place to stay.  Link station is close by and made a trip downtown quick and easy.
2471659,45786512,2015-09-06,22628713,Janine And Rachel,"Staying here was absolutely lovely! The house was very clean, tastefully and very creatively decorated, and had everything we needed to make for a cozy stay in Seattle.  We loved it so much, we found it hard to motivate ourselves to go out! The neighborhood was really interesting fun to explore - Geraldine's is fantastic - do not miss it! The link train was indeed within walking distance and made for very easy commutes into/out of downtown. Parking in the neighborhood was no problem.  We loved it and will absolutely stay here again next time we are in Seattle!"
2471659,46283596,2015-09-09,20607350,Sylvie,"Gerrit and Ann's cottage was a perfect retreat after the hustle and celebration of our wedding.  It is beautifully and creatively decorated with just the right mix of funky vibes and classy comfort.  Gerrit and Ann were welcoming and helpful with our questions.  We'd highly recommend as a comfortable, unique place to stay in Seattle.  "
2471659,46471746,2015-09-11,34745844,Clare,We had a lovely stay in the charming and quirky accommodation . It was warm and welcoming and a great base to explore Seattle . We highly recommend staying there . 
2471659,47143185,2015-09-16,7507564,Steve,"This is the second time we stayed at Gerrit and Ann's house and we enjoyed it again this time.  We appreciated the room air conditioner.  Our last visit was in February so an air conditioner was not necessary.  However, it was warm this trip and it was nice to have it.  Thanks for everything!"
2471659,47511332,2015-09-19,2742285,Carolina,"a really nice rental. the house is an architectional masterpiece, we really enjoyed all of the details. nice neighbourhood and an easy drive to downtown. would totally recommend this place! aaaand the most cozy bed EVER! "
2471659,47997582,2015-09-22,39960176,Andy,"What can I say? Wow! Gerri and Ann's place is just as they described. The decor made you feel like you were in a cabin in the hills. My first time using Airbnb and they made our experience a wonderful one. Ann's communication was open and made things a lot simple. The area is close to everything and close to a few spots in Columbia City. If I get the chance to go back to Seattle and if Gerrit and Ann's place is available, I'll make sure I stay there again. Two GREAT big thumbs up on my end."
2471659,48317331,2015-09-25,28249909,Amanda,"The Rusty Gate is by far the coolest place I have ever stayed! Every little detail was perfect. We had all of the amenities we needed, including a bowl of snacks and some drinks in the fridge! Thoughtful touches like these made our stay extra special. I couldn't stop marveling at the decor. The deck was also adorable, and we had a lovely view of the neighborhood! I would recommend this place to anyone. The Columbia City rail stop was also just a 15 minute walk away! "
2471659,48817923,2015-09-28,16476935,Jocelyn,Great place to stay in Seattle! Very interesting decor and very clean. We would definitely stay here on future visits to Seattle:)
2471659,49646787,2015-10-05,20240992,Kelli,"We had a lovely stay at this cottage, which can only be described as a labor of love and a work of art. The little details and repurposed ""junk"" was so neat and thoughtful. The snacks were a nice touch as well. :)"
2471659,50276023,2015-10-11,1815347,Ann,This unique abode had everything that we needed as well as loads of personality.  We took the light rail from the train station and were happy to walk into such a creative and delightful environment.  It is exactly as pictured in the listing and very comfortable also.  We walked to the light rail each day to explore Seattle and felt no hesitation late at night when walking back from the light rail station.  It was aso fun to explore Columbia City a bit.
2471659,51327745,2015-10-19,20974867,Sam,This is my favorite air bnb in the country.
2471659,52415452,2015-10-29,24427741,Kanokwan,"The ambience was beautiful. I stayed there for 8 days, and each day I found something new about the house. There was so much detail put into the house, that it was like a scavenger hunt every day. I would find crystals in areas I didnt think to look, I just stumbled across them. The house made me feel like I was in a secluded resort. I had privacy, and at the same time I was in an area that was close to everything. I definitely felt welcomed. thank you so much being accommodating. Everything was prefect! "
2471659,55938889,2015-12-07,27608127,Richard,"What an interesting,  comfortable,  beautiful  space. Private, an upstairs, useable deck (with territorial view!), and more amenities  (w/d, full kitchen, full size fridge  ) than I've  experienced in comparable  spaces.  Comfortable to stay in, rather than just sleep in.  Close to transit, a cinch to get downtown or the airport.  Gerrit & Ann have stocked the the place with all kinds of visitor info, including menu's and information  for nearby restaurants, plus some snacks to get you started! You'll  be surprised  for the better, not the worst. Stay here!"
2471659,56545900,2015-12-14,12474472,Chelsea,"What an awesome place! Cute, close to Columbia City, comfy bed. I'll refer to friends and family and continue to use for in town get-a-ways!

Thanks! "

260613,964312,2012-03-02,1675943,Jeffrey,"The Location: Slightly North of Ballard - but very easy to access. The apartment is roughly a three minute walk to the bus stop for route 28 - affording easy access to Downtown Seattle. On street parking is readily available in this quiet neighborhood.

The Apartment: Modern and clean. It is accurately depicted in the description and the images. The space is open and has a small alcove for the sleeping area. All appliances and fixtures are new and in excellent condition. The bathroom is top-notch with a heated floor. There is a washer and dryer available in the shared space outside the apartment. FYI - I am 6FT tall and the low ceiling doesn't bother me at all.

The Host: Monika has been very responsive and is easy to get in touch with. She has extensive knowledge of the Seattle area and is very helpful with advice about restaurants, bars, and shopping. Extremely helpful, very friendly, and very accommodating.

Extras: Fresh herbs are available in the backyard. There is a bike available to borrow."
260613,2469792,2012-10-01,3456864,Thomas,"The apartment was ideal for us--location, accommodations, host, parking,etc. It is new and tastefully decorated and has complete kitchen and laundry (latter shared) facilities. Everything appears brand new and is comfortable and clean, and quiet. There is a private (Illuminated) entrance through a coded garage door (no key needed). Plenty of close street parking (safe). The apartment is 1 1/2 blocks from an express bus stop to downtown and Green Lake is 5-10 min. by car.

Most impressive was the attitude and hospitality of the host. She made us feel welcome and was eager to help with information, directions and advice. She even loaned us coins for bus fare for exact change to avoid extra fare charge. When returning home at night we frequently found treats, such as pie, soft drinks, and there was a welcome bottle of wine and cookies.

The kitchen is also clean and fully equipped, but we didn't use it. The bathroom was also clean and kept that way daily. 4 stars out of 4.

P.S. There is a backyard to use, but we didn't have time to use it."
260613,6827283,2013-08-26,5926213,Pamela,"Staying at Monika's in Ballard was Fantastic! We were either dreaming or this was HGTV come to life (only better because We actually got to stay here and not deal with hard hats ;-)). We did not see much of Monika as she works and is very involved with the local art community.  We kept contact via smart phones. She is a very warm, inviting, bubbly, and humorous hostess. She left sweet care packages for us upon arrival and a note of welcoming. We were able to leave Mighty O French Toast donuts for her and her sweet partner, Myles. 
The apartment is very beautifully appointed, modern contemporary, and clean. Great use of space with smart use of windows and light, adorable furnishings, reading materials, touristy guides and local places to eat (we loved Olive and Grape, and Razzi's (Gluten Free) pizza. The 4 Spoons was delightful!) art pieces made for a sweet stay. I loved the deep tub and shower-excellent water pressure. Monika has excellent design sense with color, shape, and form. She has made wise choices in using compact size appliances that maximize the size of the space. We also had respectful se of the laundry which we found helpful.
I appreciated the ability to separate landfill, recycling, and compost. 
The ceilings are low so if you are a tall person you might not like that. We had no problems.
A very special experience for us to stay 4 nights Monika's."
260613,16707598,2014-08-01,2199831,Jane,"The apartment was delightful--nicely decorated and immaculately clean.  The location was perfect.  There are so many fun things to do in Ballard.  The apartment is within a block of the bus stop so getting downtown via bus was very easy.  We were able to bicycle directly from the garage to access great bike lanes/trails.  The kitchen was nicely equipped.  We cooked several meals there; appliances and kitchen equipment were new and high quality.

Monica was very helpful--provided music event and bus information before we arrived.  Welcome package included wine, fruit, chocolate, and various snacks.  We were in the apartment for three weeks, and having the washer and dryer and access to the garage was wonderful.  Our requests and questions were answered very quickly, but we always felt a complete sense of privacy.

Best vacation I've ever had.  Many thanks!"
260613,17304321,2014-08-10,18688556,Jochen,Monika was very friendly and helpful. She gave me many recommendations around the neighborhood and the city which made it easy for me to find nice things to do. The apartment is very clean and is nicely decorated and the neighborhood seems safe. Overall it was a pleasure to live there.
260613,25924187,2015-01-30,23437061,Jan,"Monika and Miles made us feel very welcome.  The little apartment is darling, very well appointed.  Any issues that arose were dealt with by M and M promptly and courteously.  Highly recommend our hosts and the apartment!"
260613,34945537,2015-06-14,26231344,Rauldon,"My girlfriend and I are both travel nurses and we came to Washington from NY for work. We spent a month in Monika's place and it was a great experience. The apartment is clean and has all the essentials for an extended stay. She was kind enough to have treats for us in the kitchen when we arrived. The kitchen has plenty of dishes/utensils and there are a lot of cleaning supplies already there to get us started. She was also nice enough to have plenty of towels in the bathroom.  The bedroom includes cable t.v. =) The location is also very nice.  Her home is  close to many great places to eat, supermarkets, bike trails (just to name a few things). Monika is a sweetheart and was very easy to get in touch with, if needed.  Overall, lovely experience."
260613,35683298,2015-06-21,22508784,Roy,"Miles was very accommodating and responsive as our arrival ended up being late evening arrival which was greatly appreciated!  The apartment is accurately described; very nicely appointed and spotlessly clean.  The location was excellent for us and provided easy access to Seattle and other areas around the city.  We did a fair amount of walking in the mornings and found many great restaurants within a radius of several blocks.  The neighborhood felt very safe and plenty of street parking was available.

Thanks Monika and Miles!"
260613,36429733,2015-06-28,9721575,Lelsey,"Great stay!  Fast and clear communication with very helpful host, space is clean and new.  Kitchen is beautiful.  Quiet residential neighborhood.  

Space feels a little tight (skinny kitchen) for two people with luggage (we didn't stay long enough to unpack).

Description is accurate, although I didn't notice that the only entrance to the apartment is actually through a car garage door - it was fine, though."
260613,37487339,2015-07-07,7759928,Patrick,"The apartment was a perfect base for my wife and me to explore Seattle, a city we've considered relocating to. The conveniently located neighborhood is quiet and residential, yet walking distance to a few pubs, restaurants, and small shops as well as bus routes for downtown and an Enterprise if you want to rent a car. The apartment is a a recent rehab/conversion with high quality appliances; new, clean, and well maintained. Kitchen is small, efficient, and well-stocked.  Ceiing is low but did not bother me at 5' 11"". "
260613,38597976,2015-07-17,32662512,Theresa,Felt very welcomed. Cozy and clean . Comfy bed. Would recommend it to friends. Monika was a gracious host. 
260613,39804861,2015-07-26,455546,Mike,We had a lovely stay. Monica had good restaurant recommendations. The apt is very nice
260613,42934935,2015-08-16,13006315,James,"Great location in Ballard in a quiet neighborhood. Monika was friendly and responsive but also gave us privacy. Nice to have a full kitchen, clean towels and soap. Comfortable bed. Lots of space for clothes/suitcases. Clean and tidy."
260613,44193893,2015-08-24,40539545,Cassandra,"Beautiful apartment! Part James Bond entrance and French Bistro ambiance once inside. Tasteful touches throughout. Enjoyed a deep soak in the tub. Monika is a gracious host, kind and easy to talk to. She had all kinds of suggestions for neighborhood restaurants, bars, etc. Location is excellent. Bed and furniture is comfy and cozy. The only downside I experienced was not their fault. I'm an extremely light sleeper and the mornings were a challenge for me. Most Seattle basement apartments have the bedrooms under the living room or other high traffic areas. Its just the way they are designed so any basement apartment may not be a good fit for you if you are an extremely light sleeper but frankly that is very rare. I'm sorry Monika I forgot to run the dishwasher on my last day! Thank you for a wonderful stay. "
260613,45151771,2015-08-31,1252862,Jay,"Monika's place was excellent! Super cozy and clean with easy entry and a fully stocked kitchen! Monika was very accommodating and flexible with our arrival times and checked in to see if everything was okay. 

Great location as well. Feels like the perfect home away from home. Would definitely stay here again!"
260613,47095465,2015-09-15,41008306,Kyle,"Ny wife and in spent a month stayibg here while I was working in the area. Our stay was a delightful experience. The apartment is very tastefully decorated with all amenities including an excellent laundry room just outside the apartment. It was quiet, conveniently located and just what we we needed for our extended stay.

Highly recommended! My only reservation would be for those on the tall side, the ceilings are probably not higher than 6'6"", so for me at 6'3"" I had to duck a good bit. While this didn't bother me personally,  I wouldn't recommend the place to anyone taller than I am. 

Great experience overall! Thanks Monika!"
260613,48320764,2015-09-25,41008306,Kyle,Great experience! It us our third time booking with Monika and we plan to stay here again whenever we are in the area. Highly recommended!
260613,56607149,2015-12-15,1605361,Hannah,We spent an incredible month in Monika's apartment. It has everything you need and then some. We couldn't have been more comfortable or happier anywhere else. The neighborhood has so many amazing restaurants and little shops to explore and Monika is more then helpful with advising places to explore. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much 
6657574,41036150,2015-08-03,622349,Josh,"Elizabeth is wonderful, welcoming and very accommodating.  The space and room is perfect, private and comfortable. And, the location is close to tons of fun stuff and minutes to Ballard, but a few minutes away that the location is quite. Highly recommended. "
6657574,43123733,2015-08-17,37628189,Elke,Elizabeth was a wonderful welcoming host. Very helpful with any questions I had.   A lovely quiet neighborhood. All round a great place to stay.  
6657574,44366291,2015-08-25,41117642,Tobias,"I really enjoyed staying at Elizabeth's place! Everything was super comfy and easy. The room is really beautiful and you'll get a lot of space and privacy. Elizabeth was always eager to help me out when I got questions or problems (e.g. forgot to buy some butter & salt) and if you wish to, you can have great and interesting conversations with her. The house, which is located in a lovely neighborhood, is perfectly clean and has a really beautiful view. Grocery Stores and more are within 10-15 Minutes walking distance and you got access to downtown with a cheap busride (2.25) which will take you there in about 45 minutes. Thank you so much,Elizabeth, for everything! The coughing-candies really helped me out! 

Ich habe meinen Aufenthalt bei Elizabeth sehr genossen! Sie ist eine grosszuegige und interessante Person. Alles war so einfach und ""heimelig'. Am ersten Tag, nach einer warmen Begruessung, bot sie mir an, mich zum Lebensmittelladen zu fahren, da ich doch muede sein muss, was, wie ich finde, fuer sich selbst spricht. Der Raum ist grosszuegig eingerichtet und man hat seine Privatsphaere, wenn man will. Man kann sich aber auch gut mir Elizabeth unterhalten oder einen Trip nach Downtown machen, was mit dem Bus ca. 45 Minuten Fahrtweg in Anspruch nimmt. Ihr Haus ist in einer schoenen, amerikanischen Wohnsiedlung und man hat einen wundervollen Ausblick von Ihrem Balkon. Ich kann dieses Angebot nur weiterempfehlen!"
6657574,45615542,2015-09-04,4672597,Kristopher,"The neighborhood was nice and quiet. Nearby food spots were interesting, groceries were accessible. The 5 was just a couple of minutes away. Parking directly in front of the address was easy.

Elizabeth was very eager to make me feel welcome. Fridge space was already available, coffee was offered, and the room was tidy.  She was very accommodating to the sometimes strange entering/leaving hours I held, and was happy to talk about the Pacific Northwest and life near the Puget Sound. Very friendly.

Windows on each side of the room allow for a strong breeze to pass over the bed - great for someone who enjoys it cold like I do. I didn't spend much time at her place during the day (work trip), but the living room was lovely and the deck a great spot to spend cold mornings.

The cat was very friendly too, when she was around!"
6657574,46081472,2015-09-07,2222064,Jenny,"Elizabeth was such a delight! I truly enjoyed being in her presence. He has such a positive energy and loves life. I was touched by her love for people, her interest area in life with her work in healing. The room is very warm and clean. The whole house have a calming energy and amazing sky view from the living room. I wish I could've stayed longer :)"
6657574,48019464,2015-09-22,43174987,Colleen,"I had great communication with Elizabeth before my visit and she was very welcoming upon my arrival and we chatted. She offered suggestions of places to visit and was very helpful. She also has a lovely cat, though I didn't see her very often. She also gas a nice deck to sit on and enjoy the outside views. The bed is also comfortable and the water pressure on the shower is fabulous. "
6657574,49178940,2015-10-01,15466027,Thomas,"I enjoyed my stay at Elizabeth's house immensely.  It was in a very quiet neighborhood which allowed me to get plenty of rest between my work shifts.  The room was large and accommodating, the bed was very comfortable, and most importantly the shower/bath had plenty of hit water, and allot of pressure.  I would stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.  Great Value!"
6657574,49834557,2015-10-06,1986958,Neil,"Elizabeth was very quick to contact me with information on the location, and a phone number to contact her with.  The pictures are accurate.  The neighborhood is very nice, quiet, with a park nearby which is used for woodland walks.  There is a parking space off the road right in front of the house.  There are restaurants and a small neighborhood shopping area on Greenwood Avenue which is about a half mile away.  The room was really nice, clean, had flannel sheets, with a thick comforter, and blanket.  This made sleeping really nice.  There was plenty of closet space, and she put out soap and shampoo for me to use on arrival.  Elizabeth is a generous host, and is very sincere in her care for the individual staying with her.  She allowed use of her washing machine, and everything was neat, clean, and tidy.  I would stay with her again when I travel to Seattle.  "
8943821,53139130,2015-11-05,27282225,Kellie,"Loida & her roommate, Phu, are lovely! Super accommodating and very generous. Phu even made chili! They share a beautiful home in a great location with easy access anywhere around town and parking right outside. They were both gracious enough to provide cute areas to wander off to and I'm looking forward to keeping in touch.  "
8943821,53313967,2015-11-07,15543526,Rachel And Paul,"Loida and her place are perfection. What a lovely, warm, comfy, safe stay I had. Loida was kind to not only accommodate me at the last minute, but also provide a later night check-in. The room was warm and beautifully lit, a comfy clean bed and a private barhroom. I slept like a baby. Parking was easy too. Loida couldn't have been sweeter and I'm so grateful for her hospitality. If you need a place to stay in Seattle,  don't hesitate to book this great room."
571651,9223016,2013-12-14,8027883,Luca,"Clean and nice room in Seattle. Just met Prez, he was friendly and helpful. Thanks."
571651,9356772,2013-12-23,8143601,David,It was a great accomodation! We had a lot of fun with Prez & Cherie. They drove us often to the trainstation and we were also at the grocery store with them. First day they cooked with us and we had a great dinner. The Room was very clean and fine - the bed was also very comfortable. There is only one thing which was not so good - there was no heater in the bathroom - and it was reaaaally cold (It was snowing in seattle) - but i think it's not a big deal and you can see over it - especially in the summer. Thank ya guys! Was a lot of fun! 
571651,10302754,2014-02-11,9422541,Leiser,"Prez and Cherie were absolutely nice hosts. I was really lucky as I was in Seattle by the time of the Superbowl Parade and they took me there. The place itself is quite neat and tidy. Only word of advice for traveler using public transportation  is that the place is a little bit far from bus or train station. Other than that, I strongly recommend this place is you're visiting Seattle for either business or pleasure. Overall had a good experience staying in this place."
571651,10642698,2014-03-01,1053303,Peter,"Prez and Cherie are great and welcoming people, and do their best to make their guests comfortable. I have seen them go out of their way to assist other guests when they needed help, and they are a great source of local information.  It was fun to talk to them when they had time. Prez has a great sense of humour and is a fun guy.  The bed is very comfortable though the wardrobe space is limited, but certainly ok for a few nights or a week."
6424982,33549630,2015-05-29,5772765,Cornelia,"We spent four nights at Ruth's place, and enjoyed it very much. We were Ruth's first Airbnb-guests, and we were impressed of here friendly, welcoming reception. The house is pretty centrally located and was easy to find. It's not too far from the city centre, so we could walk there (about 30 minutes), but we also took either the bus or the car downtown. The room itself was comfortable and had everything we needed. Some useful things like a fridge and a coffee machine were provided in the hallway in front of the room. We especially enjoyed the beautiful japanese garden in front of the house, where we sometimes had dinner or breakfast. Meeting Ruth - and her little dog Diego - was a really pleasant and enjoyable experience. She's a great lady with plenty of interesting stories and information about the city. This encounter and staying at Ruth's place made our visit in Seattle even better and we will keep it - and our accomodation and host - in good memory."
6424982,33870293,2015-06-01,34238665,Jacob,"Our stay with Ruth was wonderful! She lives in a beautiful old neighborhood in Queen Anne overlooking Seattle, and her home was gorgeous. She was very gracious and made us feel welcome to be there. The guest room has it's own bathroom and living room, and is separate from the other half of the house. It's location was minutes from downtown. My wife and I were visiting Seattle for the first time so we were basically only there Friday and Saturday nights, but Ruth gave us a few pointers and had several maps and information pamphlets in our room. We will definitely try to stay with Ruth again next time we visit Seattle, and recommend her unreservedly."
6424982,34568742,2015-06-09,33410430,Laine,"Ruth was wonderful. The location in lower queen anne was prime for my boyfriend and I, as every morning we could walk into town and grab a bite to eat or coffee. The house was very pretty and although the room was slightly dated in style, it was clean. The bathroom was nice although there is no mention of how deep the bathtub is. there is a railing to hold on to but the tub is at least a few feet into the basement, so anyone with injuries or instability might have some trouble. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and talking to Ruth about the city. She was extremely warm and hospitable and we were quite sad when our trip came to a close. "
6424982,35138861,2015-06-15,34239707,Bailin,"My friend and I stayed in Ruth's house for one night, the room is very nice, clean, and comfortable! And it is super cool without air conditioner in summer. Ruth is a super nice, and kind person. She prepared an extra key that you can take with you, so that you can go out to have some fun whenever you want, and she is very thoughtful that she even prepared the first aid kit in the room. If it is possible, I want to stay longer with Ruth. I strongly recommend staying with Ruth, no matter you are travelling in Seattle or have to find a place to live. "
6424982,35582631,2015-06-20,14849182,Katie,"We had a lovely stay in seattle  at Ruths home!very comfortable  and homely.a shame  we didn't get to chat to Ruth more as she made you feel very welcome.would recommend  and stay 100% again.
Thank you Ruth "
6424982,36062616,2015-06-24,7077293,Els,"Ruth was a lovely host with a beautiful home and garden! She made us feel welcome for our brief stay and was a pleasure to chat with. The location is nice and quiet, with a fantastic view of the city. Easy going and organized, with a wealth of lovely stories!"
6424982,36300996,2015-06-27,29966561,Nancy,"Where to start....Ruth's place was perfect, just as it was shown. Located in a beautiful neighborhood, Ruth's place has gorgeous views of the sound's waterfront. She has the property decorated with beautiful flowers, shrubs, and various plants. Even a goldfish pond that is very relaxing to observe.

The bed was very comfy. Beautiful bathroom. We loved the tub/shower, though it is slightly deep (a jacuzzi tub)... sitting area was very nice. It allowed us to sit and chill after a long day in the city. 

Ruth was waiting on us when we arrived. She was very welcoming, as well as, her sweet dog Diego. She gave us a tour of our ""home"". She had snacks and drinks available for us as we arrived.

Ruth was very helpful in what to see and do. She had the bus schedule brochure along with many others to help us guide our way through Seattle. Lots of books on sights and happenings in the city. 

Ruth's place is conveniently located 2 miles from downtown. We were able to walk and enjoy the gorgeous views.

We enjoyed sitting and chatting with Ruth. Only wish we would have had more time to get to know her better. However, we only had 2 1/2 days to see as much as we could. 

We could not have asked for a more perfect place to stay during our visit to Seattle. Thank you Ruth for making our stay a fabulous one!

"
6424982,37352103,2015-07-06,21177193,Ramesh,"We had a very good stay here. Ruth was flexible and wonderful host. The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood, is self sufficient and very accessible to all the main attractions in Seattle. The view from the deck is outstanding. Do not miss it! We would highly recommend it."
6424982,37664150,2015-07-09,33910870,Pat,"My daughter and I were in Seattle for a wedding in the Ballard area. For our last three nights we stayed in the beautiful Queen Anne area of Seattle with its gorgeous views. We were fortunate to meet and chat with our hostess, Ruth. Her home is filled with lovely items and beautiful memories. In the back there is a relaxing and peaceful garden with tables and chairs. The home and basement-level apartment were best accessed from the back alley rather than the many but well-lit front steps going uphill. The apartment consisted of a bedroom, a large family-cum-game room and a bathroom. There was a common area outside these three rooms which had a table for food, coffee, etc. There was also a refrigerator. The bath tub cum shower stall is a  ""step-down"" but there is a hand rail to hold on to. The house next to Ruth's was being re-built. There was some worker activity (probably during the day) but it was not particularly noisy while we were there. Ruth graciously allowed us to use her microwave oven to heat food. Ruth and her little dog Diego spent time with us in the back garden. We had many things in common and enjoyed sharing our stories. Ruth is very warm and family-oriented and has traveled extensively. Ruth had an array of books, etc. about Seattle and was also able to personally recommend places to see, etc. One morning , Ruth drove us ""uphill"" into the commercial area of Queen Anne where we enjoyed a hearty breakfast before making our sight-seeing rounds. Thank you Ruth for your gracious hospitality. You made us feel very welcome.  We wish you the very best in your future endeavors. Pat & Laura P."
6424982,39170892,2015-07-21,34235523,Isaac,"Ruth is a lovely and knowledgeable hostess who made us feel welcome and at home.  She advised on destinations, transportation and dining options.  The house is wonderfully located, close to downtown and 2 bus lines that run frequently during weekdays and offers a welcome retreat from the hustle of the city.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is beautiful with stunning views of Seattle.  Ruth's unit is very clean and stocked with essentials; the pictures for the listing present the accomodations accurately: it is a basement, pleasantly cool in the Summer with ""classic"" decor.  Ruth offers her garden for meals and relaxation.  Like much of Seattle, accessing the unit involves two sets of stairs - a consideration for some.  We enjoyed getting to know Ruth and would eagerly return to her place again."
6424982,39301619,2015-07-22,26325770,Cynthia,"Ruth's home is so very inviting and warm. Even though our stay was quite short, everything we could have needed was there for us. Just a short drive away is Pike Place Market for some delicious chowder and a walk along the waterfront. Back at Ruth's, you can relax on the front porch, which has a fabulous view of Puget Sound, or lounge in the serene and private back yard which is filled with beautiful greenery and a small koi pond. Her home is like a retreat, all in the middle of busy Seattle. A must stay!"
6424982,39434691,2015-07-23,38096326,Michelle,"We checked in and got ready for our concert, but unfortunately we ended up not staying the entire time. Ruth was great and listing is everything that she said. Thanks again Ruth"
6424982,39637334,2015-07-25,24392847,Bruce,"A very warm welcome awaited us, even after our arrival had been delayed by the Seattle traffic! Ruth delayed her evening plans to wait for us. Which we were thankful for. The accommodation was as expected, very satisfactory for our short stay. Great bed! Ruth was so lovely and we had some great conversations about Japan!  Location was great for a city stay - we walked one evening right into the city. And an amazing city view just around the corner from her house. All in all,  happy with our stay. "
6424982,40215112,2015-07-29,34045066,Asa,"Ruth is a sweetheart!  We were out most of the time, but when our paths did cross we shared good conversation.  Her home is in a beautiful section of Queen Anne.  We could see the cruise ships from her front porch.  This is where I did my daily meditation each morning.  She was gracious enough to allow us to leave our car during our 7-day cruise to Alaska.  We appreciated our time with her.  The accommodations were fine.  The bathroom is a little tight, but worked for our needs."
6424982,40544752,2015-07-31,15976530,Michele,Everything about Ruth and her home were great! We loved our short stay there and would highly recommend it. Ruth was really friendly and her home was wonderful. Even though it's a shared room it felt like you had your own apt!  
6424982,40676559,2015-08-01,36426351,Katheryne,"Ruth was a very gracious host and her home was beyond beautiful! We had a good time getting to know her,  and appreciated her recommendations for local food and activities! Her accommodations were fantastic and extremely conveniently located. Located in a gorgeous hillside neighborhood, Ruth's home was a peaceful oasis that we'd be thrilled to visit again!"
6424982,40919554,2015-08-03,534060,Sumi,Neighborhood was very nice and conveniently located. Ruth's home is great and room is as described. Ruth is very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay!
6424982,41093812,2015-08-04,35941331,Mark,"Our one night stay at Ruth's beautiful home in Seattle was comfortable , very well located & super friendly.
We would recommend this property & compliment Ruth on her prompt communication & her local advice.
We were going a cruise ship from pier 66 & this is close by. We were offered a ride to the pier by Ruth which was very generous . Ruth took us by a beautiful viewing point of Seattle. A wonderful experience for 2 Aussies ! "
6424982,41415291,2015-08-07,11264965,Jade,"Ruth greeted us warmly upon arrival and we had a great stay. The room is kind of a small suite, with a private bathroom and sitting area. There's also a private entrance and exit, so I didn't feel like I was bothering anyone if I came back late. Tthe neighborhood is great; you can walk to tons of restaurants, a Trader Joe's and a Top Pot. Highly recommend this listing! "
6424982,41599753,2015-08-08,28575711,Sylviane,"Accueil agréable dans un quartier très chic et proche de Kerry Park. Ruth est charmante et discrète. Chambre confortable, assez petite et un peu sombre. Un bon endroit pour Explorer Seattle."
6424982,42175904,2015-08-11,30902489,Summer,"This place really is a quiet, peaceful sanctuary in Queen Anne. It's walking distance to plenty of restaurants and one of the best views of Seattle. I had access to the entire bottom floor in Ruth's home, including the bedroom, bathroom and a game room. And Ruth was an incredible gracious host who was happy to share information about the area and provide tips. I highly recommend this listing!"
6424982,42415614,2015-08-13,35091106,Amarette,Ruth was absolutely wonderful! Her home is gorgeous and has a fantastic view of the sunset. She made me and my friend feel welcome while also giving us our privacy. I would highly recommend staying here if you have the chance!
6424982,43250941,2015-08-18,37360800,Douglas,"Ruth made us feel very much at home, and was a very gracious host.  We felt very comfortable there."
6424982,43534788,2015-08-20,3629240,Sue & Sallie,Reese was great and communicated well with me throughout our say before and afterwards gave us great recommendations for food and restaurants and locations to go!We appreciated her personal attention. We would not hesitate recommending her place to anyone! 
6424982,44298125,2015-08-25,20184359,Morgan,"Ruth was very welcoming to her beautiful home. It was really great to have our own quiet space to come back to, with easy access to the back door so we did not have to disturb here if we left early or came back late. I can't say we used the bus system often - though the stops are close by - because Uber took way less time (15 minutes vs an hour by bus), but we also found it easy to walk everywhere. We're from NYC though! Definitely recommend staying here if you can!"
6424982,44917901,2015-08-30,3137758,Kelly,We wish we could have stayed longer at Ruth's house.  She is adorable and we would have loved to hear all about her life as her home contains a lot of family history!  The accommodations were  comfortable and cozy! 
6424982,45075818,2015-08-31,35158853,Deb,Quiet basement room - a bit musty. Ruth is very nice and helpful. 
6424982,45574730,2015-09-04,27139581,Grace,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Ruth's accommodation was large and comfortable. On our first evening we were very jet lagged and Ruth gave us a great recommendation for a stroll up to Kerry Park which definitely had the best view of Seattle and the fresh air was wonderful. The location was great, a lovely neighbourhood and Ruth was super friendly and also well travelled herself we didn't see her very much  but when our paths did cross we had a nice chat about Germany and Australia. "
6424982,46597822,2015-09-12,39146855,Robin,What a beautiful house! Talk about a secret garden entrance to a bnb. This was our first airbnb experience  and Ruth really helped make it a wonderful one. 
6424982,47179030,2015-09-16,39620331,Luke,"Ruth was a lovely host, who provided a huge area for her guests in her home. We only stayed a night in Seattle, but the place was well equipped and well suited to our needs. "
6424982,47699831,2015-09-21,4586914,Jane,"Ruth was very nice and I felt welcome in her home. The accommodations were spacious and private. The neighborhood is really lovely - great views, beautiful homes, and close to restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The only downside was that the space was pretty dark, which felt a bit dreary. "
6424982,47822108,2015-09-21,27618176,Christina,"I booked Ruth's home for my mom, who was visiting Seattle for the first time. I love the neighborhood so I wanted her to be close but give her some space too. Ruth's home was a great compromise. Ruth was fairly quick to communicate through messages and when I wanted to reach her sooner, I simply gave her a call. She worked with us to find a time to check in. when we met with her, she explained the way to get in and out of her beautiful home, we met her cute dog Diego, and she talked to us about her family and time in Seattle. The rental is more like i's only basement floor with a bathroom and access to a large living area. There is a fridge which my mom appreciated to store leftovers. it is easier to access the apartment by the back alley which involved climbing and walking down a very steep incline. my Prius bottomed out taking the turn in a couple of times. My mom said she slept very well both nights and it was quiet and comfortable. Ruth even went on a little morning walk with my mom.  Overall it was a great experience for both of us and we would definitely recommend Ruth and her home! "
6424982,48245652,2015-09-24,27546514,Valerie,"Ruth was a wonderful host. The room is quiet and cozy. The internet worked great. The only thing people should be aware of is that there are lots of steps to get to the house and then down the stairs to the room. Also the shower is in a very low jacuzzi type tub. So for people who have hip, knee problems, this would be difficult. Besides the bedroom, private bath, area for making coffee and tea, and a refrigerator in the private quarters, there is a family room with TV. I didn't use that because I was out quite a bit. The view from Ruth's balcony is stunning and her home and neighborhood are fantastic. I would stay again. It is a very special place and Ruth is a sweetheart."
6424982,48420542,2015-09-26,4869864,Roxy,Staying with Ruth was a great experience! The space was great - quite separate with the ability to come and go with ease. The view from the patio was also fantastic! I would definitely stay here again.
6424982,48520940,2015-09-27,8932460,Adam,"Great location in a super beautiful house.  The host was warm and pleasant.  Although it is a shared house, there is a great deal of privacy and even a semi-separate entrance.  "
6424982,48918279,2015-09-29,1002005,Argelia,"My sister and I could not have asked for a better place to explore Seattle. Ruth was warm and welcoming, and her home is spectacular. The bed was comfortable and the location exceptional. It's a short five minute walk downhill to the #1 bus which takes you to Pike Place and beyond. A short walk uphill and you can explore some of Queen Anne's shops and restaurants. I can't forget the short walk to Kerry Park which offers you the BEST view of Seattle. We can't wait to return! Thank you for your hospitality Ruth! "
6424982,49163235,2015-10-01,389332,Dusty,Ruth has a beautiful house and its location is in an amazingly beautiful area. We had a wonderful time staying in her house and the room was so quiet and peaceful. 
6424982,49331065,2015-10-03,1157449,Jeff," Beautiful, quiet, home in a great neighborhood. Not too far from downtown for an Uber car or a 30 minute walk. Super quiet, clean and beautiful home. I would be delighted to stay again, thanks for this peaceful sanctuary in Seattle. "
6424982,49921896,2015-10-07,44357698,Peggy,"My husband and I stayed with Ruth in her beautiful and quaint, 1920s Queen Anne home during the first weekend of October 2015.  Ruth was a very kind and accommodating hostess during our stay.  The house is loaded with the history of her family over the past 45 years, so interesting.  We felt perfectly at home with the basement area that felt like our own little apartment.  Although we got a kick out of the sunken 70's bathtub, Ruth tells us she plans to update the bathroom soon.  The little nook provides a water heating pot, tea/coffee, coffee maker and refrigerator.  The Queen Anne area is filled with beautiful older and stately homes, a beautiful view and is very quiet.  It was easy to catch a bus to the downtown area.  There are unique coffee shops, nice places to eat and a Trader Joe's, just a short walk down the hill.  Although not a problem for us, this home is not for handicapped or disabled persons, as it is a walk up hill and stairs to navigate into the room.  It was easy to communicate with Ruth.  We truly enjoyed our stay and would have never known about or experienced the fabulous Queen Anne area had we not stayed with Ruth.
Thank you Ruth,
Dain and Peggy
Thornton, California"
6424982,52216262,2015-10-27,41329627,Rebecca,"Ruth was a great hostess. As promised, her place was comfortable and very convenient to downtown Seattle. The bed was extremely comfortable which was a concern because of my husband's previous back surgery. We came and went at all times of day and night, had our own key and everything was great. We'll definitely be staying there when we come back to visit our daughter. This was our first Airbnb experience and we'll definitely use it again."
6424982,52991138,2015-11-03,46014256,Mark,Ruth was a great host and her house is beautiful. The Neighborhood is quiet with ample parking and it's an easy bus ride down the hill to all the main attractions. She didn't bother us and let us come and go as we wanted. I would highly recommend staying with Ruth if your travels bring you to Seattle. 
6424982,53486852,2015-11-09,45672014,Gretchen,Ruth was very welcoming and the house was comfortable and in a great location! We had never been to Seattle before and this was an amazing experience. It was a home away from home.
6424982,54118807,2015-11-16,45744366,Thomas,Ruth made me feel very welcome during my three night stay.  Her house is beautiful and in a great neighborhood.  The room/living area had a separate entrance through a very quaint back patio.  Her Queen Anne house is close to downtown and many Seattle landmarks.   
6424982,54300470,2015-11-17,27565292,Annam,"Ruth was gracious and made us feel welcome & at home. Her space is comfortable and clean, and full of great photos and books to look at. We had a great night in Seattle, and loved staying in Queen Anne within walking distance of so many great spots. "
6424982,54909947,2015-11-25,10315445,John,"This was a wonderful inaugural Airbnb, and we are super-happy it was with Ruth at Queen Ann district at Seattle. Getting to know Ruth was the special aspect of our visit. We loved hearing about her family, and the pride she has for them is, well, obvious. Her directions to Queen Ann street from her home were perfect, as was the pizza and salad at Zeeks.  Her house and backyard are beautiful as are the vistas. The room was perfect and super-quiet, and we were, without a doubt, at peace and safe. Can hardly wait to return. BTW--the Seattle Art Museum exhibition of Impressionist artists and Northwest Native American art were truly incredible--MUST see!"
6424982,55301907,2015-11-29,32098187,Austin,"Ruth was an excellent host. Accommodated us even with our changing schedule. She was very friendly and made us feel welcomed. The house was as lovely as the pictures, and everything was clean and tidy."
6424982,56236191,2015-12-11,394173,Gail,"Ruth is a warm and kind-hearted person, and a gracious host. Upon arriving, Ruth helped me find her home when I was a bit lost in the neighborhood. She made sure that I felt comfortable each day in her home, and helped me to find my way in the city.

Ruth’s home was even more beautiful than I could have imagined. It is a very large brick and dark wood home overlooking Puget Sound in the stately Queen Anne district of Seattle. Ruth’s home is cozy, warm and peaceful. The beautiful bedroom where I stayed in Ruth’s basement is quiet, easily accessible from the back of the house, and includes the use of a separate bathroom (including hot tub / steam area). Near the bedroom is a hallway, where there is a refrigerator / freezer, and a place to heat water for drinks. 

The neighborhood around Ruth’s home is very elegant, as is her home. The neighborhood is residential, with many large and beautiful established homes. I went swimming nearby and bought food in the shops along Queen Anne Avenue. There are also parks in the neighborhood, some with a magnificent view of the city.

 I truly loved staying here and most highly recommend this listing to anyone looking for a beautiful and peaceful room in Seattle, one with a very kind host."
6424982,56526855,2015-12-14,34611192,Corrie,"What a terrific home and magnificent views Ruth has! My boyfriend and I found the accommodations perfectly convenient and thoughtful, down to the mint on our pillows, extra shower and bath supplies and super helpful area guides and literature. The shops and restaurants of Queen Anne were a quick walk down the street and Cap Hill and Downtown were just a single bus ride away. We were able to come and go as we pleased which was a concern for us since we’re probably the worst planners and time managers ever. Ruth made our first Airbnb stay exceptional and definitely set the bar for any future reservations. Truly can’t say enough good things about what an awesome hostess she was! Next time we’re in the PNW, we’ll make it a point to stop by her place again."
6424982,57079579,2015-12-21,5820883,Nancy,"I have amazing feedback and have had great experiences with using Airbnb, but fear that Ruth will not be nice or accurate with her review. So, I want to make sure that I am very accurate with details. 

When I booked this I let Ruth know that we were in town just to watch a Gonzaga basketball game. The day prior to our visit she asked ""What time will you arrive tomorrow?"" My reply, ""I believe about 5 PM. We are heading up and over the pass from Coeur d'Alene, so it kind of depends on the weather."" Her response, ""Hi Nancy, I am not sure if I am going to be home when you arrive. Please..."" and she gave specific information of how to enter her house and where the key was.  

We got into town just prior to the game's start due to the weather. While at the game I got her message, ""Nancy, where are you?"" I immediately let her know that we were at the game and would not be there until 10 or 10:30 when the game ended. I knew the check in time was before 9:00 PM, but assumed that had taken place since she gave me specific instructions of how to enter her home. 

We arrived at the house just shortly after 10 PM. Her next message to me let me know that she had waited up until 10 and was ""not able to tell me about the house rules."" She specified check out time and where to place the key. My husband and I left at 9:00 AM without ever seeing her. 

The house was nice and as described. Ruth was good with communication. I was disappointed that she seemed upset with me despite my attempts to accurately communicate with her and in a timely fashion. I wish her no ill. I just have never been expected to meet with any other hosts as ""house rules"" are listed on the sight. We followed those rules as best we could. I am sure she is a lovely lady. I would just have liked her to specify that she wanted to meet us in person to go over ""house rules."" 

We left the place clean and tidy and tried to be quiet and respectful. "
6424982,57689489,2015-12-28,26318589,Zongyue,Thank you Ruth for everything:) the house is really nice! And the location is great as well! We enjoyed the stay! Ruth is very nice and kind. Thank you for letting us check in earlier than usual! And we wish we could stay longer! Very good stay <3
6424982,58231179,2016-01-01,13790356,Candice,"Ruth house at a great location! It's like a high level so you could have a great view from the street where is house is, this make us feel very happy every morning before we start our trip! And it's about 10mins drive to the down where all interesting place are. The room you will stay is in the basement, it's a little cold there. But the room is really cozy~and also you will have your own bathroom. It's a pity that we could not cook there, and all the time if at home you could only stay in the base room, so if you come with family you might better choose another cook place "
6424982,58369519,2016-01-02,12051477,Autumn,Ruth was a great host! We really enjoyed her beautiful home and private room. Thanks for being such a friendly host. Great place to stay for New Year's Eve! 
5143441,26448760,2015-02-13,5701375,Judy,"We so enjoyed our stay in this accommodation.  Susan was great, and we loved the house; the kitchen was so nice we entertained there instead of at our son's apartment.  Close to two bus lines.  And a neighborhood cat wandered in twice for a visit.  The bed was good for us.  Definitely will make this our home away from home in Seattle in the future."
5143441,26713614,2015-02-17,15323103,Kristine,Susan was very helpful since we weren't sure when we would arrive. She had yummy pastries waiting for us.  The listing is accurate.  The house is beautiful and we really enjoyed cooking in the bright and airy kitchen.
5143441,27039413,2015-02-23,11239118,Ashley,"Susan was very accommodating and the apartment was fantastic! We were able to check in a little early with no issues at all. Susan had some snacks and coffee available for us in the kitchen and left a nice welcome note in the bedroom. The apartment itself was beautiful, extremely clean and spacious. The location was great for us as we wanted to explore Ballard and Green Lake. Perfect stay! "
5143441,27379525,2015-03-02,16191580,John,"Lovely treetop view of Ballard and --in gorgeous sunshine-- the Olympic mountains! Cute and eclectic decor, a bright and welcoming home to stay in. Susan met us and explained the few things we needed to know. She left us delicious pound cake for our breakfast and vanished away. :)  Comfortable neighborhood close to Ballard, Fremont, and Queen Anne. Easy to find and minutes from where we needed to be."
5143441,28031222,2015-03-16,14443625,Adel,"What a lovely place! It is beautifully and creatively decorated, comfortable, and well-situated. Susan was a generous host to us, providing an extra air mattress and ensuring we were all comfortable. When we locked ourselves out of the house, she was there immediately to let us back in!  Her two sweet cats guarded the house well. 

Highly recommended, we'll definitely be back again!"
5143441,28413526,2015-03-23,7059387,Kristin,"We loved staying here!  The home was beautiful!  I was recovering from jetlag and was so happy to find a deliciously comfortable bed to rest my weary body.  The place is full of natural light, which I loved.   Street parking was available right in front of the home and everything we were doing was just minutes away in Fremont.  I would definitely stay here again.  It really felt like home!"
5143441,28618314,2015-03-27,22921252,Amy,"Susan's beautiful late 1920s character home is in perfect condition with a gorgeous skylit kitchen and a lovely bath. Susan takes great care of her guests providing coffee, tea, a great bed, books,  games galore and more. Her home is on a great block, walking distance to Ballard and Freemont. I had such a restful, relaxing stay that i plan to return. "
5143441,28894586,2015-03-31,13373746,Karl,"Susan's Seattle Charm was a delight to stay in. Its very spacious with perfect amenities for a vacation in Seattle. The location is unbeatable, with bus stops near by as well as grocery stores. Ballard is a fun neighborhood with an awesome restaurant and night life scene to explore.
Susan was beyond accommodating and she was a great host to work with. If we come back to Seattle, we'll definitely stay at her place if it's available!!"
5143441,29494355,2015-04-08,27505847,Susan,"Susan was a great host with a lovely home.  The space was exactly as described and truly charming!  We were delighted to receive a home baked treat several times and we were made to feel at home.  Great quiet neighborhood; walking distance from Fremont and Ballard.  Easy street parking, plenty of books, games, kitchen supplies, bedding, and towels, plus a comfy bed.  We hope to come stay again next year!"
5143441,29695809,2015-04-11,2472072,Catherine,"Susan met us and made us feel welcome at once.  We had to move out of our condo which is only about 2 miles away as we were having the upstairs bedrooms recarpeted.  Susan's beautiful rental was a 'home away from home' for us.  She has thought of everything.  The bed was extremely cozy and comfortable, nice shower with lots of lotions and toiletries for our use.  The kitchen is large and very well equipped with a nice patio to sit outside. Lovely wood floors and lots of natural light.  It is exactly as the photos show, but even bigger than we expected. The location is fabulous.  Loads of excellent restaurants in nearby Ballard.  If you don't want to drive you can ride the bus or take Uber. You can also take the bus downtown Seattle, it takes about 25 to 30 minutes depending on time of day. 
We would highly recommend renting from Susan.  You won't regret it.  We are experienced AirBnb renters nationally and internationally(15 with this one). We would consider this to be in our top rentals."
5143441,30299491,2015-04-20,15323103,Kristine,Susan is very good about communicating with me prior to my arrival.  We text each other and she responds very quickly.
5143441,31324457,2015-05-04,26274892,Beth,"Our first airbnb experience was better than expected. The location was perfect. Everything was as advertised and a bit more. Homemade muffins, coffee and goodies in the frig for breakfast. The view on the little deck in the evenings and early morning was a treat. The bed was wonderful. Although we never saw Susan as we slipped in and out for the weekend, she was gracious and quickly answered our questions via text and the airbnb app. We'll definitely stay in the future when visiting our daughters in Seattle. 

Thanks Susan,
Beth & Jeff"
5143441,31672471,2015-05-08,16814782,Stewart,"Susan was great and her home is beautiful. When I arrived, she showed me around the apartment and provided many great suggestions for places to eat in Ballard. She'd provided coffee, tea, milk, snacks, and tea cakes, which I enjoyed in her huge kitchen and out on the patio. Susan is welcoming, the place is perfect, and you'll not be disappointed."
5143441,32127217,2015-05-14,24194293,Bobby,"Susan was such a great host! Made us feel at home. We couldn't be more thankful. Especially being there for our wedding & never visiting the area before. Her house was absolutely beautiful. We had a great experience staying in Ballard. Her home is located at a convenient location to everything. From finding amazing places to eat, parks, grocery stores. Downtown Seattle is only a 5 minute drive. "
5143441,32566682,2015-05-19,11822550,David,"The listing is accurate, yet the description doesn't capture the full charm of the wonderful heritage home tucked away on a quiet street in one of Seattle's eclectic neighbourhoods. The unit was very clean, with a large living room for reading or watching the modern television setup, and a kitchen well-lit with natural light tucked away for dinner and coffee. Coffee, tea and pound cake were provided, which I thought was a nice touch. I loved the wooden ceiling in the living room and the wooden window trim.  

Susan was very prompt and professional in her correspondence with us, and we were able to book with ease. Very happy to have stayed with Susan and look forward to doing so again. "
5143441,32846638,2015-05-22,24024710,Judith,"We spent a lovely night in Susan's place.  It's charming, cozy, eclectic and felt like home within about five minutes.  She left us yummy baked treats, which we enjoyed in the morning with coffee on the deck looking out to the mountains.  There were so many lovely touches--interesting books, slippers, killer coffee, flowers--and Susan herself could not have been more helpful or welcoming.   We could have stayed and stayed!"
5143441,33041886,2015-05-24,150579,Jacquelyn,"Susan's apartment is a true gem! I feel so lucky to have found it. The apartment is very spacious and decorated in a relaxing, homey style. The neighborhood is very quiet and in a central location. I highly recommend it!"
5143441,33310515,2015-05-26,2079501,Keith,"Susan's place was a lot more ""charming"" than we expected. Really nice spot. The place was clean. The neighborhood seemed pretty laid-back. The only things that may be negatives for some is that you can hear through the walls a bit, and that it's a fairly long walk (~20 mins) to the main streets of Ballard. But we really enjoyed it. Thanks, Susan!"
5143441,33792473,2015-06-01,110485,Heather,"From the moment we entered the suite, we were awestruck by the beauty and home-like ambience of Susan's accommodations.  Susan's thoughtfulness in stocking the kitchen with all the necessities left nothing to be desired.  The neighborhood was very quiet and we had a most restful sleep.  We would definitely stay in this suite again on our next return to Ballard.  Thanks again Susan for providing us a home away from home!"
5143441,34399722,2015-06-08,12902408,Jeanette,Susan was easily to contact. Everything we needed was available to us. The neighborhood was quiet and close to many stores. 
5143441,34732235,2015-06-11,5573544,Andrew,"I couldn't have asked for a better Seattle apartment for our stay. Susan immediately made us feel welcome and greeted us at the door. The sun filled apartment contained all of the amenities we could have wanted, and Susan provided baked treats for breakfast. She also stopped by on a particularly hot day to offer sunscreen. The apartment was comfortable and clean,  well decorated and conveniently located. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone and will consider staying here again on my next trip to Seattle. "
5143441,35293784,2015-06-17,26951634,Angela B,"Seattle Charm is certainly charming. The apartment is even larger (and sunnier!) than it appears in photos, which was a pleasant surprise. We never met Susan during our 5 day stay; though we were aware that she was around the property occasionally. 

Susan was a gracious host... the apartment was clean, (it was like staying with a friend or relative - don't look TOO hard for dust/cobwebs); and she left some small baked goods for us, as well as coffee; which was greatly appreciated. We did use the kitchen several times, and found everything we needed to prepare our meals. The local Trader Joe's is 4 mins away by car. 

Be aware that there are tenants living on the ground floor of the house, as well as someone (it changed) staying in the apartment above. The walls/floor/ceilings are rather thin, and you can hear quite a lot of the goings on (music, conversations, footsteps, etc).  

We absolutely loved the area (nestled between Fremont/Wallingford/Ballard/Phinney Ridge), but feel it is definitely suited to having a car (we had a rental while there). Parking was sometimes tight on the street, but always available. As for the neighborhood itself, there isn't much in the way of food or entertainment. It is very residential, as expected. We spent a lot of time in nearby Ballard (5-10 mins by car), which we adored.

The WiFi was problematic for us... (my brand new iPhone 6+ would constantly get kicked off). It wasn't worth the frustration to reconnect every 3 minutes. If WiFi is extremely important to you, that would be a consideration.  Though we didn't ever use it, we appreciated the availability of the Roku/TV. 

The cats were shy, and didn't bother us in the least. (I'm allergic, so I wasn't looking for them to be underfoot while outside). 

The small back deck is completely lovely. We spent a lot of time out there in the evenings, having a glass of wine, and watching the sun set behind the rooftops. 

All in all, we definitely recommend staying at Seattle Charm if you're looking to experience the non-touristy side of Seattle.  Thanks Susan!
"
5143441,35559924,2015-06-20,6677262,Karl," absolutely enjoyed our stay, comfortable and tastefully appointed accommodation, close to Ballard restaurants and night life. Susan is a delightful host. Absolutely a showcase airbnb experience. Highly recommend & intend to book next time in Seattle. "
5143441,36506747,2015-06-29,10955693,Val,"Susan provides a delightful stay in Seattle. She's a helpful, informative and friendly host, and her apartment has so much character and charm. It has a great kitchen and comfortable living areas. Ballard is a cool neighbourhood -- Susan's suggestion of local eateries (we'd recommend Bourbon & Bones) were all within walking distance. The Fred Meyer grocery store was a short drive (though you could still walk) but has everything you need, plus more. It was easy to catch the bus into the central city, and the apartment's location meant you were away from the inner city traffic mayhem. We'd highly recommend the apartment. Thanks Susan for a wonderful stay."
5143441,37110949,2015-07-04,29523136,Kelly,"Susan made us feel very welcome.  It was easy to get into the apartment and it was furnished with everything we needed, and more.  She was very quick to bring us an extra fan to help with the unusually hot weather we experienced.  The 3rd bed was a small chaise lounge that folded down flat and she brought us an extra foam padding for it.  It was the perfect size for our 11-year old - - who declared it the most comfortable bed ""ever.""  The view from her place was great and felt like we were at home.

Thank you, Susan!"
5143441,37293719,2015-07-06,6077807,Britt,Our visit to Seattle was wonderful and care free. Susan made the stay easy and hassle free. Her place is described perfectly on the site and was great for the 4 of us. The location was nice and all of our needs were met. Susan was a great host and we'd happily stay there again. 
5143441,37606100,2015-07-08,36539765,Terry,"We were visiting from Vancouver for a concert in downtown Ballard. After being stuck in a 3 hour border wait in the hot sun, we were tired, hot and hungry. Walking into Susan's lovely apartment we found a beautiful breeze wafting through the open windows, a fan in both the bedroom and living room and some snacks in the fridge, including a little banana loaf. All were very appreciated. 

The apartment is gorgeous and clean. We were traveling with my Mother-in-Law so she sleep soundly in the queen sized bed in the bedroom and my Husband and I slept on the futon in the living room. Susan left us clean sheets, and there were extra blankets in the bedroom. 

We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment during our stay, and we didn't meet Susan, but all our needs were met. We wanted to be able to walk to and from downtown Ballard which were able to do easily in about 20 min. 

As mentioned in another review, the walls are thin as is typical in a character home. If you are sensitive to noise you may want to stay in a newer home. We are musicians so for us the character and proximity were worth a bit of noise. 

Despite not meeting Susan, we found her gracious and accommodating. We enjoyed our stay. "
5143441,38329791,2015-07-14,19242872,Jim,"Susan was great and accommodating, we loved our stay!"
5143441,38847317,2015-07-19,33855918,Anna,"Susan was a very gracious host and made us feel welcome and at home. The pound cake, yogurts, and presence of other kitchen staples (nice tea collection, coffee) were appreciated. The house is lovely, tasteful and comfortable. It was quiet and we were undisturbed. We walked to Ballard and had a delicious dinner one night, but otherwise were glad we had a car to get around the city. I would recommend this home to anyone who wanted a serene and beautiful place to stay in Seattle."
5143441,39065120,2015-07-20,37166228,Forrest,"Great stay. Clean, private and well appointed place to rest and visit a couple craft beer locations in Seattle. I would recommend Susan's place in Ballard to anyone! Thanks Susan."
5143441,39288298,2015-07-22,34232595,Camala,"We so enjoyed our stay at Susan's place -- it is absolutely charming.  I am aesthetically-oriented, so really loved how the house is decorated and all the artistic touches.  We were visiting for a wedding and had come off a 3 day whirlwind of social activities, and Susan's place was a calm, peaceful and welcoming environment.  Susan was a great host -- very accessible, responsive and thoughtful.  The place was spotless, the location quiet but convenient to the Ballard business district, and the overall experience just delightful.  We will definitely try to stay again on our next visit to Seattle."
5143441,39622191,2015-07-25,22572580,Muzi,"First sorry for the delay, we just finished our trip and came back home. Susan's house was so pretty and clean. The community was quite and safe, also it's easy to find food nearby. Susan is very nice and communicative, she left everything clear. We definitely had a great time there."
5143441,40095154,2015-07-28,17173383,Mai,Susan is such a hospitable and accommodating hostess. We wanted to check in earlier than 3 to get ready for the wedding that evening and she was more than happy to welcome us to her place as early as 1 pm. As we arrived and checked in to her lovely house she even informed us ahead of time about the possible road closure and traffic jam that weekend due to an event downtown. Her house is beautifully kept and everything we needed for the stay was provided. My family had such a lovely stay and rest in Seattle at Susan's. Definitely will recommend Susan's place to our friends and family and looking forward to another visit. Thank you. 
5143441,41632818,2015-08-08,15780125,Lauren,"A group of 4 of us (2 couples) stayed at Susan's home in Seattle. It was in a beautiful location and the home was very well maintained even though it was an older home. In fact, we wouldn't have wanted it any other way. The home was stunning, and it was obvious that Susan took great care of the place and wanted every guest to feel at home, which we did. 

Everything we needed to know was provided to us either in the airbnb page or her personal binder present in the home. We had a great experience and highly recommend this getaway to anyone interested. 

Thanks, Susan! 

Lauren & Tim"
5143441,42522421,2015-08-14,7387292,Paula,"We found Susan's place to be exactly as described in her listing. It was comfortable, spacious and well appointed.  The neighborhood feels rural for being in a city and we were always able to park our rental car right in front. The heart of the Ballard neighborhood is a short drive (or 20 minute walk) away, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants to explore. We were able to get to just about everywhere we wanted to visit with a 15 minute drive. Susan was a great host and responded immediately to any questions we had. She also provided us with fresh baked goods almost every day of our stay. This is a great place for a relaxed stay in Seattle."
5143441,43627329,2015-08-21,35796528,Joyce,"Seattle Charm is an apt description for this lovely place. As others have said, it's even better than the pictures, which can't fully capture the views of mountains, big trees, and fun little backyard garden. We stayed for 6 nights during our first trip ever to Seattle. It was a great place for an extended stay--nicely decorated, very clean, and well outfitted with everything we needed. A friend joined us for part of our stay, making us 3 guests, and the place was spacious enough to accommodate all of us. The kitchen/eating area is especially nice with lots of windows and light--a great place for breakfast before our days in the city. The apartment is in a nice, quiet neighborhood and is pretty conveniently located. We were carless and managed fine taking buses. I highly recommend Susan's place and would definitely stay there again if we return to this beautiful part of the country!"
5143441,44105099,2015-08-24,31288926,Dee,"Susan's apartment provided a lovely stay for my family of four on our trip to Seattle. The space was clean, warm and inviting, very generous in size, and beautifully decorated. Susan provided lots of options for breakfast, which was so nice after spending so much time in restaurants over the previous several days. The location was very convenient to downtown Seattle, but there were also great options in the neighborhood of Ballard. I would definitely recommend Susan's place and would stay there again in a heartbeat."
5143441,45472332,2015-09-03,21166809,Sara,"Susan was a great host for myself and my dad on our very first trip to Seattle. Her place is very similar to the way it is described on her page, and suited us well for our needs. It was clear that a cat lived there, so if smell or dander bother you, I would recommend taking that into consideration. We didn't overlap with Susan very much, but she would text me to check in and see if we needed anything. The area was very quiet, which was nice, but we found that we definitely appreciated having rented a car for our trip. There was plenty of on street parking right in front of the house. Overall, we had a great trip and would definitely consider staying with Susan again!"
5143441,46266903,2015-09-09,33467543,Hope,"This is the first time that I have stayed at an air bnb, and it definitely will not be the last. Susan is a very attentive and welcoming host and we had a most excellent stay.  She brought us milk and creamer for our morning coffee when we arrived & we did not have to go to the store. Her home is very cozy and charming indeed, we felt at home right away.  There are books everywhere, antique postcards, animal-shaped candle holders, and lovely throw pillows. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and close to the best of Ballard.  It was very nice to have a kitchen to enjoy breakfast in pj's and make late-night popcorn.  A true gem, mostly because of Susan, would stay there again.  "
5143441,46491724,2015-09-11,38849317,Andrew,"We had a completely charmed experience that was unfortunately only one night as we journeyed on from Ballard to the San Juans. Susan's place reflected her own fine taste, with everything from furnishings to pillows to books (copious numbers of them, strategically placed so you're never not running into a book!) carefully chosen and rendered. Though only one-bedroom, it has a sense of spaciousness in room size and layout that made it appear anything but cramped. Lovely little deck out back, window seats, quiet street, close to Ballard's many downtown delights. Major LIKE from here!"
5143441,48893728,2015-09-29,9449310,Ellen,"We really felt at home at Susan's.  The place is lovely and immaculately clean.  Susan thoughtfully provided all the goodies for a nice breakfast the first morning.  The book selection was amazing and we really enjoyed hanging out and relaxing 'at home'.  The location worked perfectly for us: quiet neighborhood, near public transport & walking distance to Ballard. Also convenient if you have a car as there appeared to be ample parking on the street. Would definitely like to come back."
5143441,50131100,2015-10-09,45528487,Lindsey,"Susan was quick to engage me through a text or phone call, provided accurate details about how to access the house and where keys were left. The home was incredibly beautiful and I've already suggested her Ballard location to my family members. Other have mentioned the faint smell of cats; while some may have felt it important to note this as a nuisance its more important to note that for two extremely allergic guest this cat thing was not a problem. There are outdoor cats at the property, but with 100% certainty I can say that this charmer is fur free and exquisitely clean.  I would definitely stay again. "
5143441,51455411,2015-10-20,25440937,Sean,"What a great place! Perfectly situated to get to all that Seattle has to offer, Susan's wonderful cottage has everything you need. And what a great host. Super friendly, super helpful, we'll definitely be back. Thanks Susan!"
5143441,53479010,2015-11-09,45119671,Damian,"What a beautiful home! It's rare to find a house like this with so much history, and yet so well maintained. There was an amazing attention to detail, and yet the home felt very comfortable and cozy. 

Susan was a great host, and was quick to respond when we needed anything. We really enjoyed Ballard as well, with all of it's great shops and restaurants. 

Overall, a wonderful experience. "
5143441,54111982,2015-11-16,11245115,Tara & Jeremiah,"We were in town to see some friends, but I was just as happy to spend all weekend reading in this wonderful home. 

This beautiful apartment occupies the bottom floor of Susan's house. (Your entrance is separate.) It's welcoming, spacious, and lovingly decorated, with high ceilings, comfortable furniture, an eclectic selection of books to borrow, and nice wide window seats. We got a great night's sleep in the supportive bed. I especially loved the bright and generously proportioned kitchen, with its basket of interesting teas.

It's an older house, so expect creaky floors when your hosts are walking about upstairs. (They're not at all loud; it's just the nature of the house.) If you don't mind that, Susan's apartment is the absolute perfect place to stay in Ballard. We certainly hope to be back!"
5143441,54554408,2015-11-21,6168546,David,"Susan had great communication and was flexible with check-in and check-out. The house was lovely, clean, and perfectly Seattle (as advertised)"
5143441,54974740,2015-11-27,16852031,Matthew,"This place is fantastic and my in laws really enjoyed it here. Really no complaints at all. We actually stayed at another Airbnb rental down the block but I preferred this place. Ballard is great area with some really good restaurants nearby like brimmer & healtap for a higher end dining experience and veraci for some excellent pizza. One of the best coffee houses, Slate is nearby as well and worth a visit. Safeway nearby, about a 10 minute walk. Also some nice craft beer joints with food trucks. We went to Stoup and Reuben's. I will definitely come here again as it would be fine for family of 4."
5143441,55897995,2015-12-07,8739036,Carl,"Seattle Charm is a lovely quiet home in an equally quiet neighborhood.   Susan's welcoming baked goods are nice after a long day of travel.  A variety of reading material, board games, and an extra down comforter round things out if you have any time for lounging at her place. "
5143441,56799701,2015-12-18,611445,Daniel,"Susan's apartment is as beautiful as it looks in the photos; it was a very comfortable place to stay. One of the best airbnb experiences we have had. Minor (but important) things: the heat worked really well, and it's very easy to park on the street. Highly recommended! "
8033438,47121821,2015-09-15,43383721,Jacob,"I just only stayed there for a night, the rest of the rent were my mom and my brother. But i think Farah and her boyfriend are very kind, they always try to help us with anything. My mom and my brother are very happy when they lived there. If i can go back to Seattle, i will stay in there house for sure :). Absolutely im gonna suggest them for my friends. "
8033438,47236497,2015-09-16,10082804,Jason,"This was a nice stay, good location in Ballard. The keybox was handy for when I needed to arrive while Farah was out."
8033438,47440090,2015-09-18,21428157,Vicky,"Farah was able to accommodate my boyfriend and me with only two days advance notice. She is very responsive and flexible. Her place is very close to bus stop, bakery, and restaurants. Everyone at her place was very friendly. Thanks Farah :)"
8033438,50823055,2015-10-14,46245965,Tanveer,All good. 
8033438,51375828,2015-10-19,3562983,Mark,My stay in Ballard was quite pleasant. The room is as pictured and described. The neighborhood is quiet and the house is a short walk to a bus that will take you directly downtown. Farah was a great host and helped me figure out the best ways to travel around.  I would stay here again. 
8033438,51519699,2015-10-20,28350320,Deandra,"Though I did not get to meet Farah, her place was great and in a good spot just a short walk from lots on interesting things. It was a quiet space with clean shower, farah was quick to get back to me when I had questions, and totally awesome for letting me crash on short notice! Definitely recommend! "
8033438,51776163,2015-10-24,42486310,Amanda,It was wonderful and Farah was very kind with me as I arrived late. 
8033438,51986999,2015-10-25,46520053,Kwany,"The bedroom is just as the picture shown. Comfy and clean. Farah and her boyfriend are nice. They handed us a guidebook when we arrived and told us where to go. We had a pleasant stay at the house. Ohh and Farah, I will definitely tell you if I can squeeze into the crowd in Time Square on new years eve lol"
8033438,52471221,2015-10-29,45935480,Laura,Farah and Ben were warm and hospitable.  Both were helpful with suggestions.  The place is nice and convenient as it's a few minutes away from downtown and transit.  I'd recommend it!!
8033438,52805045,2015-11-01,25061746,Jeremy,Farah was very friendly and accommodating.  The bed was comfy and I had a beautiful sleep.  The bus to downtown was only a couple minute walk away!  Great stay.
8033438,53088430,2015-11-04,46943510,Jasmine,"Nice, cute house in a great location. Room was nicely kept with a full length mirror and right by the bathroom. Farah was very nice and helpful. "
8033438,53283120,2015-11-07,38782917,Nery,I had a very pleasant experience to say the least! Parking is no issue and the neighborhood is safe and very walkable. You are walking distance from restaurants and museums. I would highly recommend staying with Farah.
8033438,53853191,2015-11-13,48294419,Marnie,Farah was so welcoming and accommodating on short notice!! The room was accurately portrayed in the listing pictures. 
8033438,54058523,2015-11-15,27282225,Kellie,"Farah is the biggest sweetheart! She was more than accommodating in her home. The room was perfect and a beautiful 10 minute walk down to coffee shops, bakeries, and stores. "
8033438,54360320,2015-11-18,41648635,Roman,"Nous avons du attendre un bon moment à sa porte; le mail avec les instructions a été posté dans la matinée du jour de notre arrivée ; nous avons contacté farah avec un phone français; à son arrivée elle rigolait de la situation et ensuite il a fallu tout demander ( le wifi ,le linge de toilette); lit correct mais il faut soulever la porte  pour  fermer la porte un gond cassé; "
8033438,54402939,2015-11-19,36246661,Joshua,Had a very enjoyable stay at Farah's house.  She responded promptly to questions that I had and was very accommodating with an unexpected change in my travel plans.  The room was very cozy and just as described.  
8033438,56412707,2015-12-13,49710243,David,"My room was exactly as pictured. The house was quiet, neat and clean at all times. Farah responded to all inquiries no matter how trivial both quickly and thoughtfully. The house rules were simple clear and sensible. Meeting Farah was an absolute delight. I will definitely stay here the next time I am in the area. "
8033438,56813584,2015-12-18,36777132,Kohei,They are perfect
6740521,36447019,2015-06-28,35669196,Stephen,"The listing description was completely accurate.  The apartment was beautiful, clean and new, and the view over Seattle was spectacular.  It's located right near downtown (if not right inside of it) and so the neighboring area is quite nice.  It's also a short walk from the convention center (about 10 min if you're quick).  Parking is not typically available at the apartment, but there are a couple of parking lots right nearby that offer day parking for $15.  The host was also friendly and helpful.  He responded within a few minutes if I had questions about anything and went out of his way to help us out.  Overall, it was a great place to stay!"
6740521,37530857,2015-07-07,20292443,Renee,"I booked this place for my friends visiting from China during the Independence Day Holiday. The place was very clean, modern with lots of sun light in a smart-looking high-rise located in downtown Seattle from where my friends walked to the Space Needle and the downtown shopping area. Sunil and his wife were very accommodating and responsive. My friends were very happy with their stay. Thank you so much!"
6740521,38542501,2015-07-16,37447873,David,Great place for a family. Very quiet and much more comfortable than a hotel. 
6740521,38946659,2015-07-19,37101915,Amir,"Stayed at Sunil's apartment for 3 night. Very clean and nice place. Right in downtown, everything is within ealking distance. They are very welcoming and hospitable. Quick on responding to inquiries. Overall it was a good experience."
6740521,39337743,2015-07-22,1809814,Ted,"Sunil was a great host - very communicative, easy to get in and out, very helpful whenever needed. And the place was beautiful and in a great location as well. I never got the chance to meet sunil in person, but hope to stay at his place again sometime."
6740521,39578131,2015-07-24,38119429,Leslie,Sunil was very helpful.  The apartment was as described.  The location was ideal for walking to all main attractions in the Seattle downtown.  We really appreciated the restaurant suggestions. It was a pleasure to meet Anna. Good luck with the new baby.
6740521,39795328,2015-07-26,36050167,Olivier,"L'appartement de Sunil était exactement ce que nous cherchions : grand et confortable, bien situé (beaucoup de choses sont faisables à pieds) et pour un prix raisonnable. De plus Sunil a su être disponible pour nous aider à trouver nos marques, il nous a conseillé de bons restaurants dans les environs. Au cours du séjour il a aussi vérifié que tout allait bien pour nous. Le plus hyper agréable : voir les hydravions décoller de Lake Union le matin en se reveillant ! 
Au final, n'hésitez pas, cet appartement, sa localisation en ville, sa vue et les conseils de son propriétaire en font à ce prix une très bonne affaire !"
6740521,40969826,2015-08-03,11841852,Daniel,"Sunil's place was as advertised. Very nice, clean, and comfortable place, conveniently located near many Seattle sights. There was plenty of space for all four of us and Sunil was extremely welcoming and responsive. "
6740521,43471061,2015-08-19,40998136,Nadia,The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6740521,43551332,2015-08-20,40624407,Mike,"The apartment was exactly as described.  Very clean, very comfortable, great view; stocked with soap/shampoo/conditioner.  Sunil and Anna were very welcoming and, as someone who had never been to Seattle before this trip, very helpful.

Would definitely stay here again."
6740521,45267667,2015-09-01,38117040,Eric,"I never actually met Sunil or his wife in person, but they were very responsive, quick, and very friendly when communicating with me.  The place itself is gorgeous, right near downtown, with very comfortable beds.  It was far more spacious than I had thought it'd be.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want to stay in downtown Seattle."
8372038,49965824,2015-10-07,8994422,Josh,"Big fan of Dan's downtown Seattle apartment. Visited for a Seahawks game, stadium and plenty of other downtown activities were walking distance - Dan was really helpful with local restaurant recommendations too. 

As advertised - all the crucial amenities, all the more reason to get out and explore the city :) "
8372038,50059047,2015-10-08,43134218,Courtney,Dan was a fabulous host! He met me right on time with the keys and in really short notice too as this was a last minute trip. The apartment is much bigger than I expected. The pictures really don't do it justice. There are high ceilings and the living room is gigantic. Really nice that there wasn't a lot of personal belongings so plenty of closet space and it really felt like my own apartment not like I was staying as a guest. Location is perfect too right in the middle of downtown. Real close to Cap Hill and Pioneer Square too and within 10 minutes of all the Seattle neighborhoods. It's right next to a hotel so there is literally taxis lined up outside at all times so don't even need to use Uber. I would definitely recommend this apartment. 
8372038,50406930,2015-10-11,31610425,Shyla,"Dan is a wonderful host! He was super helpful, responsive, and over all a great guy! His place was exactly as he described it, and it was clean, and perfect for my trip. He was so kind when he offered to add another bed for my guest! He was in close contact with me before the trip, during the trip, and after the trip was completed. I will definitely be booking with him again when I come back to the area!"
8372038,50609729,2015-10-12,46332159,Michaela,Dan was very welcoming and was really good at communicating and giving me all the information I needed for the apartment. Told me the best places to park and how to get into the building. Even let me know best nearby restaurants with his welcome guide on the counter right when you walk in along with some current newspapers. The apartment was really big and had lots of space. You could fit an elephant in there! Bed was comfortable and there were plenty of towels. I think the best part about the place is the location! Really is central to everything. 
8372038,51004042,2015-10-16,29011080,Ben,"I had a great experience in Seattle and Dan's apartment was awesome. It was very close to the light rail (5-10min walk) and once I got there it was easy to figure out how to get into the apartment. The apartment was clean....and VERY big....you could easily have 4 people stay there. The bed was comfortable, and there was a fan to drown out some of the city noise (nice touch). The location is great. 10 minute walk to pikes place market and 10 minute walk to chinatown. 

Dan was VERY quick to respond to all my questions and super helpful. I inquired about the apartment...and within a few hours I was there. I would definitely rent this place again if I find myself in the Seattle area. "
8372038,51102870,2015-10-17,42786555,Annika,"Dan kept in touch via text and answered all of questions straight away! We were looking for a night out and following Dan's suggestions, we had a great one! Nice part of the city!"
8372038,51392685,2015-10-19,26382355,Ian,"The flat was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Dan was quick to follow up on the reservation and gave us some background on the area, which helped us enjoy a post Seahawks game meal.  Dan is a gracious host.  "
8372038,51601316,2015-10-21,13131339,Kena,Loft like and very spacious. Centrally located to everything in downtown. His response time was immediate. Definitely would stay here again.
8372038,51978998,2015-10-25,40236384,Oates,Great guest!
8372038,52148706,2015-10-26,1328530,Lauren,Dan was an awesome host! Responsive and helpful. The apartment is in a great location.  The decor is cute and the apartment is spacious. 5 stars I would stay here again! 
8372038,52357326,2015-10-28,22098386,Rachael,"Dan was a fantastic host, and was very welcoming. He made sure that we had everything that we needed and was incredibly friendly and easy going. The apartment was fantastic, amazing location, and very comfortable, exactly how described. We had a great time staying there!"
8372038,52887035,2015-11-02,46382921,Ashley,"For my first trip to Seattle Dan was an awesome host and he was kind enough to check in via text (and call...I didn't have the volume up). This place was easy to find (especially from the Pioneer Square Station) with a security door (major plus if you're not used to being on your own). This apartment was great for what we needed. Everything was clean and all the essentials were there. The location was perfect; only a few blocks from the market and from anything you would ever need. I would recommend using Uber to get to anywhere that is going to be more than a 30 minute walk (for first time visitors: the hills in Seattle are real). I initially had considered a hotel but this place suited my needs much better since it had a kitchen and living room. I will be staying here again because the price, location and Dan were that great. "
8372038,53272237,2015-11-07,44874251,Abhishek,"An excellent, spacious and well organized place with great privacy and location. Dan is very supportive and helped and responded whenever required :-)"
8372038,54017919,2015-11-15,6165113,Efren,"Dan's apartment is indeed great, located in a vintage building, is perfectly located, walking distance to downtown, Pioneer Square or even Capitol Hill. It has two big bedrooms, big living room and kitchen, and with all the utilities needed for daily basis. I would definitely come back to his apartment if visit again Seattle. Dan has nice tips for you and is always taking care in case you need something for the house or the city itself. Thanks :)"
8372038,54280700,2015-11-17,48343362,Andrew,Nice clean and well appointed suite in downtown Seattle.  Would definitely recommend Dan's place to anyone looking for a big and inexpensive Seattle get away!
8372038,54603925,2015-11-22,46816372,Joshua,"Dan was a great host. His directions upon arrival were detailed and precise. He was also quick to respond to any questions or concerns that we had. Overall the place was just what we were looking for. A great location in between pikes and capitol hill making it easy to get to both places by walking. Even on the days we took an uber back the ride was always less than 5 bucks. The only down side to the place was the absence of wifi and cable, but if your travelling around the city, there are plenty of places to connect. We would  definately stay here again on any future visits to the city."
8372038,55113135,2015-11-28,43198964,Yoonjae,"He is the best host i ever met. Really kind, fast reply for our question. The house is comfortable and good for going everywhere by walking in seattle downtown. I spent great time in his house during my vacation. "
8372038,55275025,2015-11-29,6487498,Kati,Dan's apartment worked out great! Perfect location and he was very communicative in making sure we had everything we needed. 
8372038,55537989,2015-12-01,49791858,Bryan,"I spent 2 nights at Dan's apartment over the weekend and it was fantastic. Great location, walking distance to downtown and basically anything that you need in the city. The apartment is very spacious and clean, with 2 rooms and a large living room and one bath. All of the amenities were provided that you would need. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a downtown Seattle location! "
8372038,55766162,2015-12-05,19013007,Lynn,Dan's apt worked out great for one night.  Three of us had a Christmas party downtown Seattle and didn't want to drive home to the south end. The apt was roomy and convenient. Street parking worked out great and there was plenty of it. Keurig in the morning was nice!  Was surprised how quiet it was inside despite being so close to the freeway.   Dan was great at communicating.   We would return if we needed to stay downtown again. 
8372038,56101312,2015-12-08,28481217,Hanh,Great stay with no problems. Dan was very nice and accommodating--especially at the last minute. Place had everything you needed. At a great location that is within walking distance of many attractions. Thanks for a lovely stay! 
8372038,56172623,2015-12-09,44226121,Khoo,"Dan was very helpful and flexible with the time of check I. Place was clean, plenty of room. There was a basketball arcade game thing which was fun too! Great place in general."
8372038,56386262,2015-12-13,38412103,Lucia,Dan was an incredible host. He responded to every email and text message before and during our stay. Our four night stay was amazing. Everything about the listing is accurate. Amazing location and very close to anything you might need. The apartment is spacious and clean. 
8372038,56572746,2015-12-14,50786493,Joanne,"Great location, first time using Airbnb, satisfied customer."
8372038,56705507,2015-12-16,51178094,Valente,It was Gouda.
8372038,56761031,2015-12-17,19193647,Ziwei,it's nice a nice place to stay. Plenty of space! Good location. Owner helps us to find his apartment even it's almost midnight! If you plan to leave early in the morning you should be fine. Because there is no free parking for the apartment. So we park on the street and get up at 8am to pay for two hours. Other than that it's all good!
8372038,56944759,2015-12-20,25208235,Dominik,Dan was so helpful and a great host! Thankyou
8372038,57324950,2015-12-24,42434797,Julie,"Dan was at the ready if we needed anything.  If you go with kids, the basketball game is a big hit. "
8372038,57691815,2015-12-28,50595824,Amber,Awesome location. Big space. I would totally stay there again. 
8372038,57812443,2015-12-29,3704980,Emily,The apartment is very spacious and in a great location. Dan was accommodating and always quick to respond.
9075558,53153820,2015-11-05,36815660,Adam,"Accommodation was alright, bed was ok and location very close to downtown. Unfortunately host wasn't at home when we arrived so the room was dirty after last guest and bathroom as well. We had to change our bed linen to clean one (not really sure if it was clean). Benefits are location and price but overall impression is below the average."
9075558,53313026,2015-11-07,22224146,William,The room was dirty and it appeared the sheets had not been changed or cleaned. The rest of the house was also not cleaned recently. I only needed a place to crash for the night so was not expecting much. Mostafa was very responsive when contacted or called upon. I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone else to do so. 
9075558,53667699,2015-11-10,21105463,Kristen,"Mostafa was always quick to respond and was there to greet us upon arrival.  The home is new and looks appealing from the outside.  It's tucked away and behind some other town homes so you can't see it from the street.  We picked this place because of the price and literally just needed a place to stay for one night.  This is all I would recommend this place for, a place to sleep and that's all.  The home is shared with young adults (maybe mid 20's) and the upstairs (living and kitchen area) is very cluttered and messy.  The bedroom itself had furniture stacked all around and a bike hanging out.  This room was apparently also used for storage.  It was very plain and not very welcoming.  The bathroom was dirty and messy, no towels were provided to us either.  I looked for some but there was only 1 used one, no others were to be found. "
9075558,54564940,2015-11-21,16113799,Forrest,"Mostafa's home was affordable and conveniently located in a quiet place of town near easy and quick access into downtown. Other reviews have mentioned that the room was clean, but this is my second time staying there and I've not had an issue. I've personally seen mostafa changing the linens. There's a bit of temporary clutter in the room, but for the price, it's hard to beat. "
9075558,54682263,2015-11-22,19472385,Stephanie,The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The townhouse is very new and spacious. We didn't get to meet Mostafa because we were out and about but he was available and helpful through e-mail. His roommates were also very helpful. 
9075558,55669232,2015-12-04,20942635,Monique,"Mostafa was really helpful during my stay. He responded promptly to my emails and made the ""check in"" process very efficient. He even let me store my food in his fridge. The room was very nice and looked just like the pictures. Even though there are some chairs stacked on the side and the closet was quite full, the space was just enough for my one night stay. The only thing that would have made the stay better was a thicker warmer blanket. The room can be quite chilly in the winter time so be prepared!"
5670781,41036040,2015-08-03,4226718,Rachel,"Our experience was wonderful. Honara's house is beautiful, very tidy, and conveniently located. The backyard is a dream. Checking in was incredibly easy and stress free. Honora was very helpful and kind. Would absolutely stay again! "
5670781,42329174,2015-08-12,39944428,Charles,"Great location in the heart of Seattle. 
Has everything we needed just like our home! "
5670781,44453028,2015-08-26,22349522,Nina,"Great place located minutes from downtown Seattle.  House is just as presented.  I was a little nervous about the neighborhood at first, but it is very quiet and we felt very safe.  Older homes that have been fixed up or are being fixed up.  Very charming neighborhood.  Honora's house was clean, organized and tidy.  Beds were comfy and she left extra blankets if needed. We appreciated the great notes for the house and suggestions for places to eat in the neighborhood.  We walked to the Thai restaurant she suggested around the corner for lunch and loved it.  We were invited to eat pears from the backyard trees and got to know the neighborhood cat, Ruby.  We would definitely stay there again."
5670781,48706776,2015-09-28,18334221,Robert,"Honora was a wonderful and responsive host. Every questions I asked was responded to quickly and with all the information I needed. 

The house was wonderful. It has all the charm of the historic neighborhood with updated appliances. The stove, oven and TV were all new and there was plenty of hot water in the shower for our group of four. Our beds were comfortable and we couldn't have wanted for anything. 

The great thing about the house's location is that it is so walkable. We walked to many great local businesses for our morning coffee or the bottle shop. 

If you are staying in Seattle, this is the place for you!"
5670781,49777598,2015-10-06,7076478,Kelly,"Listing very accurate, Honora checked in to make sure we were ok."
5670781,50634642,2015-10-13,5054047,Kathleen & Ershad,"Honora was a great host! Her home was very clean, comfortable and welcoming. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking at home. The beds were really comfortable. The neighbourhood had good transit links to downtown and Capital Hill. There were grocery stores within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this listing to others!"
5670781,51283836,2015-10-19,8934462,Stephanie,"Honora was a great host! She was very responsive before and during our stay. I asked lots of random questions about the house and she seemed happy to answer all them. The house is a good central location, close to the bus system and accessible by car. "
5670781,52059869,2015-10-26,33618208,Sara,"My family stayed at Honora's home for two nights just this last weekend.  The listing was very accurate, and the house felt like home (except that it was scrupulously clean, which cannot be said about our home). The kitchen was well set-up for cooking (the knives were even sharp, hoorah!), the living room was very comfy, and everything about the house just felt like it had been given careful thought. There were games and DVDs available that had clearly been chosen to meet the needs of a variety of guests (my kids tried very hard to convince us that we should spend all our time in Seattle just hanging around the house). The keypad set up was really convenient, and the house notebook was clear and helpful. We would absolutely stay again."
5670781,53079826,2015-11-04,2207895,Andria,"Honora was a responsive and friendly host. Her house was really wonderful and perfect for our families with kids. 

The neighborhood is incredibly charming and close to many city options and attractions, but also close the amenities needed when you rent a home like grocery stores. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were so pleased with Honora's property. "
5670781,54718982,2015-11-23,21499480,Laura,"The listing was very accurate. We were close to everything we wanted to visit on our trip to Seattle. The house was very charming, warm and welcoming!! "

5670781,55353168,2015-12-01,41912934,Cierra,Honora provided thorough instructions regarding access and use of her beautiful home. The key pad was really convenient and we loved watching the hummingbirds over breakfast. 
5670781,55894773,2015-12-07,10002106,Sarah,"Honora was a great host, her welcome book laid everything out nicely for us and it was easy to know what to do at the house. The sheets on all of the bed were really nice...I'm going to try and find them to buy for my house!

The beds are very comfortable and the house is a perfect size for six or more people (we only had four).

It has everything you need in order to be comfortable and cook for yourself, all the appliances are in great condition and everything was very clean.

The neighborhood was quiet and close to where our relatives live so it was a perfect place to stay for us.

I would stay here again for sure."
5670781,57136496,2015-12-22,27335698,Bart,"We, a family of  four, stayed at Honora's home for three nights. It was exactly what we were looking for. All is nice, warm, clean and convenient. There are some nice games to play and DVD's to watch if you want. We were out most of the day and took a taxi to and from downtown. We enjoyed our stay with Honora and had a great time in Seattle. We all liked visiting the ""Flight Museum"" the most."
5670781,57753669,2015-12-29,11517999,Karol,"What a delight to stay in Honora's adorable home. We found it to be so much more than she described in the listing. We have stayed in other homes in Seattle and Honora's is our favorite!

The three nicely appointed bedrooms and two full baths easily accommodated three adults. The home was warm on rainy, damp days and had wonderful windows for light and sights. The backyard was private and lovely. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare quick meals and holiday feasts.

The neighborhood is convenient to downtown, the lake, freeway entrances and fun restaurants and attractions. The eclectic feel of the surrounding homes is fun. We felt very safe, and parking was easily available.

We will definitely be back!"
6226666,36234702,2015-06-26,15550980,Isik,"My wife and I stayed for four days in this great home. It's easy to find, and checking in was super easy with the key made available in a lockbox. Our host was rapidly responsive and everything was just an Uber away. Most importantly, the place was very clean with fresh towels and toiletries left for us. Would definitely recommend it for others!"
6226666,37792973,2015-07-10,36985382,Super,"The ad reflects this condo exactly. Nice building, great neighborhood. Condo was very clean and the clean towels were appreciated. Kitchen was very functional and the bathroom was as well. Thank you very much!"
3005854,13941019,2014-06-08,15935494,Christian,"Krystle was a great host. She was flexible about my check-in time. The couch is comfy and the provided towels were awesome too! A+ location right on Alki Beach. For the low budget traveller, this is a solid option. I had a medical emergency and so wasn't able to stay for my full three day reservation so this is only speaking of one night stay."
3005854,14377463,2014-06-17,733410,Myles,"Simple living.
Great place to stay near the beach for my 5 day visit. Krystle was very friendly and accommodating. I would gladly recommend that anyone stay there if they're on a budget. Place really is just across the street from Alki beach, very close to shops, food and Seattle transit bus lines."
3005854,14591306,2014-06-22,17035952,Павел,"I had a last minute decision to visit Seattle, and then realized that every hotel is booked up. I started looking at airbnb and found Krystle's lodging ad. Glad I did!

Her couch is long, so it accommodated my tall body just fine. Her floor is carpeted, and she has plenty of blankets for the a second spot on the floor if there is a second person staying. Her living room is nice and quiet, so I got a great nights sleep. There is full furnished kitchen available, as well as private bathroom. Its safe, secure and private. Krystle is very nice and accommodating. 

The best part is-her location, which is right on Alki beach. Great place to stay, and beautiful mornings when the weather is nice, morning walk on the beach is must. 
   I will definitely stay there again!"
3005854,15075873,2014-07-01,17178403,Hero,"Krystle was great! Her house was clean and cozy. It really is right near the beach, which is beauuuuuutiful. And there's a busstop right there too so you can get around easily. She was friendly and helpful. She even saved the day when I showed up late and missed the last bus. I would definitely recommend staying with her next time you're in Seattle. :] "
3005854,15507246,2014-07-10,17051251,Kathy,"To borrow from realtor parlance, it's all about location, location, location!  To that I would also add hostess with the mostest! The apartment is literally steps from the beach with immediate access to the multi-use Alki trail, picnic/barbecue/bonfire facilities, and a variety of cafe's, bars, and restaurants.  Alki Beach is a charming town in West Seattle that appeals to families and people of all ages.  The Alki trail is a flat, coastal, multi-use trail that is easy to bike and offers beautiful views of downtown and the harbor.  
Kris is a very accommodating and generous host.  She provided me with a key for 24 hour access, kitchen and laundry privileges, and a comfortable couch for sleeping.  It is a one bedroom, one bathroom, basement level apartment, probably 1970's era, with a combined living/kitchen space so there is no real expectation of privacy but Kris is very respectful of the shared space and really extends herself on behalf of her guest.  I walked to the water taxi (about 1/2 hour walk) to access downtown Seattle but there is also a bus stop on the corner so a car is not necessary. 
This was both my first Airbnb booking and my first couch surfing experience so I had some trepidation about safety.  I took a chance based on positive earlier reviews and a willingness to lose my money and bail out if I didn't feel safe.  Needless to say, there are no worries on that account.  Kris offers a sweet deal if you want to be in West Seattle to enjoy a beach experience and really just need a safe, comfortable space to land at night."
8193332,55362560,2015-12-01,229091,Oliver,"We stayed in Herry's apartment for a month in November, and it was exactly what we were looking for! The locations is fantastic, super close to Fremont, Queen Anne and Ballard, and the apartment has everything that you need. Herry was great and made the whole process very easy. "
6364753,35520584,2015-06-19,25567975,Morgan,"The house was as beautiful in person as the pictures show. The instructions that Kristjan left were clear and helpful and free parking was plentiful and close. 
I loved that the kitchen is clearly used by someone who cooks and was well stocked with all-clad pots and had a gas range! And having Fred Meyer literally in the backyard was helpful too. The chocolate and wine left for us (although unfortunately we don't drink) were a nice touch."
6364753,35811423,2015-06-22,33287632,Joe,"Great experience! Kristjan sent us a detailed guide to getting into the house and a breakdown of the neighborhood and all his favorite things around Seattle. Great neighborhood to stay in and a very clean, nice home. Everything was great."
6364753,36120653,2015-06-25,24480505,Carla,"Absolutely loved Kristjan's home, a beautiful light filled place with everything we needed and more. We especially enjoyed being welcomed with fresh flowers and wine. We didn't meet Kristjan, but he was attentive to questions and details on his place and the neighborhood full of fun shops and restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommend."
6364753,36437486,2015-06-28,3934348,Thao,"Kristen's place is absolute CLASS! Everything was provided, and it really was like a home away from home. Awesome neighborhood and area! Definitely would stay here again! Thanks so much! Cheers :)"
9473967,56766712,2015-12-17,50167865,Rob,"Eric was a great host and I really enjoyed having electronic access to the building and the room. The roof and kitchen access was a great plus, with fantastic views of the city!

The room was clean and nearly prepared, plenty of outlets and a nice view outside the windows. 

Highly recommend!"
9473967,57450868,2015-12-26,45929533,Timothy,We got this room for my parents while they were visiting us and they absolutely loved it. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The other people who live in the building are nice and helpful. I have stayed at several Airbnbs in Seattle and this micro studio is my favorite. We celebrated Christmas dinner in one of the common area kitchens and invited several other residents to join us. It was a perfect stay. Thank you
1747184,14853907,2014-06-28,12387633,Jacob,What a gem! The view is awesome and the location is even better. Seems like its 5 minutes from almost everything. Slept the 7 of us no problem and the baby room came in handy big time. It was definitely easier than staying in a hotel and a lot nicer too. All the comforts of home!
1747184,14945129,2014-06-30,2300965,Sarah,We loved staying at Heather and Mike's place. They always responded right away when trying to book their place and the place was the perfect location to get to everything and had a fabulous view! We were a party of 6 adults and 7 small kids and it was the perfect size for all of us. Each family had two bedrooms on separate floors with our own bathrooms. Much better for hanging out once kids were in bed than a hotel would have been. It was so nice to have kids toys and cribs/high chairs and such to make it an easier stay. Would highly recommend staying here. 
1747184,15221046,2014-07-05,15333790,Jen,"What a fantastic AirBnB find! We stayed 4 nights in early July 2014. Our group was two families (with 2 kids in one, 1 baby in the other). The house was the perfect set up for us, with each family having their own floor. The house is in a great location down by the water and the views are gorgeous, especially in the early evening. We found it easy to travel downtown by public transport from the house. The house is simply furnished but feels really comfortable. Very clean and tidy and lovely attention to detail like good quality linen/towels. Heather was a gem to deal with and we would definitely recommend this house to our friends. Oh and heaps of toys for our toddler and babies to enjoy- thanks Eleni for sharing! "
1747184,15409220,2014-07-08,16327668,Sara,"The house is great, and conveniently located for fun in Seattle! Great views from all the big windows.
"
1747184,15902575,2014-07-18,4499696,Tim And Rebecca,"We had a great Six Days in Seattle and Mike and Heather's roomy house was key to this. We had a family reunion with a bunch of little cousins getting acquainted the first time three levels with lots of bedrooms, bathrooms, and tot closets made it great. For the adults the balcony upstairs with views of Seattle, the Space Needle, and pontoon boats taking of before our eyes was great. Relaxing while our three musical son's played their guitars and ukuleles and we all sang or played games made us feel right at home. The nearby walks along Lake Union and to Fremont to see the Troll and Lenin's statue or to fly kites and launch rockets at the old gas works with great views of Seattle would have convinced most that Seattle is the  place to be, if it weren't for the complicated recycling system and the knowledge we were there during the only 6 consecutive sunny days of the year. The entry system, the fresh towels and linens, the toiletries and big world map, the wine and chocolates, the house manual with brochures, passcodes,, the  careful instructions and even the fan that arrived while we were there all were extras that helped us feel right at home.  We would very much recommend this stay."
1747184,16072787,2014-07-22,12165090,Christie,"We could not have asked for a better house, location or host.  The house was extremely spacious, comfortable, and steps from Lake Union.  It slept all of us easily, and the views from the second and third floors were spectacular!  The baby room was PERFECT for our 11 month old - and there were plenty of toys, books, baby gear, feeding supplies, etc.  It made our first trip with our baby a breeze! 

Wallingford is a great town, full of amazing restaurants and shops - and very close to downtown and other beautiful Seattle neighborhoods.

Heather and Mike were easy to contact and replied to any questions we had promptly.  I would definitely recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle and we will surely return soon!
