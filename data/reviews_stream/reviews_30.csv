25002,3652145,2013-02-28,2441459,Rachel,"We absolutely loved our time in Ballard at Amanda's place! We arrived at the apartment in the middle of the night and were met by a beautiful apartment and a much-welcome plate of brownies! We met Amanda in person the next day and she was very helpful in recommending local restaurants, markets and the best bits of Seattle to see. Ballard is a lovely area and Amanda is a lovely host, we would definitely recommend her place to visitors to Seattle!"
25002,3682485,2013-03-04,4428991,Mark,This place was exactly as advertised. Amanda was an excellent host. My family had an excellent stay.
25002,3701092,2013-03-05,3755213,Dominique,"Comfortable, clean and neat place. Liked  the decoration, with just the right touch of the cozy american style. Appreciated a lot the home made brownies and note as welcome. And everything was here for any hot beverages.
Could be a bit far from dowtown if no means of transport, but not a problem with our rental car. And very well localized for a family visit to the near beautiful zoo of seattle.
We had rented for one night only and arrived much later than expected (sorry for that). But I think Amanda nicely waited for us, and even if we could have discussed only a few minutes (our son was falling asleep). We like this ""couch"" spirit..
Thanks a lot. To be recommended !"
25002,3732603,2013-03-09,5269450,Scott,Amanda's place was fantastic. It was very comfortable for two people and felt like we were staying in an apartment rather than a hotel room. It is very private and the amenities are excellent. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Seattle.
25002,3771658,2013-03-13,4577236,Kelly,Amanda's place was perfect! Super cute and in the perfect location. Several little restaurants that were in walking distance ended up being our favorite in Seattle! Amanda is so sweet and had brownies for us... twice. Can't recommend her highly enough!
25002,3852669,2013-03-21,2394847,Sung,"I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Seattle many thanks to the wonderful accommodations at Amanda's Ballard home.  I was getting around mostly by public transport and getting to downtown, UW and elsewhere was easy and straightforward.  Wonderful cafe, restaurant and shopping options within Ballard as well.  Amanda is a wonderful host and I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle."
25002,3935474,2013-03-29,3078572,Courtney,"Amanda was a gracious host, leaving brownies for us on arrival and quick to respond to our text messages. The room was very comfortable, spacious and so clean! I took a nice bath to relax. The neighborhood was nice and safe. Would highly recommend this space to friends."
25002,3964055,2013-03-31,3405282,Kris,"It's a gem. Amanda was a wonderful, friendly host and the room is huge, bright, and with everything you could possibly need. Spotless, quiet and great neighborhood. "
25002,4044749,2013-04-05,5105363,Stephanie,Thanks Amanda for hosting us.  We loved the quiet neighborhood lined with the blossoming cherry trees!  It is very conveniently located to Ballard and to downtown.
25002,4097825,2013-04-09,262611,Jane,"Amanda's polace was great. We are super private and that is just what we got. Amanda poked her head out to say hello and I am sure we could have gotten tons of info from her. This neighborhood is great and there are so many great places to eat, Hoinore, Fat Hen, El Camio, Delancy. If you did not want to leave this neighborhood, you would not have to. Everything was super clean and there were brownies when we got there! This place will definetley be on our Seattle list of places to stay!"
25002,4127145,2013-04-12,5384018,Esther,"Amanda's place was lovely.  It was the perfect for us.  She is a wonderful host and even though we didn't have a chance to meet her, we felt welcomed by her personal note and brownies!  It has a cozy feel, she provided fresh towels, hair dryer, coffee, cable TV and wifi. 
I would recommend Amanda's home.  I will definately plan to stay again.  Thanks Amanda!!"
25002,4143340,2013-04-13,3152109,Jennifer,"Amanda was a great host!  The room was exactly as listed, clean and comfortable. We were also given great advice on the type of restaurant we were looking for. Ballard IS beautiful, quiet, and friendly - and staying at Amanda's is a great way to see it. We would definitely stay again."
25002,4185626,2013-04-16,371683,Kelly,"We had an awesome 3 night stay in Ballard last weekend.  Couldn't have asked for a better neighborhood location!  Amanda was a wonderful host, even though we never actually met her during our stay.  She made check in & out easy and left us a sweet welcome treat.  We had all the privacy we needed, but having Amanda right upstairs made us feel well taken care of if we were to need anything.

The room is just as it appears in pictures.  We had all the amenities we cold have needed on a 4 day vacation - mini fridge, coffe & tea supplies, water filter.  There is plenty of closet space and the room is quite spacious with a nice couch/sitting area.  While the room itself was great, I think our favorite part was the bathroom - heated floors were quite a luxury for us!

On the neighborhood - it's absolutely lovely. We could have stayed in Ballard the whole time and never been bored!  On our list of placed we explored (and loved): Sunday morning farmer's market, Ballard Locks, Golden Gardens Park (great beach for a walk, nice park for kids), downtown restaurants and shops.  Plus, right down the street is a cute little collection of fabulous restaurants/bakeries mentioned by Amanda in her description - Honore, Fat Hen, and Delancey.  Be sure to check these out.

A final note - We used Car2Go for transportation and were always able to find one relatively close.

We would definitely recommend staying with Amanda and plan to stay there again if we ever are able to make another trip to Seattle."
25002,4310264,2013-04-27,3071244,Kim,"Amanda's place is as lovely as everyone says. It is conveniently located and very comfortable, and she provided the usual - very delicious! - brownies. Amanda was a very charming host and was very willing to provide advice and recommendations. I would thoroughly recommend Honore for coffee and pastries and Delancey for fabulous pizzas and very good service (we loved our dinner here so much, we returned the next night too)."
25002,4337441,2013-04-29,196917,Eunyoung,This place is lovely! Amanda welcomed us with a personal note and brownies and was very accommodating. We had everything we needed to be comfortable. Highly recommended!
25002,4399427,2013-05-02,2592419,Margo,"Amanda's place was just wonderful.  The neighborhood was so lovely and quiet and her apartment was very clean and sweetly decorated.  The bed was so comfy that I slept like an angel.  There were restaurants and local shops very close to browse and have a nice mean.  I would look forward to staying at Amanda's again in the future.  Thanks, Amanda.  Margo"
25002,4414901,2013-05-04,788444,Evelina,"A perfect place to stay for a couple of days!
Yes, Amanda makes brownies, and yes, they are delicious! Go ahead and ask her about where to go and what to eat - she knows everything!
Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood, quiet and peaceful, with some awesome cafes and boutiques right round the corner; the accommodation is perfectly clean and sunny, with a lovely comfy bed, and even a TV.
Loads of parking available outside.  
Nothing else to wish for! Would stay here again anytime!"
25002,4474410,2013-05-07,5540194,Linda,"We had a great time at Amanda's.  The bed is comfortable, the space is well thought out, and we had everything we needed.
She is a thoughtful hostess -- we loved the fresh flowers and brownies!"

25002,4544003,2013-05-12,1641086,William,Thanks Amanda. Our stay was wonderful. We will be back.
25002,4774296,2013-05-25,6089768,Chris,"Great, comfortable space.  Cozy, on a quiet street.  Nice bathroom.  Owner very freindly, but not intrusive.  Would stay again."
25002,4865306,2013-05-29,602415,Carolyn,"Although we had a short stay and did not have have the pleasure of meeting Amanda, but her apartment was perfect for our needs! Clean, spacious, and in a cute/convenient Ballard neighborhood (email hidden)d the delicious walnut brownies were a sweet (in both meanings of the word) touch!"

25002,5046012,2013-06-09,6295578,Jonathan,"Amanda was a great host and even left brownies! The room and bathroom are clean and comfortable, and it's a great location. Definitely a value!"
25002,5079152,2013-06-11,5696418,Katie,"We were visiting Seattle for graduation and this was the perfect place to stay! The room is beautiful and well-kept with lots of room, and very comfortable, There was room inside and out to have our whole family hang out, not to mention the free wifi, outdoor space, free parking, and a great neighborhood. The distance to other neighborhoods is also perfect. We could not have gotten a hotel to match this room!"
25002,5225616,2013-06-19,5389270,Malathi,"very nice, clean and comfortable place. Very private. Parking space. Welcome letter, yummy brownies and fruit basket. excellent value.
Great place to stay. Will be back"
25002,5260075,2013-06-21,6135346,Patty,"Amanda's place was awesome and was one of our favorite places to stay during our roadtrip. Her place felt like a home but with the amenities of a hotel. (the bathroom floor was heated!) 

There were three of us and we were all very comfortable. It was in a great neighborhood with many popular restaurants nearby. As other reviews had mentioned, she made some delicious brownies for us. I would not hesitate to stay at her place if we visited Seattle again. "
25002,5394166,2013-06-28,5747197,Antje,"Amanda's Place is great. Amanda is a very nice and helpful host. On arrival a plate with self made very delicious brownies was waiting for us. she even drove us to downtown Ballard and to the Skytrain station when we left.
The apartment is as described. There are no eal cooking facilities but there is a fridge and a microwave.

The bed is very comfortable. The apartment is not that close to downtown but there is a bus station close by (5 minute walking distance) that goes straight to downtown in roughly 35 minutes. downtown Ballard is in walking distance (20 minutes)."
25002,5450412,2013-07-01,5784532,Christina,Thank you Amanda for being such an excellent host! My mother loved your space and she has already told me she wants to come back. She enjoyed your delicious brownies and felt very safe and comfortable there. I will definitely tell my friends from out of town about your wonderful place. xoxo
25002,5555305,2013-07-06,5486805,Connie,"Thank you, Amanda, for a relaxing place to stay during our visit to Seattle.  Your quiet hospitality was evident in all the little things you provide, especially the fruit and brownies!"
25002,5598739,2013-07-08,2645922,Renee,"Super pleasant! The space was quiet and serene; the bed was incredibly comfortable; Amanda was really nice to meet and talk to; and the brownies and organic cherries were such a welcoming touch. The neighborhood is lovely, with lots of gardens and birds, and a little strip with a fantastic bakery (Honore), pizzeria (Delancey), and bar (Essex) within a few blocks. This place is a gem. 

"
25002,6099460,2013-07-30,4699461,Matt,We loved staying with Amanda while we were studying in Ballard for 3 weeks. Her place is comfortable and Amanda was very helpful and friendly. If you're there in summer you'll see her beautiful dahlias too. She's an easy walk from the centre of Ballard and you can get to the centre of Seattle easily with the express bus from only a few blocks away. Highly recommended - thank you Amanda. 
25002,6234194,2013-08-05,4484351,Paul,"We loved staying at Amanda's place. It was clean, quiet and had everything we needed.  The brownies were fantastic, the bouquet of flowers was lovely, the beds were comfy, and the location was perfect!  Amanda was a great host. I give this place five stars!!!!!!!!"
25002,6362087,2013-08-10,5133724,Emily,"We had a blast staying here! The location was great. The neighborhood is so cute, and it was very quiet (mostly families with young kids). There were great restaurants only a few blocks from her house, some of the best in Seattle. There was easy access to bus lines, especially if you are looking for Fremont, U District, and downtown. Amanda was also delightful and offered advice about what to see and do along with coupons when we told her what we wanted to do. The brownies when we arrived were an added bonus! This was our first Airbnb experience, and now we are true believers!"
25002,6530547,2013-08-16,6388657,Joanna,"Amanda was communicative, welcoming, and generous.  The pictures accurately reflected the rooms we inhabited.  They were clean, cute, and well-stocked with little extras for use and guides for navigation.  We felt as though we had a comfortable home base while exploring a new environment.  It was particularly wonderful to have access to her compost bin in addition to the standard trash and recycling receptacles.  

The bouquets of homegrown flowers were stunning, and her brownies were fudge-i-licious!  She should not be limited by people's expectations for these brownies, as we also learned she makes a killer zucchini bread!  

We recommend Amanda's accommodations without hesitation, and we will be sure to see if she has any availability should we visit Seattle in the future - providing she will have us, of course!"
25002,6569090,2013-08-17,7881741,Angela,Their place is super warm and cozy. The even had brownies laid out for us on the table upon arrival. They have a beautiful Dahlia garden which they use to decorate the house in pots. I loved their cozy home and would definitely stay there again!
25002,6609940,2013-08-19,1647594,Lorie,"Amanda was a great host! Seattle was a bit warm when I visited and all I had to do was ask for a fan and there she was with it! :)  The brownies were delicious and her dahlias were just brilliant!

The room is a garage conversion but doesn't feel like it at all. It's very sunny in the room,there's a fridge, tv and microwave. The bathroom is across the hall and has a heated floor!

Everything was clean and in top shape. I'll certainly try to stay here again on a future visit.
"
25002,6727403,2013-08-23,5884602,Anna,"Great little place.  The photos don't even show half of how cosy it was.  A nice sofa to sit in the evenings, a REALLY comfy bed (just what you need after 24 hours of travelling) and awesome shower.

Amanda had baked us brownies and left us a note. She's super friendly and helpful, she even let us do a load of washing.

The place is fully kitted out, shampoo, razors, toothpaste and hair dryer in the bathroom. Tea, coffee and milk in the fridge.

Theres a place to park on the drive or plenty of street parking. It's also a short walk from shops, cafes and gas. 

I would 100% recommend this place."
25002,7005150,2013-09-03,5697329,Ashley,"Amanda space is exactly what she shows! The heated floor in the bathroom & brownies were an extra touch. Her place is great access to everything; interstate, shopping, grocery stores, and restaurants."
25002,7074723,2013-09-05,1552065,Kristin,"Amanda's space in Ballard was the perfect place for my Seattle get-away!  The room was comfortable, spacious, and fresh.  Amanda's welcome note and brownies were such a nice touch.  Her front yard was filled with colorful flowers, and her home was just a short walk to shopping and dining.  I'd definitely recommend."
25002,7191699,2013-09-10,6687337,Jean,"Lovely stay at Amanda's. We arrived a little late, after dark, but she had lights around the doorway which made it easy to identify her home.  Her place was as described and the beds were comfortable. 
My husband loved the fresh baked brownies! Thanks Amanda.
"
25002,7223910,2013-09-11,6816128,Sigríður María,"We only stayed one night, but we couldn't have been more pleased.  The apartment is very cute and clean, the bed very comfortable, and our 19 year old son slept well on the sofabed.  Amanda was very friendly and directed us to a good Mexican restaurant in the neighbourhood. She had also put beautiful fresh flowers from the garden in a vase and when we arrived there were delicious brownies on a plate waiting for us. We wouldn't have minded staying longer."
25002,7271623,2013-09-14,1606649,Jim&Carol,Amanda's accomodations for guests are perfect.  She offers a private space that's roomy and comfortable and private.  She has lovely dahlias blooming out front and cut dahlias in vases inside.  Brownies tasted wonderful!  She dropped in shortly after we arrived and told us about herself and her daughter and about Seattle.  Her suggestions for sights to see and restaurants were very helpful.  I cannot think of one thing my husband or I needed that she didn't provide.  A wonderful place and a wonderful host.  What more could anyone ask?I  
25002,7291734,2013-09-14,6782575,Jessica,We had such a great stay here! Amanda was very helpful and her place was very comfortable! We hope to stay here  with every trip up to Seattle. 
25002,7431380,2013-09-20,925945,Chieh,Amanda was a gracious host. The room and bathroom were super clean and comfortable. Lovely amenities. Many  small little things that were a lovely touch for travelers who have been on the road for a while. Check in and out process really easy. Good access to public transport - takes 1/2 hour to get to downtown on D line bus. Lovely quiet suburb. Can't say enough good things about this place. Highest recommendation if you are planning to visit Seattle and want to stay in a nice suburb away from the hustle and bustle. We had a car and could park it in the driveway which was very convenient. Very contented sun baking cats looked at us every morning from inside the house as we exited our room. Would love to stay here if we visit Seattle again.
25002,7467534,2013-09-21,8671134,Emily,"We loved our stay! Fresh brownies in the room upon arrival, relaxed and cute little room, really nice neighborhood. We didn't get a chance to meet Amanda but she was very accommodating nonetheless, calling to make sure we got in okay and leaving clear instructions. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
25002,7480997,2013-09-22,2559467,Jimmy,"Lovely, quiet, clean room. Ample street parking. Delicious brownies. We plan on staying here with our next visit."
25002,7553056,2013-09-24,7987345,Kendalyn,"We had such a great time staying with Amanda! The unit was quite comfortable and spacious, and the location was awesome. We were able to walk to some really yummy and fun places like Delancey's (great drinks and pizza!), and it was just a short drive into downtown Seattle. Amanda provided us with some wonderful suggestions for places to eat and things to do including the Ballard Farmer's Market, which was voted best in the state. It definitely lived up to the title! I think the market was one of our favorite things about Seattle, next to Pike Place Market of course. Amanda even left us some brownies as treats upon our arrival, and there was a well-stocked area with coffee and tea. The fridge and microwave also came in handy. She was available for us when we needed anything and was a wonderful host. We would definitely stay here again!"
25002,7592626,2013-09-25,8923722,Paula,"This was my first airbnb stay, and it was a great one!  Very easy to coordinate with Amanda.  Her place was truly beautiful and quiet.  Very comfortable, with a welcoming and cozy feel.  Within walking distance to more places than you would think, given that it is in a residential area.  "
25002,7625234,2013-09-27,5556808,Lily,"I stayed at Amanda's place for one night with three other friends and we loved it! The whole space was very clean with lots of privacy. The beds were comfy, even the pull-out! I especially loved that there were organic teas, coffee and SOY MILK(being vegan and all)! It really warms my heart when a host goes the extra mile to accommodate all needs. I would love to stay with Amanda again for my next visit."
25002,7691016,2013-09-30,5189389,Dan,"It was just as all the others have said...""All the comforts of home""!  The bed was very comfortable, nice desk/table for computer work, etc.. (wifi worked perfectly), comfortable couch for watching TV (HD picture a bonus of a rain-soaked day) or for eating (on TV tables no less). Made good use of the microwave and refrigerator, and Amanda has provided a more than adequate supply of dishes, glasses, and silverware, along with a good selection of teas, and even some soy milk in the frig.  There are lots of lights in the room, so you can read/work wherever you'd want, and you have control of the temperature with a nice space heater.  The bathroom is only 2 steps outside your room, and it was well-stocked and spotless. The shower had plenty of hot water (and water power), and Amanda provides soap, shampoo, conditioner, towels (I haven't had a bad experience at any previous Airbnb stay, but Amanda definitely goes above and beyond expectations to make your stay comfortable.)
Parking was convenient (driveway, or right in front on the street), and it was an easy 4-block walk to catch a bus straight to downtown (much easier than trying to park in downtown Seattle).
There is no traffic noise, and the house was also very quiet.
I'd definitely look forward to another stay in ""Friendly Ballard""...Thanks, Amanda !"
25002,7980098,2013-10-11,8110032,Brittney,"AMAZING!!!  Our stay was perfect.  It was easy to check in, comfortable bed (with incredible pillows!), everything we could possibly need, yummy brownies waiting for us, quiet neighborhood near public transportation and amazing food.  The room was clean and great!  
Amanda was a great host and extremely friendly. 
p.s. the picture shows a small tv but they upgraded to a larger flat screen that can be viewed from the couch or the bed- it was a nice touch!"
25002,8011152,2013-10-12,111074,Maryrose,Amanda's house was quiet and comfortable. I love the radiant heat in the bathroom. It is like staying with friends. Recommended.
25002,8020832,2013-10-13,906806,Nanette,"Very large and comfortable space in nice neighborhood.  Well equiped with frig, coffee maker, hot water, plates/cutlery, tea and coffee.  Amanda was very communicative when we were making arrangement. Beautiful flower garden too.  "
25002,8195935,2013-10-20,1639347,Amy,"We had a wonderful stay in Ballard at Amanda's! Bill and I enjoy exploring neighborhoods in Seattle.  Ballard has the fascinating Ballard Locks, fine restaurants, neighborhood bakeries and eateries, beautiful dahlias, museums nearby, and an accessible city bus system. Everything in easy reach!  We will definitely return.
Amanda and her apartment were each as comfortable as we had hoped.  We met Amanda only once, and ""clicked"" and the place seemed to be ours--  becoming our home for four days.  Loved the warm bathroom floors--what an added luxury! We would recommend this location with the highest marks! Amy"
25002,8467194,2013-11-01,8078103,Dan,"Great place, good location, priced right, pleasant host.  I can recommend this place without reservation.  Heated floor in bathroom a nice amenity.

We thoroughly enjoyed our week-long stay. The place was comfy and clean with everything we needed. The welcome brownies were a nice surprise. We will stay again should the opportunity arise. Thank you Amanda."
25002,8724423,2013-11-13,7864590,Christie,"The best thing about this place was that I was greeted with homemade brownies. This place was clean, cozy, quiet, and had a comfortable bed and a great internet connection. I'll definitely be staying here again. "
25002,8749852,2013-11-16,6074644,Jenna,"We LOVED staying with Amanda in Ballard during our recent visit to Seattle! Her home was unbelievably comfortable and clean. We were welcomed with homemade vegan brownies and given excellent recommendations for vegetarian eats in the area. My partner and I make a trip to Seattle every year, and I look forward to staying here again next time!"
25002,8815413,2013-11-19,1716772,Tristan/Robert,Amanda's place was comfortable and conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. Amanda was easy to communicate with and I would definitely stay here again!

25002,9026307,2013-12-02,9701597,Bettie,"Amanda's converted garage apartment was clean and fresh. Best part was, although the bathroom was in another part of the garage (a few steps away) the floor was heated! I'd recommend it!"
25002,9265050,2013-12-17,8587297,Tana,"Amanda's was just what we needed when visiting Seattle for the birth of my grandson. My daughter and son in law live in the same area and was very easy coming and going. The room was large, clean and comfortable and it was nice to be able to buy some groceries and eat some simple meals there. If you get a chance go to the Fat Hen for breakfast...Delicious and a 5 minute walk! Honore is right across the street from the Fat Hen and has fabulous croissants. Both make an excellent latte. We will return!"
25002,9330436,2013-12-22,4200450,John,"Quiet, comfortable, and convenient. Our go to place in Seattle."
25002,9355898,2013-12-23,4243916,Joanne,"Amanda's place was clean and comfortable.  On a cold night, the room was warm, and we appreciated the electric kettle and tea. The location was perfect for our overnight stay in Ballard.  Amanda's communication with me was very good. Although we never met her in person, we felt welcome in her downstairs room.   "
25002,9422245,2013-12-28,587513,Susan,"My parents stayed with Amanda during the Chirstmas holiday. Her home apartment is very close to our home so it was convenient for their stay. Her place is large clean and very cozy. They were very happy with the bed and the spacious room.  Also the bathroom is well appointed.  Amanda was a a terrific host. We will definitely return for our out of town guests!
"
25002,9517572,2014-01-01,5035833,Patty,"Adorable.  Cozy.  Friendly.  Amanda was such a nice host and so giving in so many ways.   She found out we're vegan and left vegan cookies, and also soy milk in the fridge.  I love little details like that because it makes a difference in helping us to feel welcome.

Loved the organics throughout, including the shampoo and conditioner!  

Thanks, Amanda.  You are fab.  We WILL be back.  :)"
25002,9675133,2014-01-05,7864590,Christie,"I've stayed here 3 times and have loved it. Any issues were dealt with immediately, the place is sparkling clean, and there's a really good, ""homey"" vibe. I'll definitely stay again and would highly recommend it!"
25002,9868769,2014-01-15,5141166,Annie,"Amanda was a wonderful host--courteous, welcoming, helpful, and a great storyteller! Her home was even more cozy and lovely than the pictures (if that's possible!). You'll find her neighborhood perfect for walks, near quaint restaurants, and a perfect area to explore. I will definitely get in touch with Amanda the next time I'm in Seattle. "
25002,9922374,2014-01-19,11354854,Sally Thu,"Amanda's place was just lovely and cozy! The neighborhood was very clean and quiet. My friend and I loved it! Her place was well stocked and having a hair blow dryer in her bathroom was definitely a great perk! That's one less item for us girls to carry in our luggage. haha. Her place is very close to downtown and everything that Seattle is known for. 

Amanda is a great host! She made sure we were comfortable and was very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again when I come back! "
25002,10020898,2014-01-26,849407,Joni,We stayed at Amanda's for a week and loved it. It is a bright and cheery room with all the little amenities to make it feel like home. Bed was comfortable and neighborhood quiet so we slept well. Amanda is so accommodating and offered to let us use the washer and dryer which was great since we were there a week. The only negative was that her cats didn't come down to visit us
25002,10070752,2014-01-28,2206841,Blake,It was pleasure staying at Amanda's.  There were 3 of us who just needed a place to stay for the night.  It was very accommodating.
25002,10213954,2014-02-06,847387,Dave,"Amanda and her place were great!  Her house is on a really nice and quiet street in a fantastic area of Seattle (lots of great restaurants, coffee/tea shops, movie theater, etc close by).  Amanda was super nice and helpful explaining how we could catch the bus (very convenient and easy) to downtown Seattle.  We would definitely stay there again.      "
25002,10255880,2014-02-09,11984378,Jennifer,"Amanda was such a welcoming, responsive host!  She thinks through all the details to make your stay pleasant.  Her place is such a great deal."
25002,10308258,2014-02-12,9690412,Ashley,"We had such a wonderful time staying at Amanda's. Sadly we never met because of our crazy schedule, but I'm sure we would have been fast friends. Her place is located in a quiet neighborhood, close to several bus lines and some great restaurants. The Fat Hen, Delanceys, and Essex were amazing... and it only takes 15 min to get to downtown Seattle. The room is very cozy with everything you need, fridge, tea kettle, a very comfy and warm bed, and homemade brownies:), thanks Amanda! The bathroom is amazing with radiant floor heating and plenty of hot water. Amanda answered all of my crazy questions and was very helpful! I hope we can stay with her again the next time we visit. "
25002,10357437,2014-02-15,4693342,Scott,"We had a great time at Amanda's place in Ballard. We felt immensely welcome, we had a couple nice chats with Amanda and we were greeted with delicious brownies upon arrival. The room was comfortable, with lots of different surfaces to sit, lounge, and lay about on. It was also easy to feel ourselves at home there because there was a ton of storage to unpack into since the room's a dedicated guest room.

The heated floor in the bathroom is sooo good. Note that the bathroom is not in the room, but is just outside the door leading into the basement. It was really nice to have a private entrance and driveway. We were even lucky enough to get a short visit from her friendly cat!

The neighborhood is good, there's grocery stores and restaurants about a ten minute walk away. It is a bit of a hike from the core of downtown Ballard, but it's certainly walkable, and there's an easy bus for the less adventurous. Ballard is a hip Seattle neighborhood with many interesting businesses.

We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!"
25002,10463414,2014-02-20,10746160,Pat,"Our 5 night stay worked well for us as it was close to the family we were visiting. I loved taking a neighborhood walk each morning in this great and quiet location. I was happy to see many items provided, such as a plastic one-cup coffee filter & paper filters, a filtered water pitcher and use of the washer/dryer. Lighting in the room is excellent, both natural light and artificial lighting. We were surprised to find the private bathroom separate from the apartment, across a small walkway in the basement, though it posed no real problem for us. It did mean we had to take dishes to be washed either to the bath or basement laundry area to be cleaned. The apartment is definitely good value for the cost."
25002,10495492,2014-02-22,1877567,Eleni,"This is a very cozy place in a great neighborhood.  We could walk to the Fat Hen for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.
She left a basket of great toys for my kids.  The place was spotless, warm and she was very communicative.  I highly recommend staying here and hope to again next time we're in Seattle."
25002,10591150,2014-02-26,8500840,Brandee,"First time staying in Ballard area. Stayed one night en route back to Vancouver.

Amanda's place is a lovely space. No kitchen, but has microwave, fridge, kettle, and fixings for coffee & tea, even milk & soy milk! Great living space & comfortable bed. Washroom is in a different area of the basement.

Neighbourhood seems nice, enjoyed breakfast at a recommended place (The Fat Hen). We would love to stay longer next time & explore the neighbourhood. 

We didn't get a chance to meet Amanda, but she seems very sweet. There's some construction work in the basement, she was considerate in getting the workers to come after we left. Thanks for the brownies & fruit, hope to meet you next time! :) Highly recommend & would love to stay there again."
25002,10674492,2014-03-03,9564959,Kate,Beautiful place! Nice quiet location with free street parking and lots of great restaurants nearby. Had everything we needed and more! Loved everything about it!
25002,10735759,2014-03-04,12648143,Nora,"All the the previous reviews are spot on! Amanda was really nice and personable! The apt was perfect-cozy, relaxing, clean! I would love to stay here again my next time in Seattle! Thanks Amanda! "
25002,10790035,2014-03-07,2049764,Heather,Amanda's place was so cozy and inviting. I wished that my stay would have been longer but the one night I was there was restful and comfortable. I appreciated Amanda's warm welcome and the thought she put into making the space comfortable. Thanks for opening up your home to travelers. 
25002,10918027,2014-03-13,9515467,Emma,"Amanda is a really brilliant host - we loved her! We had nice little conversations with her about we wanted to do in Seattle and she gave us great tips and helped plan our days. We even had freshly baked brownies when we arrived after a hard day of rainy driving! We felt completely comfortable in the quite large room, which is very private. The bed is really comfortable too! There are some great places to eat and drink nearby - check out the guidebook. We'd love to stay again if we come back to Seattle."
25002,11002612,2014-03-17,3344716,Stephanie,"Met with brownies and fresh fruit, the most comfortable bed and linens.  A close walk to so many things.  I would stay here again anytime.  Thank you Amanda."
25002,11148035,2014-03-23,64672,Maura,"This was an *ideal* place from which to base our Seattle adventures! It was spacious, comfortable, and attractive, and we loved the neighborhood - close proximity to lots of shops, restaurants, etc. but still quiet and residential. Amanda was easy to work with and a very welcoming person. I'd come back anytime."
25002,11179257,2014-03-24,12198980,Sheisha,"Great stay! Amanda was really great about communicating with us before we arrived, and while we were there. She also had excellent brownies for us when we got in. Also gave some suggestions for what to do during our stay, which ended up being great (the Ballard Farmer's market) Would definitely stay here again!"
25002,11229541,2014-03-25,10857783,Frederique,"We loved this place, it was very new, clean, well decorated and comfy. We had everything we needed from organic fruits to homemade brownies, filtered water and real coffee. Definitely our kind of place. No doubt, we will come back. Thanks Amanda."
25002,11281998,2014-03-28,12435675,Deborah,"To reiterate what many others have said, the place was exactly as advertised, and Amanda was great about checking in with us before our arrival and during our stay.  The location is a few blocks away from the bus stop, and the ride to downtown Seattle takes about 20-30 minutes.  I would highly recommend Amanda's place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
25002,11380424,2014-03-31,12812766,Hannah,"Amanda is SO lovely and interesting; I had a great stay and would highly recommend her home to anybody traveling to Seattle. The room is exactly as pictured-- clean and comfortable-- and provided everything you could need during your stay: minifridge, space heater, guidebooks, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, brownies, and more. The location is also excellent; a short bus ride or walk away from Fremont and Ballard. Amanda even offered us a ride one day it was raining. The surrounding neighborhood is neat too. The best part is that she's just so easy-going and laid back; I never felt rushed or stressed being there. Next time I'm in Seattle, I know where I'm staying."
25002,11460518,2014-04-03,13620330,Bruce,Amanda was very friendly and the room very clean and well maintained.
25002,11630036,2014-04-09,13358021,Susan,"Amanda's Ballard space is just as described, and a great location for visiting Seattle.  We stayed two nights and loved exploring the neighborhood with it's charming bungalows and restaurants and shops.
We used the bed and the pull out sofa and both were comfortable and the bathroom was very nice.  
Amanda was very friendly and communicative and we even had a chance to chat a bit our second evening, which was lovely.  She left homemade brownies for us upon our arrival, a very welcome!
I would very much recommend Amanda's Ballard space to anyone.

25002,11951107,2014-04-20,6825361,Cynthia,"What a perfect place!  The room is bigger than it looks in the pictures; Essentially, it a small (well-equipped, well-appointed) apartment.  The bed is extremely comfy - I would have stayed there all day but Seattle is right outside! 
 
Amanda is fab!  I was lucky enough to spend some time with her as I had many questions about teaching in the area, which is what she does and I am hoping to do.

I also got to spend some time with Manzo and Tuti :)))"
25002,12187992,2014-04-25,13936976,Mary,"My husband and I stayed at Amanda's cozy studio for three nights in April, 2014.  Amanda was a wonderful host and the space was perfect for us.  Everything we needed was provided for in the studio, and Amanda was kind enough to leave us some home-baked brownies!  We appreciated the thoughtfulness with which the space is laid out, providing for a place to watch tv, a desk/table, and a cozy bed with fluffy pillows.  There's also plenty of storage to stow what you're not using.  The bathroom has luxe heated floors, too, and it's nice being able to do laundry.  "
25002,12292375,2014-04-28,1359832,Amy,"Charming, spacious, well-equipped and welcoming. Easy access and parking, and amenities like electric kettle, microwave, heated bathroom floor make the place homey and relaxing. Amanda is very easy going and responsive. So lovely, would definitely recommend. "
25002,12488513,2014-05-04,1870126,Ilana,"Great host & apartment! Spacious, clean, safe & lovely neighborhood, close to public transit. A+!"
25002,12588156,2014-05-05,14733375,Jessica,"This place was beautiful! The bed was so comfy and it was in an awesome neighborhood. I suggest the Barking Dog Alehouse nearby. The room had everything and it was so welcoming and cozy. The hostess welcomed us with fantastic brownies and fruit. Also, the room had an amazing tea assortment. :) thank you again!"
25002,12841069,2014-05-12,14296145,Kaycie,"This was a wonderful place to stay on our way to Vancouver and home. We loved the room and the neighborhood. Amanda was really great and left fruit and brownies for us in the room. She also made some really great recommendations for restaurants in the area. Overall, we had a great experience and hope to stay there again the next time we're in Seattle."
25002,12915848,2014-05-14,6808127,Jeanine,"A warm welcome and comfortable stay. The steady wifi and table/desk set up was handy for being online. Will be back for sure!
"
25002,13352607,2014-05-26,3515581,Jillian,We had a lovely time at Amanda's. She was very communicative before and during our stay so we felt right at home. We were lucky with weather and enjoyed relaxing in the backyard.  You can't beat the restaurants on 70th either.
25002,13565692,2014-05-31,2565743,Anna,Amanda was very nice and the room is very comfortable. Nice quiet neighborhood but close to a lot of great locations. I would stay here again! Also her brownies are delicious! Thanks!
25002,13653600,2014-06-02,7028239,Cindy,"The listing was as described. It is a very nicely decorated and comfortable studio with a nice sitting area and mini-kitchen in a very nice neighborhood. Kitchen included micro-wave, refrigerator, and supplies for making coffee or tea. Also the hosts were kind enough to leave milk in the refrigerator, fresh fruit, and a couple of home made brownies. The bed was very comfortable and the towels and bathroom were very nice and the host provided shampoo and cream rinse."
25002,13889086,2014-06-07,15066856,Kitty,"Amanda is very thoughtful and friendly. She made us brownies and there was fruit, milk and all kinds of tea inside the room. It was such a beautiful house and area to stay. We stayed there for 2 nights and we enjoyed it a lot! The bus station is close to our house and also the restaurant nearby is very delicious! We will definitely stay in Amanda's house again when we visit Seattle."
25002,14148597,2014-06-13,12972811,Aimee,"Amanda was very friendly, generous, and accommodating. We arrived after camping and not having laundry service. She arranged her schedule so that we could use the laundry as soon as we arrived. The place was clean and cozy in the perfect neighborhood of Ballard. In addition to the food she provided (fruits, milk, oatmeal), we LOVED the The Fat Hen (breakfast/lunch) and Delancey (dinner), both around the corner. Delancey has some of the best pizza we have ever had! Ballard has a wonderful downtown and there is a bike path that goes right to downtown Seattle from the Ballard Locks. We look forward to our next stay, and would definitely recommend Amanda's place :)    "
25002,14386116,2014-06-18,6808127,Jeanine,Even nicer the second time. Quiet neighborhood. Enjoyed the welcome note with brownies. The heater was on which made the place cozy on a very rainy day when I arrived.
25002,14487805,2014-06-20,490721,Jennifer,Great place to stay. Loved the neighborhood and Amanda was very friendly.  I would definitely stay here again!
25002,14570051,2014-06-22,1001823,Steve & Nancy,Great experience!  This was our first airbnb stay and we really enjoyed the space and our host.  
25002,14742920,2014-06-25,15577124,Marti,"Amanda's cute apartment was perfect for our one night stay.  She supplied us with delicious brownies, a comfortable bed, and coffee for the next morning.  The neighborhood is a quiet and convenient area, with plenty of restaurants nearby, but is also a quick drive to historic Ballard Avenue if other options are needed.  Overall, the apartment was cozy and affordable, and we would stay there again!"
25002,14905195,2014-06-29,11231946,Bob,"This was a great apartment to stay at. It was comfortable and very private. It has a large bathroom and bedroom. The neighborhood is quiet, but it does offer several very good restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay!"
25002,15210024,2014-07-05,12848175,Chris,"The residence was a perfect fit for our needs, and the price was right. The neighborhood is quiet and near a few fine eateries and coffee shops. It is quite a walk or a bus ride to the heart of the Ballard District, but this is not a drawback. The moderate distance is very manageable and lends to the peaceful setting of Amanda's home. 

The accommodations were clean, well-stocked, very pleasant and just the right fit for two travelers. Amanda was a gracious and generous hostess. She didn't interfere with our stay, but she was available and helpful anytime we needed assistance. We found her to be genuinely friendly and considerate. We would definitely consider staying at her place again."
25002,15387819,2014-07-08,5863962,John,"Comfortable, private and spotless accommodation, ideally located in a leafy residential area well served with some superb local restaurants.  We spent 3 days in her apartment with our two daughters and Amanda couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming and was full of advice regarding places to go etc. This was precisely the kind of experience which makes  us choose AirBnB for our holiday accommodation."
25002,15535204,2014-07-11,15816749,Claire,"We loved staying at Amanda's airbnb! Check in was simple, time was flexible, very nice. The space is exactly what it looks like in the photos-- very comfortable, clean, updated. Private entrance. It is in a residential neighborhood that seems  very friendly and inviting. We did not have our own car while we were in town and did just fine between walking and taking the bus. We were in town seeing friends who did have a car so that was helpful at times. If I was here alone, I probably would have rented a car. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! This was our first stay at an airbnb and Amanda has set the bar very high! "
25002,15956135,2014-07-19,738938,Chris,"Super clean and in a quiet residential location, I strongly recommend Amanda's place. Amanda is incredibly nice and helpful, too. Would definitely stay here again. "
25002,16293064,2014-07-25,14862377,David,"We were greater by Amanda when we pulled up.  She gave us an introduction to her rental unit.  She also left a plate of brownies for us.  After being on the road for 4 days it was nice to have a place where we could unpack and relax.  The unit is well thought out, quite roomy,  and had everything we needed, including a boiling pot for water and some organic coffee which was delicious.  There was lots of storage and the bathroom even had a heated floor.  Included was a TV with the  Direct TV system.  We felt right at home and would definitely stay again.  "
25002,16359357,2014-07-26,17371123,Bekkah,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was excellent -- very clean, tidy, comfortable, quiet, and friendly.  I would highly recommend this location, especially if you want to be in Ballard!"
25002,16764049,2014-08-02,415745,Robin,"Amanda was a great host. There were home baked brownies when we arrived and the place was spotless.  We enjoyed eating breakfast on her back deck.  The neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  Parking was always easy.  There were three of us and it was a bit tight, but it worked.  The queen bed was very comfortable. There's a small refridgerater and a microwave.  Any dishes you use need to be washed in the bathroom sink, so eating anything other than breakfast or finger food isn't the best.  But Seattle has so many great restaurants, who wants to eat in, anyway?  I would definitely recommend!"
25002,16900274,2014-08-04,1715690,Kathryn,"Amanda was so welcoming and she seems to have gone out of her way to make sure her guests are comfortable- fruit, coffee, brownies(!), a water filtration pitcher, fresh-cut flowers, etc.. The room was not an ""after thought""- loved the quality mattress and renovated bathroom. This was a great deal on a quiet street and we would definitely return.  Thanks, Amanda!"
25002,17141290,2014-08-08,8998092,Grace,"This is an excellent place to stay.The  spacious apartment is nicely decorated with  loads of storage space, renovated bathroom, desk,and coffee/tea set- up and microwave.  The  fridge was equipped with milk, butter, margarine, and jam in it!!! As others have said...homemade brownies...fresh fruit and flowers help you feel that you are welcome. Very private,quiet and nice neighborhood near busses and restaurants. A definite recommendation. "
25002,17336551,2014-08-11,5605852,Cassie,"Can't say enough great things about this adorable room walking distance to some great spots in Ballard like the Fat Hen and Delancey.  Room and bathroom were moden and spacious and had everything we needed for a great stay, our host even left delcious brownies as a welcoming treat :) Transportation to and from downtown on the Rapid Transit was easy and affordable.  "
25002,17820218,2014-08-18,14613620,Vickie,"Amanda's space was very welcoming, convenient and clean. She and her daughter let us have our space while making sure everything in the apartment was ready for us. I would definitely recommend staying here. If you rent a car, there is plenty of parking and if you care to walk, the location is optimal. "
25002,17955285,2014-08-19,10089095,Chenlu,Very cozy & private stay here. Thank you so much for the brownies:)!!!
25002,18061577,2014-08-21,16399538,Laurie,"Amanda was there to greet my cousin as she arrived, and made her feel right at home. There was fruit and brownies that Amanda had made, and a personal note from her.  I didn't arrive until much later with my son, but Amanda had come downstairs the next day, and we finally met. 
She has a nice set-up in the room we were in, and both her front and backyards had beautiful flowers.
 She graciously allowed my son to use a bike and helmet for some 'exploring', and we were also able to use the backyard for 'private time'. 
The beds were quite comfortable, plus we had access to more linens, bed sheets, and a nice washer/dryer were also available. 
The bathroom was very roomy, with nice lighting.
All in all, it was a very comfy stay, Amanda is a super host, and we were very happy with our accommodations.  "
25002,18389913,2014-08-25,19801958,Brandon,"Amanda was super nice! She greatest my wife and I with brownies upon arrival. The place was just as advertised. The apartment was easy to find, clean as a whistle, and parking was not a problem at all.  "
25002,18882071,2014-09-02,7774733,Megan,"My boyfriend and I traveled to Portland and Seattle over labor day weekend and we sure did pick the best places to stay! We were greeted with brownies in the fridge, a variety of teas, and a nice welcome note. We did not have a lot of time in Seattle but we made the most of it, and the location of Amanda's place was great. We would definitely stay there again!"
25002,18998408,2014-09-04,19874631,Bang,Fantastic! Amanda was really friendly and easy to coordinate and communicate with.  Thanks for the wonderful stay!  The place looks exactly like the picture.
25002,19076157,2014-09-06,18099766,Bethan,This was our first airbnb experience and our first stop on a road trip. Amanda's place was lovely and very private. Amanda had left some delicious brownies and we felt very welcome. We would happily stay here again. Thanks!
25002,19351305,2014-09-10,7810317,Michael,Comfortable stay for one night. Amanda devoted a lot of thought to making our stay comfortable which was evident from check in to check out. 
25002,19614210,2014-09-15,2790955,Lindsay,"Easy stay, nice quiet neighborhood but very close to Ballard restaurant area which we loved! We parked right in the driveway which was appreciated. Easy to communicate with host, great stay! "
25002,19783069,2014-09-18,20165131,Amber,"We absolutely loved our stay in Seattle. Totally fell in love with the city and Amanda's unit could not have been more perfect. Clean, comfy, and close enough to shops and restaurants ... But also tucked away in a nice residential area that made us feel like we were getting a taste of real Seattle. Ballard and Phinney Ridge are super charming. 

The unit itself is well stocked with toiletries and towels, coffee, a mini-fridge, books and magazines ... Everything you need. And the brownies that were waiting on us were delicious! Would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it highly."
25002,19818194,2014-09-19,8553344,Rebecca,"

Amanda was awesome. My girlfriend & I arrived very late our first night due to flight delays, but sure enough, brownies and a warmly lit front door/driveway beckoned us into our own quarters in her Amanda's home. She included a welcome letter as well. We had everything we needed throughout our 4-night stay, and the location is prime for getting easily to/from many of Seattle's famous tourist attractions and its thriving Downtown area. Ballard was extremely charming and turned out to be our favorite neighborhood of those we experienced during our stay. Thank you so much, Amanda! "
25002,19973187,2014-09-21,15541144,Stacy,We booked the wrong date but Amanda was really kind about it and offered us to stay the following weekend if she had not already booked guests.

Although my schedule kept me from meeting Amanda, she was so helpful and checked in on me via email to make sure my trip was going well. I would recommend her and this spot to anyone. "

We had complete independence and privacy, and the neighborhood was lovely, quiet. We arrived to a plate of the most delicious brownies I've had in my life, and a warm welcome note. The room would have comfortably slept 4, was very clean, and was cozy as well. Great vibes :) Great spot :)"
25002,20972395,2014-10-08,5952256,Thomas,"Amanda greeted us as we arrived, and my wife and I immediately felt at home. The spacious basement apartment had easy access to the street and a beautiful gardened backyard, and freshly baked brownies were ready for us when we unlocked our door. Everything was very tidy. "
25002,21011377,2014-10-09,17176079,Chris,"Amanda was well prepared for our overnight stay. She greeted my wife and I with homemade brownies and a smile. The accommodations were even better than described. The free WiFi was very handy. Her advice as a local resident spared us a good hour's worth of local traffic and we enjoyed a delicious breakfast  at a placed she recommended.

The size of the place was big enough for us, and street parking was abundant. Amanda herself was welcoming and helpful when we asked for suggestions to getting around the city. We would definitely stay here again! "

Everything fully operable, really no issues at all.  Bed had clean sheets, the mattress was very comfortable.  Pillow choices were good.  Brownies on arrival were great after a long trip.  The fruit basket was helpful for a quick morning snack as well.  We traveled to and from the apartment both by bus and using Uber.  Bus stops are nearby, and Uber easily found the apartment.  If I were to return to Seattle, this would be my first choice."

The room is as advertised, with two closets and copious storage space, and the chocolate, fruit, milk, coffee and tea available  began our mornings wonderfully! The bathroom was well ventilated (the heated floor perfect for our December stay!), and included plentiful toiletries. We look forward to staying again!"

25002,25495576,2015-01-18,8116019,Regina,"Amanda was an excellent host! We had a late flight in and got to Ballard close to 10pm. The room was warmed up and there were brownies waiting for us. It was such a sweet touch. She even left out a basket of toys for my 18 month old. The neighborhood is beautiful and the public transportation is really easy. My wife, son, and I stayed for 5 days and had no problem getting all over Ballard and into downtown Seattle just by bus. The room was the perfect size for us and having access to a washer and drier made a big difference, especially when we had been out in the rain. This was our first time using Arirbnb and we'll definitely be doing it again. Amanda's place is on the top of our list for places to stay next time we come to Seattle and I'd highly recommend it to anybody else. "

There was food to greet us when we arrived, and we were tickled to find that everything we needed, and more, was there.  Amanda had everything a hotel would—soap, shampoo, hairdryer, etc., but also a number of other toiletries you might need, from toothpaste to hair gel.  In addition to the fridge and microwave, a Brita pitcher was waiting with water, and a selection of teas was available.  The place was warm, even in the middle of winter, and it sits in the middle of a fantastic Seattle neighborhood.  Amanda was friendly, easy-going, and available with plenty of suggestions for exploring the area.  We hope to be able to visit again!"

I loved the brownies she had made for us and even had milk in the fridge to go with it. The space was spacious and it was everything you needed for a weekend getaway. I would definitely be staying here if I make another trip out to Seattle. 
25002,26853556,2015-02-20,9484311,Keegan,"I saw reviews that said ""stop looking, book now."" That's solid advice.

Amanda is a dream to communicate with -- helpful, and gives great clear instructions. Because of our arrival and departure times we weren't able to meet, but it definitely felt like we had our autonomy while also being warmly welcomed. Pretty incredible. Superhost indeed!

The room was spotlessly clean and so cozy and nice. Parking was so easy. The neighborhood has nice places in walking distance but is quiet and peaceful at night.

All in all, I highly suggest that you book this place!"
25002,26900148,2015-02-21,10455702,Esther,Our stay at Amanda's was great! Everything was clean and cozy. The space was large and comfortable enough for our family of 4 adults and 1 baby. Amanda was gracious to let us make a last minute reservation.

25002,27753640,2015-03-10,20496336,Emiko,"Amanda's space is very cozy in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. I loved that there was coffee and tea that could easily be prepared, and organic milk provided in the mini fridge. Amanda was very accommodating of our last minute plans and got back to me quickly. The room is a converted garage under the main house, so we were a little hesitant of our noise level. It wasn't anything that disrupted our stay though. I would recommend it!"
25002,27825500,2015-03-12,17054066,Mark,"This host was very nice and quick to respond, locations was very convenient for everything and you don't have to worry about parking! The room was very clean and accommodating. "

advertised."
25002,28332616,2015-03-22,8848624,Tiffany,"Upon arriving at Amanda's space, we were greeted with pistachios and organic strawberries.  Both snacks were appreciated following a long drive to Seattle.

The hospitality didn't end there!  The space was warm and welcoming (so was the bathroom floor - which was heated!!!!).  The pictures accurately reflect the coziness of the room.

Although we didn't meet Amanda directly, she made sure that we knew she was available if needed.

I would highly recommend a stay with Amanda.  Thank you!!!"

25002,28857701,2015-03-30,7745037,Brielyn,"Amanda's place in Ballard was exactly as described—lovely, quiet, and peaceful. There were brownies and fresh fruit waiting for me when I arrived, and I especially enjoyed being able to make a cup of tea with the electric kettle.  

The location is perfect for a run to the Ballard Locks and a walk to Market Street. As a former Seattleite, I have to say that this location felt like being back at home! Staying here will give you a good sense of what it's like to live in an iconic Seattle neighborhood. There are beautiful gardens (including Amanda's), and it's walking/running distance to the Ballard Locks and Market Street. I highly recommend staying at Amanda's home! "

She had tea, water, and fresh fruit waiting for us, as well as brownies and wifi. The room and the bathroom are neat and very clean. There were towels and soap there too. The bed and the sofa were very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet at night and filled with people walking their dogs and kids going to school in the day. Just a 10-15 minute walk from some amazing restaurants such as Delancy and Essex and The Fat Hen. I would 100% recommend staying here. What a gem! Amanda was very responsive to all of our inquiries and responded very quickly to our initial request to book. She's a great host. "

Getting into the space was no problem at all and there was plenty of parking (which is sometimes difficult to find in Seattle). She also made some restaurant recommendations for us since we'd be getting into town for a late dinner. The space is super cute and completely private from the upstairs where she lives. It had everything we needed. Our only regret was we were not able to spend more than a single night there. "
25002,30849804,2015-04-27,8717555,Mary,"Amanda was friendly and available if I needed anything.

The apartment was clean and well-outfitted and it's located on a lovely, quiet street in Ballard, but it's a short walk to several bars/restaurants (definitely check out Essex!) and only a 20-minute walk to everything on Market Street. I'd highly recommend it. "

We stayed for 2, non-consecutive nights and check-in was easy both times.  Delicious brownies and fruit were waiting for us upon arrival. Amanda gave us a great recommendation for dinner, which was easily the best meal we ate throughout our entire 10 day trip. I loved the Ballard neighborhood and hope that I'll be able to return, explore a bit more, and stay at Amanda's again."

Amanda is a very thoughtful and generous host who understands the unique needs of travelers with kids (we have a 5-yr-old); she has thought of everything! We spent most of our time each day visiting with family (and thus could not make full use of all the facilities she offered), but it was a relief having this apartment as a base. We are thankful for Amanda's hospitality and would love to stay at the apartment whenever we visit Seattle next."

It's located in a very peaceful neighbourhood in close proximity of downtown Ballard, which has a lot of nice restaurants, cute shops and a wonderful movie theatre.
The absolute best thing about our trip were our hosts Amanda, her daughter Luisa and the two cats. Their door was always open, they had some great advice on where to go and what to see and Amanda was so kind to show us a few things herself.  We left with a very warm feeling and two friends richer.
We highly recommend Amanda's to everybody and hope to see them again one day!"
25002,39368192,2015-07-23,24129111,Sangbum,"I, my wife, and two kids stayed at Amanda's guest house for 2nights. The room was big enough to stay for my family. The sofa bed was just like a normal double bed. Although the bathroom was separated from the room, we could use it as our private bathroom because it was just across the corridor and we were the only one who use it. In the second evening of our stay, we met the host, Amanda and we had a talk about Seattle and my country, South Korea. It was so fun and she was very nice. We could make a good memory in Seattle thanks to Amanda. :)"
25002,39654452,2015-07-25,22572580,Muzi,Sweet little room in a nice community. Great restaurants nearby.  The host was communicative and helpful. 
25002,40125012,2015-07-28,36643438,Aksana,"What a treat! We felt right at home the whole time. It's the little things that make all the difference and Amanda got em all right, from the brownies to the bathroom amenities. The studio was warm and cozy and Ballard (neighborhood) offered plenty of 'off the beaten path' options if you're looking to get away from the downtown area. We'd be lucky to stay here again if we're back in Seattle."
25002,40299160,2015-07-29,39622508,Pierre,Great experience with Amanda! She was very warm and welcoming and helped us plan our trip. She even gave us an old cooler! The room was very clean and came with yummy brownies and some fruit. Thanks again!
25002,40359131,2015-07-30,524822,Stian,"Amanda was so great!
She was super available and helpful.
We had a famous day in Seattle, thanks to her :)
Highly recommend this rental to all visitors.
Loved the neighborhood as well."
25002,41055941,2015-08-04,25893967,Susan,We really enjoyed our time at Amanda's! Nice amenities and very welcoming. Great neighborhood and close to everything. We also loved that the room stayed cool during a very warm week in Seattle. We highly recommend Amanda's place and have already suggested it to another friend that may need future accommodations in Ballard.
25002,41240171,2015-08-05,404068,Erin,"Amanda was a very considerate host.  She was easy to communicate with, and kindly gave us a heads up a Block Party happening on her block, which would have impacted our parking.  But, with her information we were able to arrive early enough to even enjoy the party.  Amanda was fabulous with our twin toddlers, bringing out toys for them to play with and entertaining them a bit while we unpacked the car.  The apartment was lovely, pretty colors, and nice things.  We look forward to returning some day.  Thanks for the hospitality, beautiful home, and sweet neighborhood.  The neighborhood rocked!! Great little shops, parks, restaurants all within walking distance."
25002,42107497,2015-08-11,15083157,Emily,"The stay was wonderful! The bed was comfy, and the set up was awesome. It was nice to be able to stay in a neighborhood instead of a hotel. Amanda was amazing! She was there if I had any questions about Seattle and checked in to make sure the stay was going well. She left yummy brownies for when we arrived! I would definitely stay here again! "
25002,42378849,2015-08-13,4452257,Arnie,"Finding an affordable place to stay in Seattle is tough. This really fit the bill. Very quiet at night and nice Private space. Amanda was very helpful, even baked brownies for us. We took the Rapid Ride bus right into downtown. Took about 40 minutes, but was an easy trip. Room and bathroom were very clean. Found good places to run and eat in Ballard."
25002,42813939,2015-08-16,5285222,David,"Amanda was in holidays but left us indications and excellent brownies and plums from the backyard! The room is set in a formerly garage but there is space, no moisture and it is well equiped. Just some dust here and there. 
Two near bus lines can reach downtown Seattle in 30 minutes. Good location. "
25002,44439093,2015-08-26,26446899,Mary,"Everything was described. Amanda was awesome! Even though she was on a trip herself, she managed to get everything set up and ready for our arrival, including welcome brownies! She also has great suggestions for anything you would want to eat or see. Parking was pretty easy to find on the street, if not, there's a parking spot in from of the house that we could use. I would definitely stay at her home again."
25002,44634008,2015-08-28,6020866,Sylvain,"We had a great time at Amanda's Studio in Seattle, comfortable with nice , up and coming neighborhoods. There is some cool cafes and restaurants not so far from her place, Amanda gave us some cool addresses in the area. Everything went smoothly , she's been so helpful.
I absolutely recommend her place.

Le studio est tout à fait confortable, bien situé dans un quartier bien sympathique  Amanda est une personne super gentille et accueillante, 
Nous avons ainsi passé un agréable, court séjour à Seattle. 

シンプルで、快適なAmandaさんのワンルームアパートは、シアトルの静かな住宅街にあり、周辺にはトレンディーなカフェやレストランが幾つか点在してして、沢山の発見がありました。ホストのアマンダさんは、外国人に英語を教えている先生なので、英語圏以外の方以外でもすぐに打ち解けることができます。滞在中には大変親切にしていただきました！オススメの貸しアパートです。"
25002,44784599,2015-08-29,20530425,Luke,"We all loved staying with Amanda! The apartment is clean, spacious and includes all amenities you could ever need - tea, coffee, cutlery, laundry.

Amanda was incredibly knowledgable about her area and even gave us a little tour around the Ballard neighbourhood which was incredibly sweet of her.

Finally, the freshly baked brownies on arrival were a lovely little treat :)!"
25002,45239169,2015-09-01,7105835,Ophélie & Sébastien,"Logement spacieux, propre, amanda vous accueille chaleureusement avec des gâteaux maison délicieux. Accessibilité du centre de seattle rapide, il faut prendre un bus a 5 minutes. "
25002,45579323,2015-09-04,27319907,Linda,"   Amanda replied to my emails promptly and concisely. She gave excellent directions on how to reach her apartment via the light rail from the airport, taking the Rapid D bus to 70th Street, then walking the short distance to her house, finding the key as she had described. We were greeted with a plate of brownies and a bowl of apples upon our arrival.
   The apartment could not have been more comfy and welcoming, making us feel right at home. The bed was a comfortable queen, and the small sofa with lots of pillows faced a flat screen TV with Directv. There was a microwave with teas and instant cereals. Amanda had thought of everything from ace bandages for sore feet to hair mouse for those who hate to pay the airline baggage fee and travel light. Lamps were on each side of the bed-most welcome for those of us who like to read at night. The linens, towels, and bath products were luxurious. Everything was neat and clean. We did not use the backyard, but she had a nice space with lots of flowers, some of which she had placed in small vases within the apartment.
   Walking a couple blocks down the street was Delaney's Pizza. The pizza was good, but the salads looked really good. Wish I had had the salad! Breakfast the next morning atThe French Hen (across the  street from Delaney's) was a treat. Make sure to arrive early!
   But what makes this apartment special is Amanda herself. She has such an outgoing, friendly manner that makes you feel like a long, lost friend. After inquiring about her ragdoll cat, Monzo, she brought him downstairs to visit. When she found we were going to the locks, she offered to drive us, taking us on a roundabout tour of Ballard including Golden Gardens Park north of the locks.
   Without a doubt, I would return in a minute and recommend her apartment to others. Ballard has an old-town feel, it is quieter than downtown Seattle, there are many restaurants and interesting shops, and it is a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. Thank you, Amanda, for such a wonderful experience!"
25002,46263820,2015-09-09,30951021,Cindy,"Amanda is a very very nice host, we all like her, her house also very comfertable, we enjoy our days in Seattle.
It's a good choice to stay in Amanda's
house."
25002,46578566,2015-09-12,33439046,Brittney,Amanda was so hospitable from first communication! The room was lovely. Very comfortable and clean. This was our first time using Airbnb and Amanda made it a wonderful stay! 
25002,46693626,2015-09-13,28259161,Yasumasa,"Amanda's place was really lovely, comfortable.
Also quite convenient place,not so far from dawn town Seattle. If I have a chance to go there, I'll be stay there again 100%."
25002,47147810,2015-09-16,3222982,Julie,"Amanda's unit was very cute and comfortable, and in a great location! Amanda was really helpful, and she left some amazing brownies for us, as well as fresh fruit on arrival. She provided all the toiletries etc you would need if you'd forgotten anything - very thoughtful. Thanks heaps Amanda !"
25002,47263531,2015-09-17,5628015,Genevieve,"Amanda's place was great! The neighborhood was lovely and so well situated. We were very comfortable here and wished we could stay longer. She recommended some great restaurants and had a very friendly cat to boot.
"
25002,47628267,2015-09-21,4642487,Benjamin,"I've stayed at AirBnB's across the country and Amanda's place in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood has been my favorite by far. Great, quiet neighborhood walkable to some awesome restaurants. Nice room and bathroom (which also has heated floors!), comfortable couch, and clean furnishings throughout. Amanda left us brownies and fruit, too, which was the cherry on top. Highly recommended."
25002,49201789,2015-10-02,29786705,Janet,We have just stayed at Amanda's flat for 10 days. Amanda was wonderful host who provided lots of extra special touches like fresh fruit/flowers and a lovely welcome gift of home made brownies. The flat was just perfect and felt like 'home from home '. I would highly recommend staying at this lovely flat if your are planning a trip to wonderful Ballard. We certainly will be! 
25002,49885609,2015-10-07,31745187,Elaine,"Perfect apartment- comfortable furnishings and well laid out. 
Amanda made the whole process very simple & had lots of Seattle information available to make decisions on what to see & do during my visit very simple. 
The welcome Chocolate Brownies were fabulous- should have asked for the recipe. 
Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to others. "
25002,50005515,2015-10-08,36486998,Enoch,Amanda was a great host. Her room provides all the necessary amenities and comfort. She is a warm and welcoming person and provided a great environment to rest after checking out the sitting
25002,50466478,2015-10-12,31730272,Aimee,"Amanda was a wonderful host and the room was great with lots of nice little touches like fresh, homemade brownies on arrival. Easy to get the rapid ride bus to downtown Seattle for only $2.50. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again :)"
25002,50733115,2015-10-13,27529583,Nora,"Amanda was a great host! She was very accommodating of my desire to check in a little early and do some laundry. The room is clean and cozy and has lots of nice touches from all the toiletries I needed in the bathroom to a variety of teas and brownies when I arrived! The house is also well located, walking distance to lots of good coffee and food, and a short drive or bus to other great Seattle spots. "
25002,51012656,2015-10-17,32749662,LeAnn,"Amanda was a wonderful host! A delicious plate of brownies greeted us upon arrival and the space was very comfortable, perfect for my husband, 6 month old son and myself. 

Private entrance, plenty of closet space for our things, fruit, granola bars, oatmeal,  coffee & tea were all available and very much appreciated. We had a lovely stay!"
25002,51324147,2015-10-19,4123684,Theodore,"Amanda's place was perfectly situated and had everything we needed and more. She even baked us some brownies! There is a fridge, hot water for tea, and felt like a bonafide hotel but with the comfort of a home. A great and comfortable space, I highly recommend her place for any trip you have in Seattle!"
25002,51571403,2015-10-21,1802829,Paul & Alysa,"The PERFECT place to rest your head when visiting Ballard and beyond. Steps away from the bus, and so cozy and private. Amanda was the best host, going way above and beyond expectations even allowing us to stay an extra night in her daughter's room because of a travel snafu. We LOVED it! 

"
25002,52054677,2015-10-26,5883104,Suzanne,Amanda is an amazing host! Her home was perfect for our stay in the Ballard area. Hospitality is definitely one of Amanda's gifts as we arrived to wonderful brownies as well as breakfast food being provided! She even made bath toys available for our 10 month old son! Thank you so much! We would recommend you and your place to anyone! 
25002,52411014,2015-10-29,12911100,Alex,"Staying in this apartment was ideal. Amanda provides an incredibly comfortable, clean, warm, and inviting space. This place has lots of privacy, no hassle getting in and out, and is in a great neighborhood. She thinks of all the little details so you're taken care of. 

Ballard is awesome, and still has a mix of trendy places you have to wait in line for -and- unassuming local favorites that have been around forever. This apartment is a little outside of all that, nestled amongst cute old houses. There's a cluster of great places just a few blocks away, and then even more to the North and South. An easy 30-minute walk gets you to heart of Ballard, or you can drive and park with relative ease.

Seriously, this is absolutely my new home base for any Seattle visits in the future!"
25002,53247729,2015-11-07,22085067,Joaliné,"The place is awesome, really comfortable and greatly equipped. Amanda left brownies, fruits and things in the fridge, so it was also very welcoming the moment we got in. The neighborhood is also super nice. I can only say it is the place to stay when visiting Seattle, close to a lot of places for eating and for walking. Amanda was also approachable and always friendly. Would deffinitely recommend this place to anyone. Also, that bed is magical, you can sleep for fourteen hours or more and still not want to get up."
25002,53674284,2015-11-11,37834617,Krysteena,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was amazing! The place is clean, comfortable and easily accessible. There is a separate entrance and bathroom, so you do not have to worry about disturbing anyone.

This place is very spacious. There is a mini fridge and various snacks that Amanda provides (including some homemade brownies!). There is also a microwave and water heater available for use as well. 

The bed is very comfortable and warm (which is good because it got a bit chilly due to the fall weather). There is also a pull out sofa bed and a desk that can seat two people. If you need, there is a washer/dryer that Amanda lets you use, which I found very convenient because I was traveling from another city and I only brought enough clothes to fit in my carry-on. 

One of the best things about this place was that it was easy to find. There are lights that outline the doorway, so that it is easy to figure out which house to pull up to in the neighborhood. 

Another great thing about this place was there was a lot of places that were within walking distance (~20 minute walks, which isn't too far in my opinion). I didn't rent a car while I was out there, so being able to walk around the neighborhood and find a good coffee shop was great. 

Amanda was a fantastic host! She was friendly and flexible with my schedule (I had a late flight coming in to Seattle and my cousin decided to join me last minute). Plus, she had some great recommendations for me as this was my first time in Seattle. 

This will be my go-to place whenever I visit Seattle!! "
25002,54301200,2015-11-17,1963808,Hilary,"Amanda was able to accommodate us (and our bikes!) for a one-night stay on fairly short notice. The house and guest entrance were easy to find, and the space was as expected/listed. Really appreciated all the little touches (lots of backup toiletries in the bathroom, snacks in the suite, etc) that made our brief stay easier. Had a short and pleasant chat with Amanda shortly after we got in, and I think we would have enjoyed settling into the suite/exploring more of the neighbourhood had our trip been longer. Thanks again, Amanda!"
25002,54406982,2015-11-19,48709015,Kimberly,Staying at your place was great! Very clean and cozy and welcoming. Thank you so much! 
25002,54849725,2015-11-25,6415166,Ashley,"Amanda was a great host and her place was great. My parents stayed here, and they loved the brownies, fresh fruit, and heated tile floors in the bathroom! They said it was quiet and comfortable. "
25002,55381789,2015-12-01,13712337,Linda,"This is a lovely, comfortable room with everything you could want for a wonderful stay including a heated bathroom floor - it felt so elegantly decadent!  You can make freshly ground coffee at your leisure in the morning and chill your wine in the little fridge for the evening.  The delicious warm brownies waiting when we arrived late in the evening and the Sunday New York Times awaiting our return from breakfast later in our visit made us feel very cared for.  So many little kind details but the best was our warm friendly hostess Amanda.  We definitely hope to have an occasion to visit again."
25002,55592924,2015-12-02,49841013,Brenda,"Our stay at Amanda's was exactly what we wanted. Cozy, warm, comfortable, and safe feeling away from home. We came in late due to unforeseen events, and Amanda made it easy to just come on in and settle in after a long drive. The room is in the middle of a cute neighborhood, easy walking distance to Delancey pizza-which was sooo good :) and other little neighborhood stores. Easy drive to downtown. There are heated floors in the restroom, made such a difference in the cold weather. Thanks for everything, it was great!"
25002,56597479,2015-12-15,44877196,Patricia,"We had a lovely stay at Amanda's home. It was easy to find the location, and she greeted us after we arrived. And when Is say ""greeted"" I mean ""said hello and provided yummy brownies""! 

The room was quite comfortable, and I appreciated the provided tea and coffee. The bedroom and bathroom we quite clean. We experienced no noise issues, and the bed was quite comfortable.

The home is in a great location — walking distance from wonderful places to eat and we enjoyed three of those locations! I only wish we had stayed longer so we could visit a few more. 

Many thanks to Amanda for making our stay so very pleasant."
25002,56990615,2015-12-20,43352097,Karla,"I just returned home from 4 days in Seattle.  We had a wonderful stay at Amanda's!  It is a quiet neighborhood, easy to find, and Amanda left us with directions of what to do if she wasn't home when we arrived.  Also, correspondence with Amanda was always quick and responsive.  The room has a small fridge, microwave, and is stocked with  assorted teas and light breakfast offerings of fresh fruit and granola bars.  Such a nice touch.  Best of all we were welcomed with fresh brownies when we arrived!  I'm looking forward to our next stay,  that is already booked, at Amanda's in February!"
25002,57105351,2015-12-21,45544396,Katie,"This place was a true gem! Amanda made us feel so welcome by leaving us a nice note wishing me a happy birthday and a plate with 2 tasty brownies! She greeted us upon arrival, made sure we had everything we needed, and told us to enjoy ourselves. The bed was comfy and the heated tiles in the bathroom were amazing! The Ballard area was very quaint and the short drive to downtown was easy. We will absolutely stay with Amanda again on our next trip to Seattle!"
25002,57272432,2015-12-23,16929997,Shelby,Amanda was a great host! Her apartment was centrally located to many area shops. The description of her apartment was right on. My husband and I enjoyed our trip. We would definitely recommend her to anyone. Thank you for being so accommodating.

2865992,14310796,2014-06-16,16252580,Kris,Mike was an extremely gracious host. Mike and his wife were so friendly and accommodating to me as I made the move to Seattle and was looking for my own place to live. Check-in and check-out were super easy. The room was just what I needed and was as advertised. And what a view from the room! It was great waking up to that every morning. 
2865992,14998252,2014-06-30,16688934,Hannah,"We had a marvellous experience living in this beautiful house.

2865992,16213242,2014-07-23,7488141,Reinhold,"Mike and Lynn are very welcoming and accommodating hosts. We stayed for a week while visiting our grandson and his parents. The unit is almost like a studio unit, very private, peaceful and quiet with great views of the sound.  Would have loved to be more physically able to walk the hills of the neighborhood. With a car, everything you could want or need is close by.  Our grandson even spent a night with us in the room. Looking forward to a return trip to Lynn and Mike's lovely home. "
2865992,16321766,2014-07-25,13435248,Patrick,"Entre l'aéroport et Seattle, la maison de Mike est située dans un havre de verdure, avec une vue magnifique sur l'océan et une tranquillité exeptionnelle. La chambre est plus que spacieuse et le confort y est total. Mike nous a donné d'excellents conseils que nous avons mis à profit pour la suite de notre voyage.  A recommander sans réserve."
2865992,16591119,2014-07-29,10955646,Michael,"We could not have been happier with the 'reception' Mike Wald and his wife extended to us.  They were gracious and accommodating despite our early arrival.  They extended an invitation ""To call, If they could in any way add to the comfort of our stay."".. and then left us in peace to enjoy the well appointed and very clean  ""Room With a View"". 
We booked the room because of it's close proximity to a wedding we were attending the following day, and due to the quiet, flowered, pleasurable setting, it seemed we were on a bit of a 'honeymoon' ourselves!
 The view, ah.. 'The View"".  The rugged spine of the Olympic Range dominated in modest repose on the distant horizon, alluring with adventurous form.  From our perch, just below the highest point in Seattle ( as we were  informed by our host), our gaze fell upon the great stretch of sea which lay between us and those high dramatic peaks.
 The stoic ferry boats plowed away on that vast plain of blue water, creasing it with fleeting wakes in their persistent business between the dark fir and hemlock shrouded islands and the majestic architecture of Seattle.  Our eyes followed there movements to the distant harbors and anchored our pleasure in the voyage. 
Please forgive. I rapt too poetic...but such was our most agreeable interlude in this 'Room With a View'. It would be ingenuous to do otherwise.

Mike & Lynn had thought of every possible comfort.There were lots of suggestions and help for getting around, things to see&do We especially appreciated a local map with the best coffee and eateries marked - oh that Greek food! 
The location was great for us - a little out of the city, quiet and beautiful views over the waterways and islands of Seattle,surrounded by well loved and cared for garden-just like the photos
thank you both Mike and Lynn for making our weekend so enjoyable,we hope to do the same for you if you ever come to Sydney!

It was private, quiet and fantastic views. Close proximity to the bus also which was very helpful, as they did not rent a car. One of my friends is very tall and found the bed most comfortable.  Host Mike and his wife Lynn were a pleasure to meet and so relaxing to be around. I will definitely consider this space again if needed!!"
2865992,17464314,2014-08-12,18484143,Natalie,We had a lovely time at Mike and Lynne's beautiful home. The check in and out process was very easy for us newbies!

The room is very clean,spacious and airy.  We loved the location too. It's in a residential area so it was quiet and secluded but a short car drive later you were in downtown Seattle taking in the sights.  We'll gladly return to Mike and Lynn's home at the next opportunity."

Upon arrival, their neighbor and her very sweet dog Andrew let me in to my suite and made me feel welcome.  Later that evening when Mike and Lynne came home they brought me beautiful flowers for my room!!  As someone who travels for work, it was so nice to be in a homey, comfortable atmosphere.  The suite is clean and just as advertised.  The view is amazing and the gardens are just beautiful.  Mike helped me to find yoga studios nearby and checked in to be sure I did not need help with directions or things to do several times.  I will definitely look up Mike and Lynne if I head back to Seattle."

They responded so quick that we were able to make the same day booking.  They also gave us some advice that very helpful, especially the seafood place named Seatle Fish Company at California Ave. We ended up eating there twice during our 2 days visit. We will definitely come back here. Hopefully there wont be a line waiting to be check in Mike and Lynn's place :)"
2865992,18257408,2014-08-24,465520,Saundra,"Staying at Mike and Lynn's was a delightful experience.  Comfortable, welcoming, absolutely beautiful.  Everything we could have needed (refrigerator, microwave, comfy seating with good lighting, dining table, hair dryer) was provided.  And best of all, the views of the Sound are spectacular.  Quiet, peaceful, like being in a garden apartment overlooking the sea.  Mike and Lynne were great at communicating with me before and during, guiding us when we asked, and steering us to the best restaurants, the water taxi, and even giving us college tips for my teenage son.   Like staying with long-time friends.  We will be back when we are in Seattle.  Thank you Mike and Lynn."
2865992,18459595,2014-08-26,19868957,Howard,"The view is more stunning than the  picture, even though it doesn't seem possible.The design of the room is clean, simple, and comfortable. Mike and Lynn couldn't be nicer. The only regret I have is that I didn't stay there longer."
2865992,18733861,2014-08-31,18966004,Martin,"Our stay in West Seattle was great. The room didn't miss anything we could possibly desire. Bus stop was within 7 minutes walk and thus the wide City of Seattle was accessible. The hosts were very nice and friendly and helped us with very good recommendations and hints to many things.
They put a lot of effort into the apartment to make it as comfortable as possible."
2865992,19440764,2014-09-12,12319119,Stephen,"I go to Seattle for work. Mike and Lynn were very kind to have waited for me and settled me in at 2:30 A.M., due to my late arrival and complication at the rental car. The listing description is very accurate. The room is big and has everything you need. It's clean and comfortable. The view from the room of the Sound and mountains is amazing. The hosts live on the main floor and the guess room is on the lower level next to the garage. It has its own entrance—very private and convenient. After a day's work, this apartment is a perfect place to relax. "
2865992,19540325,2014-09-14,20183565,Matt,Mike's home is incredible and he and his wife are excellent hosts. My wife and I absolutely plan to stay with them again if we are lucky enough to return to Seattle.
2865992,20377867,2014-09-28,17427872,Traci,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this home.  The view is really beautiful.  The bed was very comfortable.  We had our own entrance and bathroom.  The room was very spacious and stocked with a refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee.  Mike was a very nice and warm host.  We definitely recommend staying here."
2865992,20802078,2014-10-05,2495636,Bob,great quiet neighborhood centrally located to many restaurants and parks.
2865992,21653247,2014-10-21,9717476,Gila,"Mike and Lynne are great hosts and really nice people, they gave us a lot of helpful tips about the Seattle area and west coast in general. We loved the clean and comfortable apartment with a gorgeous view, highly recommended! :)"
2865992,21932627,2014-10-26,9501273,Aaron,"Mike and Lynn were great. They gave us a map, rain jackets, and advice on where to go. The bed was great! The room was so amazingly clean and comfy. I felt like I was staying at a really nice hotel, except with more perks! Coffee, tea, dishes and silverware all readily available, minifridge and microwave. Cable tv. Lots of lights. It was one of the best places we've ever stayed!"
2865992,23706900,2014-12-08,5378565,Gary,"Our stay with Mike and Lynn was the best experience we have had with airbnb.  Our hosts were very hospitable and helpful from the first internet contact through the entire stay.  When we arrived they invited us into their home for a chance to get acquainted and to provide suggestions for places to see and how to travel around the city.  They also gave us maps and a list of their favorite restaurants, which was very helpful. 
After we settled in, they left us alone to enjoy the city, and that's
exactly what we did!  Their house is in a great residential neighborhood
overlooking Puget Sound, and the guest suite is spacious, clean, and
nicely appointed, with a great view of the sound.  We especially
appreciated the private entrance and off-street parking.  The only issue, which was minor, was the room temperature.  The space heater in the suite, which was the only way we could control the temperature, wasn't quite up to the task of keeping the room warm, especially in the evening.  We just bundled up a little and that took care of it.  I'm sure our hosts would have addressed the problem if we had mentioned it to them.  Overall, we had a wonderful time in Seattle, in large part due to the hospitality and
accommodations provided by Mike and Lynn."
2865992,24093133,2014-12-19,20523702,Gabe,"Mike and Lynne are extremely warm and welcoming, and the house is in a beautiful quiet area of Seattle. The room is unbelievably comfortable and has everything I need to feel at home during my business trips. There are so really good restaurants nearby and Mike and Lynne were happy to direct me to some of their favorites. This was my second visit and I hope not my last. "
2865992,30095023,2015-04-17,19506270,Kay,Mike and Lynne were delightful hosts.  The room was SO comfortable and I slept wonderfully.  Lots of privacy and a lovely view.  All I needed for my one business week was provided.  I have already recommended it to friends.  KL
2865992,31821777,2015-05-10,2054611,Kathy,The house is in a pretty and quiet neighborhood and the room is a lovely space with a beautiful view.  Mike gave us a key at a time that was convenient for us and showed us around the space.  It was a very comfortable place to spend a weekend in Seattle.
2865992,33296619,2015-05-26,32568947,Jenna,"The owners were extremely nice and welcoming. They had great advice on the area and my trip and were very accommodating when my plans changed last minute. Their home is beautiful and very comfortable, plus the view is spectacular. While the hills to/from their home were a challenge they were still walkable to Morgan Junction and public transportation. I would happily stay there again!"
2865992,33637111,2015-05-30,26513809,Melissa,We really enjoyed staying with Mike and Lynne. They were very welcoming and had some great suggestions. The room and bed were very comfortable and clean. There's public transport nearby which will take you into the city else it's easy getting in by car. I'd definitely recommend staying here. 
2865992,34471305,2015-06-08,26274523,Debby,"Just as the write up described. Beautiful view. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe. The host and hostess were very nice, welcoming and informative.  This is one of our favorite Airbnbs that we've stayed at so far.  The location is perfect for our needs; and they gave us ideas on local restaurants and places to go close by.  We would highly recommend this location."
2865992,34994769,2015-06-14,32867458,Becky,"This was the perfect spot for me to organise my move to West Seattle.  Mike and Lynne thought of everything I might need to make my stay comfortable and were very helpful!  And, as you can see, the view is spectacular.  "
2865992,35463402,2015-06-19,30801575,Marian,We were thrilled to find this wonderful room with everything we needed for a week stay in West Seattle.  Mike was quick to respond and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The view is wonderful and the room spacious and very comfortable.  We will definitely be staying here when we return to West Seattle!!! Nothing was lacking to make our stay comfortable. Definitely a hidden gem!
2865992,35819286,2015-06-22,33790592,Daisy,Thank you Mike and Lynn. They were very nice and provided us many good tips to experience Seattle. The room was very nice. We enjoyed the view from our room :-)

We were so happy and comfortable to spend couple of days in Mike and Lynn's house, I believe it is the best.  I certainly will refer it to my friends. "
2865992,37127844,2015-07-05,22729169,Sam,"What a great place to stay and what great hosts. Spacious, comfortable, what a view of the Olympic Mountains and what gracious and friendly hosts Mike and Lynne are. Easy walk (up steep slopes mind you) to the bus to downtown. When we are back in Seattle, we'll be back here - no need to seek anywhere else, a sanctuary in the city but you feel you are in the forest and by the sea, even watched a bald eagle fly above us while sitting on the porch. Seek no further, stay here in Seattle!! "
2865992,37699167,2015-07-09,25699022,Yining,"Best experience with Airbnb so far. Mike and Lynne are wonderful host. I really enjoyed the stay at their beautiful house. The room is huge and clean. It has everything that you need. Mike and Lynne helped me plan my trip, and they even prepared a map for me. They gave great travel advise. I would highly recommend their place to anyone will visit seattle. Best value ever!!!! I truly hope I could go back sometime soon! "

2865992,39621931,2015-07-25,1238588,Allison,"This was a Wonderful place to stay.  The room is large and exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The walk-in closet provides ample space and a luxurious feeling.  There is a small deck where you can sit and enjoy the Beautiful view.  The landscaping is beautiful.  Enjoy lovely gardens daily.  Everything is exactly as described, but better.  Mike and Lynn are wonderful hosts, offering a warm welcome and whatever information you may need.  I highly recommend using their book Seattle Stairway walks if you are looking for some guided walks to see Seattle's different neighborhoods.   I will definitely return next time I am visiting family.   Thank you Mike and Lynn!"
2865992,40594873,2015-08-01,34908925,Sharon,"I had a delightful stay with Mike and Lynn.  They were very welcoming when I arrived ... and took me to the lovely room where I was staying.  

The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.  

The room was spacious and was tastefully decorated and had all the ammenities.  I felt quite at home and plan to return!  "
2865992,41528939,2015-08-07,37792993,Charles,Mike and Lynne were more than accommodating.  They are friendly and professional.    Can't wait to return!
2865992,41875999,2015-08-09,7284019,Sara,"This was a perfect place to stay. The guest room and bathroom are on their own level, with a separate exterior entrance, so it feels like a private hotel suite. It was easy to travel to other parts of Seattle during our stay."
2865992,42559660,2015-08-14,28090129,Ellen,This space of Lynn and Mikes is just lovely. So comfortable and beautiful view as promised. They have thought of everything and have detailed instructions on the area and for the suite you are staying in. I couldn't even think of anything to ask them because they were so helpful from the beginning. We stayed four days and were very busy seeing downtown Seattle and loved their western Seattle location also. Great local restaurants and views and parks. 
2865992,43256582,2015-08-18,198665,Lucas,We enjoyed our stay with Mike and Lynne. The room has everything you need from creamer for your coffee to a hair dryer. All you need to bring is clothes! The room has a gorgeous view of the Sound and is in a quiet neighborhood. Their hospitality was incredible and they have such a welcoming and friendly energy. We appreciated their clear communication and we definitely recommend staying with Mike and Lynne.
2865992,43574305,2015-08-20,41413955,Don,"Host greeted us & offered suggestions on activities & restaurants in the area.
Neighborhood very nice and quiet.
Description of unit was accurate."
2865992,43951270,2015-08-23,30946910,Jasmine,"Absolutely amazing. The room, the view and the hosts were the real deal. We would definitely try to stay here again next time we come back. I loved how it was only 15 minutes from downtown yet the neighborhood was cozy, so we got a little bit of both worlds.  Thanks for such a good time, Mike! You guys were awesome!"
2865992,44945527,2015-08-30,12162402,Tracy,"Mike was very hospitable, and the room was extremely quiet and comfortable. If you enjoy waking up to a beautiful view of the water in a peaceful neighborhood, I definitely recommend this listing!"
2865992,47754371,2015-09-21,42303845,Chris,"My wife and I both enjoyed our stay here very much.  There was great attention to detail, like local restaurant suggestions and local attraction materials, ice already made for us in the freezer, water in the fridge.  We felt like we were important to them and not just the tenant of the day.  We would book with them again, and we recommend them without reservation.  Thanks for making our stay such a pleasure."
2865992,48741150,2015-09-28,29213456,Chris Hatt And Charley Baker,"Mike was a great host, he communicated before and during our stay very well. He gave us plenty of tips and ideas of things for us to see and visit. He and his wife both have a great knowledge of Seattle and the Washington state.
Our room was great. Our bed was very warm and comfortable. We had our own bathroom, fridge, microwave, plates and cutlery etc. A really nice and safe area. There are cafés, restaraunts, a supermarket and bus stops which take you into the city, all within a ten minute walk of Mike's home. A fantastic place to stay in Seattle. We highly recommend staying here."
2865992,49487035,2015-10-04,29750347,Kristen,"Mike and Lynn's home is perfect! The first thing I noticed when we walked in was how everything looked and smelled so clean. The room was perfectly put together, and had everything we needed (blow dryer, microwave, dishes and utensils, coffee maker, huge closet with hangers and shelves, etc.). There are maps and bus routes provided in the room, which were very helpful. The views and location were spectacular as well! It was close to the Vashon/Southworth ferry terminal, and a short drive or bus ride to the downtown area. Lots of great restaurants and coffee shops just down the road as well. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Mike and Lynn were able to give us travel tips and suggestions, as this was our first trip to Washington. They are very welcoming, and really make you feel at home. I can't say enough just how perfect this place is, and would recommend to anyone traveling to the area. "
2865992,50457383,2015-10-12,16114300,Cheryl,"Our stay was perfect. Mike and Lynne are very hospitable and excellent hosts. The room was  clean, large and has every amenity you can think of.

the room is clean and comfortable. thanks Mike and Lynne. "
2865992,53809886,2015-11-13,29439719,Mark,Mike and Lynne are wonderful hosts! Their hospitality and willingness to assist along our travel was such a nice plus. Our stay was perfect and they have a beautiful location. Would love to stay with them again if we are ever back in Seattle!

7149703,40795978,2015-08-02,3080284,Miroslav,"I made a two week visit to Seattle, staying at private room - enjoyed the stay very much. The host was very hospitable and kind.  The room is spacious, clean. The toilet is decent and I felt comfortable using the other facilities of the flat as well. Neighborhood seemed safe - Downtown Seattle is within walking distance which is convenient if you use public transport. Being not sensitive to noise I would add that traffic from the motorway and proximity of the main entrance of the building can probably be something to consider if the traveler needs full silence. Altogether my experience was fairly good and I recommend the place. "
7149703,40984382,2015-08-03,31184431,Luke,"Noora was great, responded quickly to messages, really hospitable, and was fun to talk with.

The room was very spacious, bed was super comfortable, shower pressure was great. Located within walking distance of many places and easy to get to public transportation. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
7149703,42354350,2015-08-12,40742725,Daniel,"Noora was great about responding to messages quickly and setting up the visit was easy. When we got there Noora and her apartment were warm and inviting and made us feel very comfortable. She was great company and had fantastic recommendations about what to do in the area. The apartment was great, very comfortable bed and the location is perfect with easy access to restaurants and bars in cap hill and a quick walk to downtown. Cannot recommend staying here highly enough. "
7149703,42641233,2015-08-14,12340056,Julia,"Noora was very nice and accommodating at the last minute. The room was small but the bed was comfortable, and there were quite a few bars/restaurants in close walking distance, as well as being a 25 minute walk to Pike's market and downtown area."
7149703,44166319,2015-08-24,34708616,Jerry,"Right in the middle of capitol hill, walking distance from shops, stores, coffee. Parking is very limited. I suggest walk or uber."
7149703,44671648,2015-08-28,39386667,Alec,Noora is lovely. The apartment is beautiful and right where you want to be in Capitol Hill. Had an awesome week. Strong recommend!
7149703,44982083,2015-08-30,37867724,Elaine,"Great location, walking distance to everywhere. Close to the freeway so a little noisy but we were able to sleep perfectly. Noora was a lovely host, informative and also left us to our own devices which was great. Good communication at all times before and after our stay. thanks Noora."
7149703,45389975,2015-09-02,13381763,Gabe,Noora was very welcoming and made our stay have aa wonderful personal touch to it. From the coffee to the constant communication me and the friend that were staying there had a great time before going out to hike in the Olympic Mountains. Location is great and her place was clean and comfortable. Would stay again.
7149703,45709624,2015-09-05,33610860,Alexandra,"Noora was so great! She wasn't able to meet us when we were getting in to the city, but her boyfriend let us in and was very kind. When we finally met Noora the next morning, she made us coffee (which was fantastic)! She was flexible about when we could get there and check out. The photos were accurate about what her place looked like and the bed was so comfortable! I would stay there again next time I stop in the city. "
7149703,46648666,2015-09-12,42952717,Dani,Noora makes you feel right at home. She was very friendly and fun to be around. She was very flexible with arrival and departure time.  Also provided wonderful recommendations about places to eat and visit.
7149703,47820385,2015-09-21,29647054,Chad,Noora was very welcoming an went above and beyond to insure my stay was comfortable. Her apartment is settled in a quiet neighborhood with plenty in walking distance. Despite being just a few thousand feet from I-5 I never once heard the traffic. If/when I'm in Seattle again I'd definitely try to stay here first.
7149703,48315554,2015-09-25,40943765,Giuseppe,"Great location at walking distance from several restaurants, bar and the Westlake station. Noora was very welcoming and made me really enjoy my staying. "

The room was also quite spacious and comfortable. We had a great time in Seattle and loved our stay with Noora, who was very helpful and gave us lots of recommendations on things to do."
7149703,51354621,2015-10-19,27246685,Matt,Wonderful AirBnB experience. Noora was most welcoming and full of suggestions to visit. Many thanks for hosting me. 
7149703,51489445,2015-10-20,28320450,Heather,Cute apartment very central to where I wanted to be. Bed is very comfortable and the room is spacious for someone with lots of luggage. Noora was a very gracious host and very welcoming. My trip was brief but would definitely recommend the apartment to future guests.
7149703,51811114,2015-10-24,17813600,Julie,"Noora was a great host. She was very flexible with check in and check out times, and made me feel as if it was my home. The home was cozy,  clean, and I loved the scented candles! Location in capitol hill was great and I could walk to many coffee shop's/ restraunts and very convienient to pike place market, and the Space needle. I would definately recommend Noora's place. Thank you :) "
7149703,52133389,2015-10-26,2119465,Smita,"Nice apartment in a very convenient part of Seattle - a short walk to downtown, easy access to all that Capital Hill has to offer. The room is clean, comfortable and quite spacious, and the common areas are very well kept. I was there for a wedding and out most of the time so didn't get to see Noora very much, but she was extremely responsive, helpful and friendly both on messenger and in person. "
7149703,53118231,2015-11-05,6452168,Christina,"Noora's place is adorable and incredibly convenient to a host of great Seattle spots. We could walk to all of the Capitol Hill bars and coffee shops, and it was a quick drive to anywhere else in the city (7 minutes to downtown, 10 to the University area). The room was comfortable, the pillows to die for, and we were made to feel incredibly welcome. Finding parking required a bit of patience, but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy part of the city. "
7149703,53496533,2015-11-09,27709385,Arijit,"The place was pretty conveniently located, not too far from downtown but not too close to the hustle and bustle either. Noora was very accommodating in terms of check-in and check-out times and in general was prompt, responsive, and friendly whenever we interacted. The room, though on the smaller side, was pretty cozy and actually worked out okay in terms of space for me since I didn't have too much stuff with me. Overall, it's a definite recommendation.  "
7149703,53793389,2015-11-12,27970121,Alex,Noora was a very welcoming host and her spot is extremely well located. My girl and I loved staying here. So good it was that we left some flower for her in appreciation.
7149703,54266260,2015-11-17,12518666,Ray,"Noora was a great host. It's a really cozy spot in a great location! 

The apt is very minimalist but has all the essentials. Clean, fresh bed and bedding, cool lighting in the room, wifi, toiletries. 

As mentioned, the location is great! It is in the middle of Cap Hill and walking distance from many great bars and restaurants. It's even close enough to walk to downtown (~1.5 mi) which has a lot more things to do.

One potential problem you might run into: Noora's listing on the directory at the entrance doesn't actually contact her. I suggest confirming with her beforehand on your expected arrival time to ensure you aren't stranded outside... in Seattle where it rains a lot. It most likely won't be an issue since Noora is very responsive and came to get me within a couple minutes but just something to keep in mind.

Overall, it is great value and you will enjoy your stay."
7149703,55269153,2015-11-29,48801066,Nelly,"Although I arrived a late night, I still felt completely welcomed by Nora. She offered me a warm tea and showed me the nice view of the building. As I sort of made myself at home and she was no problem with it. I was lucky to have a great chat with her and she was so fun to talk to. The house is exactly like the description, cozy, warm and lovely. I wish I could stay there longer!"
7149703,56045415,2015-12-08,41428121,Mitchell,"Lovely apartment maintained by someone that likes good things and is incredibly easy (and interesting) to talk to. Noora helped make my first trip to Seattle so memorable that it was really difficult to board the plane back to Boston, and when I inevitably visit again, I hope Noora will allow me to stay with her once more."
7149703,56522803,2015-12-14,27614097,Brandon,"Noora is super super welcoming and hospitable. The place is in a really convenient  location. Would definitely stay at Capitol hill over downtown, so really hit jackpot. Taking uber from the place was super easy. The bed was comfortable and the room is very spacious. Would also recommend getting a tarot reading from Noora aswell. :) "
7389950,43159251,2015-08-17,251821,Linda,"Absolutely felt welcome to Donghwan's home.  The room and bathroom were spotless, immaculate.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious.  Loved the rooftop deck with a view of Lake Union.  Great location near the UW.  I would highly recommend this room."

7389950,44043632,2015-08-23,41497390,Michael,"Our visit to friends in Seattle was greatly enhanced by the excellent accommodations and gracious hospitality provided by our hosts, DJ and Olivia. Their home is comfortable, clean and beautifully designed, with a splendid backyard garden and views of Lake Washington. It's situated in a very safe and charming residential area about 10 minutes from the University District. The guest quarters on the top floor are very bright and quiet, and the bed was quite comfortable, with private bathroom facilities en suite. A fresh and ample breakfast is available in the dining room, which is reserved for visiting guests. A rooftop deck and balcony are also available for the exclusive use of guests. There's a horticultural center, with trails and views, a short walk from the house.  Parking was readily available right in front of the house. 

The Jeons are a young couple with children. Our privacy was respected at all times and we never heard a sound during normal sleeping hours. Either DJ or Olivia were immediately available at all times to answer questions about their home and neighborhood. Our hosts were determined to make our visit as restful and comfortable as possible, and they succeeded impressively. We're looking forward to staying with them again on our next visit to Seattle, and we can recommend our hosts and this wonderful home without hesitation. "
7389950,44386816,2015-08-25,42075661,Dan,"Donghwan and his family made our two-night stay in their Seattle home warm, relaxing, and comfortable. Donghwan was very accommodating and helpful! His house is absolutely stunning, especially the rooftop deck which we had full access to. The room was clean and spacious - the bed was one of the comfiest beds we've ever slept in! The breakfasts were simple yet satisfying, including access to a Keurig coffee maker. 

Overall, beautiful home, great, quiet neighborhood close to many charming areas of the city, and clean, tidy room! If we are in the Seattle area again, we will definitely be back. "
7389950,45135343,2015-08-31,39985811,Nancy,"DJ and Olivia's home was just perfect for us. The checkin was easy, DJ was very prompt to respond to all of our messages. The queen sized bed was very comfortable, the sheets were nice, crisp and cotton. The bed and bathroom setup is roomy and clean. The house interior has its original wood and all of its charm. Olivia provided us with fruit, pastries, juice, coffee and tea. The dining area has a lovely view of their gorgeous and mature garden. We look forward to staying with them again, when we return to Seattle. Very safe neighborhood which is close to our daughter's U of Washington apartment. We can highly recommend. "
7389950,48046487,2015-09-22,4463308,New,"I throughly enjoyed my time at the house. It was very peaceful and just as it is portrayed (website hidden) and Olivia were very friendly and sweet to me. I stayed there for my business trip to the Seattle area. I searched for airbnbs because most hotels in the downtown were extremely expensive. If you want a quality stay at less than half the price of regular hotels in the area, this is the place for you. I would definitely come back next time I am in Seattle."
7389950,48604229,2015-09-27,37069380,Nolan,"Host was very accommodating for a late check-in and communication was very good. House is in a nice neighborhood and right across the street from walking paths through a preserve. The overlook of Lake Union was very nice for my morning coffee. House is close to great shopping, restaurants, and the UW for games (walking distance)."
7389950,49561170,2015-10-04,39868233,Jeremy,"This was my first time using AirBnb. I booked with (website hidden) sent me a message and I showed up at his place at the check in (website hidden) and Olivia are very friendly people and the communication and accommodation was pleasant and straight forward. It's a beautiful room and home, the pictures are accurate. They provide a small but plentiful breakfast. The bathroom has some supplies if you don't have enough and there are instructions within the room regarding wi-fi and nearby shopping. This exceeded my expectations. I would book again if I visited Seattle."
7389950,50509941,2015-10-12,4301062,Haobing,"We stayed in Donghwan's house for 3 days and it is an amazing experience. They have a comfortable bedroom, nice garden, and they provide good breakfast, too. We 'll definitely come back next time. "
7389950,51328084,2015-10-19,16483847,IkkJin,"Donghwan and Olivia are a lovely couple with two children. Their house is architecturally gorgeous, and I would highly recommend to check their place if you are into design or architecture. It is in a peaceful neighborhood, right next to walking paths through preserves, and in the meantime walking distance to University Village shopping center. By the way, I didn't end up visiting the mall since I wanted to spend more reading time on their balcony overlooking Lake Union. I hope to visit Jeon's family soon!"
7389950,53499049,2015-11-09,46315724,Yelena,"We had a very pleasant stay at Donghwan and Olivia's home for 3 days. Neighborhood is very quiet and house is as pictured, beautiful and well kept. Waterview from the bedroom and zen garden outside guest dining/breakfast area were spectacular. Everything exceeded our expectations, could not have asked for more. Thank you! "
7389950,54903679,2015-11-25,48074230,Hyunjee,"We enjoyed our stay at Donghwan's airbnb for three nights during our visit to Seattle. The location is in a very nice neighborhood right next to the UW and also a short drive to the downtown. The room is kept clean, and attached bathroom can be separated by a door from rest of the house. Good breakfast is provided in a formal dining area with a gorgeous view. There is a trail to the nature preserve right in front of the house! We really enjoyed walking it in the morning."
4250938,27775461,2015-03-11,213850,Jeffrey,The house was just as described and ready when we arrived. The house was fully furnished with a number of small details to make us really feel welcome. We would definitely stay here again.
4250938,41483511,2015-08-07,12883513,Michael,Listing as described. Easy key-code entry. Host was responsive before arrival. We enjoyed our stay and our trip went smoothly. Thanks!
3594885,16931898,2014-08-04,7978992,Anthony,"The unit was as advertised, clean, and well maintained.  The building was in a great location and the price was fair for the area.  Matan was a great host: quick responses, seamless check-in/out, eager to make sure his guests were well accommodated.  I would definitely recommend renting from Matan."
3594885,18921106,2014-09-02,3404759,Jeff,"Matan is a great host! He is very quick to respond to messages and accommodating to questions and needs for your trip. Check-in/check-out was a breeze and completely stress free. The location of his apartment is tremendous, there is so much to see and do in the area, you definitely will not be bored! 

The apartment itself was extremely clean and spacious. We had a party of 4 and Matan had two air mattresses inflated and prepared with bedding ready for us which was very much appreciated! 

The apartment building is very cool. It's a modern place, very secure, and it has an amazing rooftop to enjoy.

This was our first time in Seattle and staying at Matan's made everything very smooth and enjoyable. From location to Matan's hosting, staying here sets you up to have a tremendous stay in Seattle!"
3594885,20042434,2014-09-22,20895668,Hunter,"Neighborhood's cool. To us, it appeared to be college-aged bar hoppers, 20's-30's something hipsters and gutter punks mixed in with the local gay scene. The bars/restaurants were good, not tourist traps. We much preferred this area to the others we visited: downtown, U-District and Fremont.

Matan was the ideal host. He was one text/phone call away, but he didn't meddle. Checking in/out was easy."
3594885,26683496,2015-02-17,8761045,Kaitlan,"My girlfriends and I wanted to escape to Seattle for a long weekend and came across Matan's listing. I messaged him and heard back right away. He made it very easy- from helping me book my first airbnb stay, to giving my friends and me directions and instructions for the weekend. 

We arrived late on a Friday and he was kind enough to set up two air mattresses in the living room and to set out towels and the like for the duration of our stay. Any questions or concerns were answered immediately. We had mixed up our departing flight times and he was gracious enough to let us stay later in the afternoon than we had intended originally. I would definitely look to stay at this apartment again if I make it back to Seattle. It was clean, convenient, and easy. "
3594885,28824218,2015-03-30,29247667,Zubin,"The condo location is fantastic, can't be beat.  Otherwise, the interior is clean and sparse (as the photo shows).  Overall, I enjoyed my stay here."
3594885,31065114,2015-05-01,28249634,Stephen,"Stayed at Matan's place for 5 nights, two weeks ago and would gladly stay again. The location was perfect, the house was lovely and it was close to everything. Matan was a fantastic host and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend staying here if you visit. "
3594885,31918482,2015-05-11,12521952,Jason,Great place and location! Matan was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend! 
3594885,32285931,2015-05-16,21603525,Shawn,"The perfect location for staying in Seattle. You're close to everything...great restaurants are within walking distance. The roof top area is great to enjoy and the gym has everything you need to keep in shape. Maten was a great host and would certainly stay here again when working in Seattle. The apartment is exactly like the pictures show. If you're wanting to stay in what will be the new hip area of Seattle, this is the spot. "
7957904,44074774,2015-08-23,38982236,Abdulkarim,"I staied there with my wife for one night. The apartment was clean and organized. However, there are two things that we didn't like there. First, the cupboard for clothes was full of his personal clothes, so we didn't find a place to put our clothes. Secondly, there was some used clothes in a basket inside the bedroom that we used to stay!"
7957904,46361256,2015-09-09,2623066,Kaitlyn,"I booked Brian's place very last minute- hours before I arrived! I appreciated how neat and tidy his space was even with my short notice. With that, Im giving Brian a 5/5 for his responsiveness(he got back to me very quickly!), cleanliness, and for the location. This was one of my better Airbnb stays. It was a stress-free experience; and I would definitely stay here again."
1256883,5760494,2013-07-15,795467,Joyce,"This clean, modern, basement apartment was perfect for our family of 4.  Marshall met us for a quick orientation of the newly refurbished, spacious 2 bedroom/1 bath upon our arrival.  We loved the private entrance, well appointed kitchen, and quiet neighborhood - it exceeded our expectations.  The bus (a couple of  blocks away) gets you downtown in about 15 minutes, but it does get crowded along the way, so we often took cabs to get where we needed to go for just a few bucks more.  Walkable to the Capitol Hill district with shopping/restaurants/clubs - just wear comfortable shoes.   Be aware if you're a light sleeper that this is a basement apartment, so there will be some noise/footsteps up above.  But, overall for us -- a perfect experience, and I highly recommend it if you're open to staying a short distance outside the downtown area.  "
1256883,5870934,2013-07-20,7240001,Jerry,Very comfortable and nicely updated apartment. My family was in town for the week while my son had surgery at the University. This apartment is a short 10 minutes to the medical center. A perfect location for our needs. Marshall met us for brief orientation upon our arrival and was very responsive when we had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi (problem quickly resolved). He was a great host and we look forward to staying at his place again.
1256883,5901535,2013-07-21,498934,Matthew,Awesome stay very central to downtown train and bus connections. Host was very responsive and helpful!
1256883,6374299,2013-08-10,6374981,Beth,"My adult daughter and I just stayed in Marshall's basement apartment for 5 days in early August. The location is quiet, and was quite close to a number of bus routes, which my daughter figured out with Google Maps on her iPhone. The apartment is spacious, very clean, and had everything we needed. It was great having so much room. Marshall was a good host and helped with restaurant suggestions, etc. There are plenty of excellent choices in the nearby Capitol Hill area. We enjoyed our stay and would be happy to come back."
1256883,6407044,2013-08-11,182522,Aliza,Out stay in Marshall's lovely apartment was great. The apartment is spacious and clean. It was an easy easy walk to all of Capitol Hill. Marshall was friendly and provided restaurant and tourist assistance. We would stay there again for sure. 
1256883,6657499,2013-08-20,6216231,Caroline,"Marshall's place is in an ideal location, close to everything and still has a safe, neighborhood feel!  I arrived late on a Saturday night and was greeted with chocolates on each bed and a bottle of prosecco in the refrigerator!  The inside of the apartment was spacious with an enormous kitchen, living space, walk-in closet and a super comfy bed.  Marshall thought of everything and I even enjoyed a few visits from his adorable cat! "
1256883,6873438,2013-08-28,7740711,Joleine,"Huge thanks to Marshall! His apartment was perfect for our little family.  Having the 2 bedrooms for the kids to nap/sleep while we hung out and watched tv was great! I'd rent his apartment any day over a hotel.  The close proximity to downtown, I5 and tons of restaurants made our stay even better! "
1256883,7012719,2013-09-03,7363398,Sarah,Space was clean. Communication was great! Would stay here again. 
1256883,7166838,2013-09-09,2291271,Prakash,Spacious and extremely clean. Easily walkable to all the happenings and Marshall was extremely friendly (we met him when we arrived).  Would absolutely stay there again!
1256883,7294789,2013-09-14,8739825,Olivia,"This place was great! Very clean and nice, great location in proximity to downtown Seattle. Marshall greeted us when we got there with chocolates. Excellent pick, we would definitely come back."
1256883,7510016,2013-09-23,1614134,Cam,"Marshall was a great host, always quick to answer questions, and very accommodating. The apartment was clean, full amenities, in a great neighborhood with easy access to other parts of Seattle. I would definitely stay here again."
1256883,8346438,2013-10-27,732749,David,"We spent a month at Marshall's place, while we were finding our permanent place in Seattle. Our stay felt like being at home throughout. Marshall was always available to answer all of our questions, and we had no problems at all with the house. We had some room to spare, so a friend came all the way from Spain to visit, at no extra cost! The neighborhood is lovely; it's on a very quiet street (quiet as in ""a couple of squirrels living around""), and it's at a reasonably distace from the city center (SLU/Downtown)... We walked there a couple of times before we got our ORCA cards. There are buses nearby to go north/south and east/west, and plenty of space to park your own car, so no problems with transportation. There's a Safeway really nearby, and a couple of cool places to have dinner (check foursquare!). Don't hesitate and stay at Marshall's, it's an awesome place! Thanks Marshall for your help while we were settling in Seattle!"
1256883,8566656,2013-11-05,8903602,Leigh,This was a totally great space so much so that I would love to rent it again.  The neighborhood is very cozy and quiet to the point that you forget you are in the middle of Seattle.  Marshall was a great host and was very attentive to our needs which were none.  Everything was perfect I couldn't have asked for a better wedding weekend.
1256883,8653418,2013-11-11,8409865,Bernard,"Bien situé dans le quartier résidentiel Capitol Hill. rue calme mais pas très loin de quelques commerces.
Appartement bien distinct, dans une grande maisons, avec entrée indépendante, cuisine très bien équipée, et des couchages pour 4 dans deux chambres séparées.
Les quelques rideaux aux fenêtres sont un peu légers pour disposer d'une intimité réelle, mais on s'y fait.
Marshal est à notre disposition en cas de besoin, ce qui est bien pratique si on arrive tard comme moi (vers 22h)"
1256883,8781312,2013-11-18,8261863,Michael,"The apartment was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped and even had a big pot to steam crabs.  Marshall was helpful with suggestions of restaurants and with directions.  The location was great!"
1256883,9521210,2014-01-01,8817267,Agi,"We booked for a month while looking for a permanent home locally. Overall the space was fine. I will admit it wasn't as nice as I expected as it is a daylight basement unit (short ceilings, uneven floor). However, it was very comfortable and the rooms spacious. Having warm floors from the radiant heating was a plus during the cold month of December! Marshall was quick to rectify anything needed, and also let us borrow some tools. Marshall even tried to help us get our PS3 on wifi. He's a pretty nice guy and easy going. Since we are living in the same 'hood now I'm sure we'll run into him on occasion.

The cable TV isn't much. Just a handful of local channels. That was disappointing, but not a huge deal. The wifi was fast. Having a private laundry room was great. Again low ceilings so if you're a tall person be aware.

The big negative issue is that we booked this unit b/c of the dog friendly policy. However, what Marshall did not know is that the long-term tenant on the main floor would have a problem. Our dog, while well behaved and  crate trained, would bark at times when we were away. She got used to the space this happened less, however the erratic noise from upstairs apparently sent our dog into protective mode and she would bark. (The triplex is a converted home so you can hear footsteps and such.) The tenant above asked that we take our dog with us whenever she or her roommate were home, and I mean ANYTIME. Not just nighttime. We tried our best to accommodate but it wasn't always realistic. We began to crate our dog in the bathroom as above was theirs, just to lessen any noise from their living spaces. However this wasn't enough. Of the handful of times TOTAL that our dog was home alone while they were there, and every time I gave them notice as a courtesy, this tenant sent me text messages complaining. The last time there was literally 15 minutes between two emails I received and then a snarky text. We had been gone for 30ish minutes and it was a saturday afternoon. Sheesh! Uptight much? To top it off we weren't ever violating any city noise ordinances.

In hindsight we would have said tough. We paid for our ENTIRE family to have use of the space for one month. Really this is Marshall's mistake, and a little compromise on her part would have been nice. His solution was to put us in contact with each other for communication. In the end, while well-intentioned, it didn't work. I doubt he will ever allow dogs again. (By the way, our dog liked him plenty. Just not the gal upstairs. Ironic.)

All that aside, I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone without pets. It's a great location, a home away from home atmosphere, easy street parking and an attentive homeowner."
1256883,9728904,2014-01-06,10951013,Katie,Great place and really clean. Kitchen well equipped with necessary tools. Marshall was helpful and a great host. Thanks!
1256883,10674283,2014-03-03,6539367,Andrew,"The place was very clean and very comfortable.  The kitchen came in handy as my friend and I didn't want to eat out all the time.  The couch sleeps one quite nicely and all the beds provided a good night's sleep.  Laundry access didn't hurt.  The location was pretty great as well: a short walk to capitol hill restaurants, grocery stores, and night life or an even shorter bus ride (we had a bunch of bus route options).  About 2 miles from downtown Seattle, which was close enough.  Cabs from downtown ran like $8, so that was fine. There's a friendly area cat that visited us as well!   I highly recommend."
1256883,11218005,2014-03-25,3617637,Erin,"I had a great time staying in Marshall's place for a few days with colleagues while we were in town for a conference. Very cozy and well-located - just a few blocks from several bus lines as well as groceries, coffee shops, and friendly bars (we had a good time at The Neighbor Lady on Union St.). I would warn the very tall that since the place is a basement apartment, it might feel cramped if you're over, say, 6 feet. (We are all about 5'9 and felt comfortable.)  "
1256883,12889242,2014-05-13,13446938,Tiina,"We found Marshall's place nice. The location was easy to reach by car and parking space was available in the street in front of the house. 
All in all good value for the money."
1256883,12938272,2014-05-14,2760758,Ivan,"Marshall's apartment was amazing, the place was spotless when we arrived. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle. Great neighborhood to explore, there's even a trader joes a short walk west of the apartment."
1256883,13596754,2014-06-01,336454,Michael,"Marshall's Capitol Hill apartment is a spacious, basement apartment. Since it has two bedrooms, my wife and I had more than ample space. The apartment is very centrally located with public transportation, restaurants, and grocery stores in easy walking distance. The apartment was very clean. WIFI worked (website hidden) had limited cable, but as we were out most of the time, we really didn't need more. Kitchen was adequately stocked. Laundry was great to have. And there was a very friendly cat who visited us quite often. The one downside is that being a basement apartment, we could hear the tenant upstairs walking around. It wasn't too disturbing, but it was there. Although we had few encounters with Marshall--he was out of town upon our arrival--he seemed easy to get along with and answered our questions. We really didn't have to get in touch with him very much as everything worked out well. We were very satisfied with our stay."
1256883,13920075,2014-06-08,14251815,Dylan,"Our stay was great.   The apt. was clean and plenty of natural light for a basement unit.  Never met Marshall, but we communicated via text a few times.
The unit is in a quiet neighborhood with a little grassy area out front that was perfect for the family.  It's not that close to the heart of Capitol Hill, but I guess that's why it's so peaceful!"
1256883,14247479,2014-06-15,16005050,Joshua,"Basement apartment was great for 3 of us, and Marshall was very helpful in recommending places to visit to experience Seattle. Apartment was clean and well kept, we enjoyed our stay! Easy $8 Uber ride to downtown, perfect basecamp for Seattle!"
1256883,15515941,2014-07-10,17645712,Paul,"This is a great little space that easily accommodated 5 of us. It is quaint, clean, comfortable, and is located in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. It was very easy to find street parking around the house. Though we didn't meet Marshall in person, he politely made himself available to us via phone and e-mail. Overall good experience. Recommended. "
1256883,17626540,2014-08-15,17619232,Jennifer,"My four friends and I really enjoyed our stay at Marshall's place. Marshall promptly responded to our questions and made sure our check-in went smoothly. The place was spacious and comfortable for the five of us.  Four of us slept in the bedrooms and one of us slept on a cot in the living room. We also liked that it was clean and had all the amenities that we needed. It definitely worked for us and we all slept well! Also, the location was great since it was not so congested and only a short drive to downtown.  We liked the surrounding neighborhood since there were a couple coffee shops we could walk to."
1256883,19388322,2014-09-11,3097447,Karina,"We didn't meet Marshall, but he gave us great instructions about how to access the rental.  The rental was as described in the listing and the photos accurately show what it looks like."
1256883,19831663,2014-09-19,4169153,Bryan,Great place and everything went very smoothly!  Clean and perfect for our needs.  15-20 min walk or less than a $10 dollar cab ride to capital hill area.
1256883,19938309,2014-09-21,18731148,Loren,Marshall as our host was really nice and helpful. He was very quick in responding. We felt comfortable in his basement unit and had everything we needed. Sometimes it was a little bit noisy hearing all steps from the unit above in the early morning. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and just a short drive to Downtown. 
1256883,20250072,2014-09-26,6981679,Emmett,"The place was great!  We needed some additional bed linens and Marshall was down with a whole box of sheets and blankets in two minutes.  It's a really good location, too.  The bar two blocks away had good food and a kitchen open late."
1256883,21794966,2014-10-24,22022542,Heidi,"The host was very accommodating.  Nice area of Seattle, house worked well for our family of 4. "

1256883,25510231,2015-01-18,14816995,Jewel,"Marshall was prompt, nice and responsive.  What we rented is not what is shown as an entire home/apt ..but a basement flat.  Aside from that (got over the disappointment quickly) - the place was clean and comfortable."
1256883,25793628,2015-01-26,24664011,Martha,Our stay was quite pleasant.  Apartment was light and comfortable.  Location was very convenient. 
1256883,25976102,2015-01-31,1742991,Ashley,We stayed here just for one night for my birthday. It was close to the spots we were going and a cheap uber ride away. Yet it was quite enough to sleep. It was clean and comfortable. I loved the claw foot tub so cute. We Would stay here again next time.
1256883,28080014,2015-03-17,18263703,Sheree,The neighborhood was really quiet. Apartment is nice and cozy. Location is great! Walking distance to anything you may need. The Neighbor Lady has amazing food. 
1256883,28131671,2015-03-18,18263703,Sheree,This review is because I added an extra night. Marshall is a gracious host. Location is great. Neighborhood is quiet. Walking distance to everything 
1256883,28518375,2015-03-25,12041211,Lim,"Great location, less than 10 min drive (uber $7-9) to capitol hills.
Marshall was a great host with awesome communication skills.
Myself and 3 staffs were staying at his place for convention and we had to receive several packages (4 large boxes) via ups and dhl, he was nice enough to receive and place them safely on his front porch which made very convenience for me.
Plenty of street parking space for my rental car and uhaul truck. It was a perfect location and affordable place. We cooked and even did laundry.
I had to stay one more day and he accommodate our team with same price we paid initially.
I definitely recommend this place and will visit his house again for next seattle trip! "
1256883,31691451,2015-05-09,526722,Allen,The space was great and the neighborhood was quiet. Marshall was very quick to attend to our needs and overall had a good experience at the place. 
1256883,31838914,2015-05-10,13007832,Nghia,"The host was very gracious and flexible. The listing was nice and looked like the pictures presented. The host was available to be contacted at all times with any questions or concerns. 

However, the listing is a basement level unit, so don't expect access to the entire house -- which I found out when I arrived on check-in day. Also there are people living upstairs so noise is a huge concern. If you are looking for a place that is private or to have people over past 10PM, this isn't the place for you.  "
1256883,32249540,2015-05-16,24708903,Juliet,Great place. Loved it. 
1256883,32727294,2015-05-20,12537354,Flora,Very nice place to stay. Close to downtown and quite. Also Marshall is so thoughtful. Highly recommend!
1256883,32861688,2015-05-22,33470514,Gregory,The place was so convenient and comfortable. Many thanks to our gracious host. Thank you!
1256883,34085024,2015-06-04,6826810,Art,Had a great stay. Spacious 2 bedroom with plenty of room. The unit had everything we needed. Great location. Very walkable to all the Capitol Hill spots. 
1256883,34707776,2015-06-11,31559297,Tianrui,Mr Marshall Carter give me detailed information about the room
1256883,35058885,2015-06-15,11820381,Karen,"great location convenient to the capitol hill area with a walkable, enjoyable neighborhood.  The apartment was as described and perfect for our needs.  "
1256883,35422816,2015-06-18,35421299,Danielle,"On the positive side, great location, clean place, easy access and parking. On the not so great side, rock hard beds ( is that a wood mattress? ) super low ceilings, no cable, no good shower...which kinda goes with the low ceiling, once you step up in the tub, head is at the ceiling, and it's hand held, we're tall so it wasn't cool. "
1256883,37787797,2015-07-10,36546295,Marvin,"Everything was wonderful! Great location, close to bus stops and a grocery store.  Not too much space but enough for what we needed.  Would have loved for the place to have more cooking supplies but other than that it was a great stay in Seattle!"
1256883,37833998,2015-07-11,333173,Kathy,"Marshall's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. A wonderful place for the price. The beds were firm but comfortable. We slept great! "
1256883,38146287,2015-07-13,34068382,Evgeny,"We were a group of 6 hikers and we had just returned from a four day backcountry trip. We were extremely grateful when we walked in to this very clean and well remodeled unit. Everything was tidy and the sheets were clean. The kitchen is very nice and large, and the two bedrooms were spacious with tons of storage. Its also close to lots of trendy and popular restaurants/bars/shops in Seattle which is a big plus if you're sight seeing and exploring."
1256883,40880578,2015-08-03,22411075,Marc,"We used Marshall BNB for one night in July 2015 with a family of 4. The rental is spacious and in a pleasant neighborhood.
The advertised picture is a bit misleading: the picture shows the main house, the rental is in a low-ceiling basement with little light and ventilation. Our first question after arrival was handled quickly and accurately. When the inside temperature rose to 84 F and we asked for a solution, the response arrived the next morning (without a real solution). We had an uncomfortable warm night. 
We experienced the same issue about the shower reported by others: too low, not effective. The beds were hard but not too hard to prevent a good night's sleep. 
We did not use the garden for dinner because the furniture was not clean and access required that we walked through a low overhanging tree. Some items in the kitchen were not clean either. Sanitary facilities and the living did seem clean. Compared to other rentals, the decoration of this one was rather Spartan."
1256883,42395339,2015-08-13,34762244,Lucy,"Marshall is a nice host. The WiFi connection didn't work in the first 2 days which was a bit annoying, but it was promptly fixed by Marshall when he was back from vacation. Overall, the room was clean and spacious for kids, the neighbourhood was quite, and our staying was pleasant!"
1256883,43538290,2015-08-20,35421838,Peiran,"The place is clean and close to Seattle Downtown. Although it is a half-basement, the light is still enough. Overall, nice place!"
1256883,44429820,2015-08-26,37622592,Molly,"Loved the neighborhood.    Great restaurants.   It's centrally located, so it was easy to get to all the places we wanted to go.    It was quiet and clean.   "
1256883,45252562,2015-09-01,35499149,Eric,Marshal was a helpful host able to answer all of our questions. the space itself could use a little more light but was clean and was enough space to accomidate the four of us comfortably. The neighborhood was nice and is within walking distance to a grocery store. two of the beds were to firm for my liking and squeaked quite a bit. Overall a pleasant place to stay at a reasonable price.
1256883,47161748,2015-09-16,29634795,Sean,"Marshall was a very accommodating host - allowed us late check out and was helpful in recommending specific local spots that would fit our wants/need.  

The apartment is in good shape, but does have fairly low ceilings, so it may not be the best for someone who is above 6'3"" or so (especially since the shower is raised off the bathroom floor).  Although there is cable, the channel selection is limited (no ESPN, CNN, etc. so don't expect to catch MNF).  It was a bit warm in the unit, but we were hesitant to leave windows open as there were no screens to prevent bugs from coming in.  although to be fair, we never asked Marshall to fix, so perhaps it was just our own fault.  Overall the place was good, in a nice/quiet neighborhood, but the little things became annoyances."
1256883,48422533,2015-09-26,42875046,Bryan,"Great host! Great communication and a big help. The place is really nice and quite spacious. Our party of 6 had more than enough room. Clean and had everything we needed. Wifi is a bit slow but made us go outside and enjoy seattle more, #firstworldproblem"
1256883,48729748,2015-09-28,6328508,Dan,"Marshall was an excellent host. Very friendly and offered tips on local highlights. Suite was larger than expected, comfortable and (website hidden) drawbacks were the shower was a bit low for those of us over 6 feet and the single beds were a bit short. Great location and overall a great experience. "
1256883,49261614,2015-10-02,41506137,Samantha,"My first Airbnb stay was at Marshall's place and I couldn't be happier. It was just the right space for the group of four and such a good deal! We were able to get everywhere we needed to go and visit within 15-20 minutes. The basement apartment was spacious and had a great kitchen to whip up a quick meal. Which we did twice during our stay! The rooms were clean and we had enough towels and extra linens. It is a basement apartment so just be aware if you're tall the shower might be a little small. But overall we had a great time and enjoyed the space. If I'm ever in Seattle again I know where I'll be staying. 
Thanks Marshall! "
1256883,50071886,2015-10-09,39570731,Silvia,"we had a great stay at marshall´s place. it wasn´t very far from the City. the bus station is just 2 blocks from the house. it was noisy from the flat upstairs. we haven´t met marshall personally. The only negative thing was, that we couldn´t store our luggage somewhrer before 3pm."
1256883,50759542,2015-10-14,5243246,T.J.,"Place is super basic. Luckily we just needed a place to crash for the night. The shower is maybe the worst shower in the world. The other reviews don't lie. It was clean, check in and out was easy, Marshall was a good communicator and helped us get a late checkout. Also - the wifi is really really awful. Place was fine for us because we were hardly there but I wouldn't stay here again."
1256883,51261168,2015-10-19,1175011,Lachlan,"We had a lovely stay at Marshall's place. It was very convenient for downtown with great transport nearby. The six of us fit in the apartment with no troubles at all. 

The neighborhood is pretty and felt very safe to wander around. There is a playground a couple of blocks away for the children. There are lots of nice eateries nearby and food trucks too!

We didn't actually meet Marshall, but his property manager was lovely and helped us with a couple of questions. 

We highly recommend Marshall's place!"
1256883,52682042,2015-11-01,41011323,Edgar,"The listing was exactly as described. It was in a great neighborhood -- quiet; close to downtown; and within walking distance to restaurants, shops and other convenient locations. The apartment itself was very spacious and was much better than staying at a motel would have been. Marshal had a binder with a lot of useful information about the apartment, house rules, and for exploring the area. I had little interaction with Marshall (my choice) but when we did exchange emails, he was very helpful and informative. Also, there was hardly a need to contact him because the listing and binder described everything I needed including checking in/out."
1256883,56343077,2015-12-12,50592678,Chad,"Beautiful home in a great neighborhood!   Home has everything you need furnished and is very clean.  The bedrooms are large, 3 beds and a cot.  Kitchen, dining room, and living room is an open floor plan... all very nice!  The neighborhood has the best parking, always a spot in front of or on side of house.  Walk to anything you want...  Neighborhood Lady and Two Doors Down ended up being our favorite.  Safeway is a few blocks away as well. Easy to get an Uber if want to go downtown.  Marshall was very accommodating and a pleasure doing business with.  I highly recommend the house and Marshall to anyone!"
1256883,57252405,2015-12-23,8093858,Liam,Marshall was great! Very communicative and available throughout the whole process. Never met him in person (which was preferred) but spoke over the phone and was very helpful about everything. Very nice guy.
1880734,9004626,2013-12-01,9559797,Olivia,"We rented this beautiful, historic home from Dan & Kris while we had family visiting for Thanksgiving weekend. They were very fair, friendly, accommodating and made the whole process easy and worry-free. Not only was the house spacious, comfy and clean, the location itself was perfect - plenty to see and do within a short walking distance in a quiet and scenic neighborhood! We would LOVE to stay there again when we have more visitors in town. "
1880734,9387043,2013-12-25,8160096,Marie,"Four of my friends stayed here and just loved everything about the house.  The beds were comfotable, the showers powerful and the living room was idyllic for chilling out after long dsys of exploring the city.  But, they loved the kitchen most of all as it had everything they needed to make delicous breakfasts.  Their only complaint was that they couldn't stay longer!  They also want me to give Kris and Dan a big thanks for making them so welcome and giving them some great suggestions for some cool bars in the area.  I'm so haapy that you made their stay in Seattle so much fun, so many thanks, Marie
"
1880734,9511863,2013-12-31,10469814,Rob,"This was our first time using airbnb and Daniel & Kris were great hosts!  They were flexible with our travel dates on short notice and were helpful with answering our questions about the area.  Their home was impeccably clean, the bedrooms are separated by a door, and we appreciated the two bathrooms!  We were also pleased with the parking situation - we were always able to get a spot right in front of the house.  We had a great stay in Capitol Hill!  Thank you!"
1880734,10548689,2014-02-24,2492181,Adam,Daniel was a great host. Very helpful orientation to the area. The place was perfect for us. I would definitely come back!
1880734,12289750,2014-04-28,6162739,Gary,"Mercerhouse was a great place to stay.  Easy access, parking and quiet.  It was clean and comfortable.  The host made sure that we had everything we needed."
1880734,12931619,2014-05-14,14644679,Christina,"The host, David and Kris are awesome!  The place was a home away from home so comfortable.  Location, location, location, located downtown.  My daughter graduated from Cornish college, we had to make trips back and forth and is was so convenient. 
We stayed as a family and it was nice not to have to stay in a hotel where we would all go into our rooms and not see each other we were able to play board games had some food and drink all in the same home, while on vacation.  Plenty of room for all of us ( 5 young adults and Mom)  not to mention all the friends that stopped by to visit for a bit.  I would stay again the home is so nice and clean and so."
1880734,14272134,2014-06-16,7321597,Phoebe,Lovely house. I had a great time there with my family. Quite neighbor and it is quite close to some local cafe and bars. Highly recommended!
1880734,14429531,2014-06-19,8823519,Gloria,"Daniel's house's location is very good, quiet but close to downtown. We all love this  place. The master bedroom is big and the bathroom is very lovely. Thank you Daniel."
1880734,14552913,2014-06-22,13639275,Jon,"Daniel's house is the perfect base for a visit to Seattle. Capitol Hill is a vibrant area with beautiful wooden houses (like Daniel's), leafy streets and parks (check out Volunteer Park on top of the hill) but close to edgy bars, independent shops and restaurants. We wanted to eat out gluten free and found Capitol Cider (an all gluten free kitchen) and Cafe Flora (50% gluten free options). Also good bus services to Downtown. A great place to stay in a great city! "
1880734,16292861,2014-07-25,10955600,Kate,It was a pleasant surprise finding a bottle of wine and we really appreciated our host's willingness to share tips for places to eat and visit it the city. 
1880734,17263336,2014-08-10,594400,David,Daniel and Kris were wonderful hosts and their house was very comfortable for us a family of four. They stayed in contact with us as we approached arrival time and gave us a warm welcome and showed us around their beautiful home in a quiet residential neighborhood of Seattle. The house is a short 10 minute drive from downtown and is nice to come back to the quiet of home after a busy day of sightseeing.  Our two teenage girls loved the house and having their own bedroom and the hippy international character of the home. We would highly recommend this home and these hosts to anyone who want a lot of space and an at-home feel away from home.
1880734,18534754,2014-08-28,10828326,Tanice,"This was everything we'd hoped for!  A beautiful home in a perfect location in Capitol Hill.  Dan and Kris met us at the house, they are wonderful and helpful and the whole experience could not have been better.  Thank you.
Clean, comfortable, easy- we wanted to move in!"
1880734,18798886,2014-09-01,1453829,Conrad,"We had a fantastic weekend at Kris and Dan's place, and we would recommend it to anyone at all. It was perfect: the hosts were helpful and friendly (and life very cool lives), the neighbourhood is amazing (easy access to transit, great restaurants minutes away, beautiful tree-lined streets), and the house is great.  We could not rate it more highly."
1880734,21142356,2014-10-12,4299927,Patricia,"I booked Dan & Kris' house for my family who came to Seattle to attend my wedding. They loved the place. It was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. They felt right at home at this house, which was great for my parents who traveled all the way from Indonesia. The neighbourhood was also very nice with a few must try restaurants a couple of blocks away, but quiet and safe. The heart of Capital Hill is within walking distance, and public transportation to major go to places such as down town, University district, and Ballard is just around the corner. 
Dan & Kris were nice and accommodating. My parents would definitely stay here again if they need accommodations on their next visit to Seattle.
"
1880734,34943716,2015-06-14,29511784,Casey,"We had a wonderful time staying in Dan & Kris' home. It was situated in the perfect neighborhood...quiet and tree-lined, yet walking distance to almost everything! The home was spacious enough for our group of 4 and we even enjoyed sitting on the back patio at night for some cocktails and games. Dan & Kris made us feel very welcome with a bottle of wine, local coffee, and a list of places to eat & check out during our trip. They also gave us many recommendations for local restaurants and places in the area, which made planning our trip that much easier. We had a great time in Seattle and hope to be back soon! "
1880734,35920667,2015-06-23,5444086,Megan,"Very welcoming - Dan walked us through the whole house, showing us all the features. They left coffee, wine, and even a few snacks in the refrigerator. Access was easy (key code) even though not everyone from the party was at the house at the same time. We live near by, and we will definitely keep this in mind for when we have too many houseguests for our place!"
1880734,37635232,2015-07-09,20670607,Nicola,Dan and Kris's place is well appointed and located in an attractive neighbourhood close to great restaurants and shops. The house is comfortable and spacious with lots of interesting art and artefacts from around the world. Dan and Kris were out of town when we stayed but made sure that a friend showed us around the house and that everything was in order for our visit. We really enjoyed our stay.
1880734,39739193,2015-07-26,30561081,Teresa,"We had a fantastic time ! Kris welcomed us with a tour of their lovely home. We loved its' down home feeling, the decor, the amenities and the comfortable beds. The neighborhood was Picturesque and home to many restaurants, a coffee shop and ice cream shop. Also close by is the Polish Cultural Center which serves authentic dinners every Friday and Sunday night ! Dan and Kris left a list of places to visit; local restaurants within walking distance along with attractions to see in Seattle. Should we come back to Seattle, this Airbnb is where I'd want to stay.
"
1880734,41200398,2015-08-05,13403719,Russell,"Great proximity to shops, walking distance from many wonderful bars and restaurants. Owners were very detailed in their description of each amenity while giving us the tour. House was well maintained, clean, and cozy. Host was accommodating by meeting us at the house on time. They also sat down with us for an additional hour to help us plan our hike and were knowledgeable about the area. It felt more like staying at a close friend's house than a rental. When the back patio is finished, it looks like it will be a very nice place to sit. "
1880734,42121786,2015-08-11,9562048,Marie,Thank you to Dan & Kris for an absolutely lovely stay in your home!  My sister and 2 friends were greeted for a tour and even a local bottle of wine.  We were in town for a wedding and the location is perfect for all the sights.  The home was very comfortable and lots of history!  There are 2 delicious restaurants 2 blocks away and a great coffee shop too!  We had a great time and would definitely stay again :)
3888986,41576826,2015-08-08,26518982,Yufeng,"This is really an amazing place to stay! I am really excited to meet lots of friends during my stay. Especially enjoyed talking about tech stuff with people who have different background. The house weekly party is also very very fun! I also gave a talk during my stay, which is really interesting. It's really a nice experience and I actually invite one of my friends to stay at the same place. Finally, I want to thank the house manager, Paul, who is a great and smart guy! Really enjoyed talking with you and your insightful opinion really impressed me! See you later, Paul! I highly recommend this place, especially people who like technology and willing to share you mind with others! This is definitely the best choice! 
"
3593582,35566937,2015-06-20,33160938,Chris & Michelle,"Tony was very communicative and helpful and responded quickly to our questions. He let us check in a little early which was huge for us and we really appreciate it.  We were in town to see our Giants play the Mariners and Tony was very helpful letting us know how to get around.

The beds were very comfortable. The town home is in a fantastic location, close to downtown and very quiet.  We didn't get to meet Tony as he was out of town. 
No complaints just a heads up this unit has a lot of stairs so older or folks that have difficulty with stairs may want to select a different unit. 
We had no issues with them but thought it would be good to mention this.  Also it was obvious that there was a little dog that lived there. We and our friends have pets so was not a problem but again some folk may have allergies.  The home was clean and had a lived in feel.  We appreciate Tony opening his home to us and would recommend this unit to others.  Also parking was easy and close. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and again appreciated the close proximity to Downtown Seattle. A very good value."
5633607,28289543,2015-03-21,29513338,Darnell,"Great central location in Capitol Hill.  Easy bus access and definitely walkable to lots of dining and activities.  The home itself is clean and tidy.  The room was perfectly furnished for me and the bedding quite comfortable.  Because the home is located in an urban area know that city sounds can be heard in the room.  With that said the building itself is quite peaceful and I felt safe and relaxed while there.

Joshua was very hospitable and welcoming.  It was great to chat with him about dining and activities in the area."
5633607,28502292,2015-03-24,10461840,Mohammed,"The place was exactly as pictured with great amenities and a great location in Seattle. It was so close to many attractions such as volunteers park and cemetery. Downtown Seattle was no too far too.  Joshua was prompt in communication and even with scheduling conflicts was able to work out key delivery without any awkward waiting. Would definitely stay again.
"
5633607,28632115,2015-03-27,8595802,Stephanie,"My stay in Capitol Hill exceeded my expectations! The apartment was incredibly clean, cozy, and had everything I needed. The bathroom was great, wi-fi was super fast, and the shower was hot with nice water pressure. I also loved that I was able to cook and use the kitchen to my liking! In addition to the impeccable accommodations, Josh was a terrific host! He was very easy-going,  personable and generous throughout my entire stay, and made me feel at home--You know what? Next time I am in Seattle I will definitely book here again! "
5633607,28830318,2015-03-30,4193512,Jake,Josh's place was very comfortable and the location was perfect. He was also a great host. Highly recommended.

5633607,30149470,2015-04-18,1941359,Ilja,"Very nice home. Spacious room and within easy reach of lots of bars and hipster places. However, the location is in a very quite neighborhood. I haven't met Josh in person but he organized everything perfectly and he let me even use his parking spot. I can recommend to everyone."
5633607,30618073,2015-04-25,9374262,Bobby,"Josh was a great host. Very friendly and hospitable. The apartment is really clean and in an ideal location close to just about everything. We were able to walk to downtown (20-30 min) and most bars/restaurants are nearby. Safeway grocery is about 3 blocks away. 

Overall a great experience that I would recommend to anyone. "
5633607,30807957,2015-04-27,30429931,Julia,"Amazing apartment, very nice host, and very good neighbourhood. Downtown less than 30 min walking. Joshua is an excellent host, he offers and give all you need.
"
5633607,31151175,2015-05-02,26739392,William,"This was the first time using bnb. We decided to visit Seattle very last minute, and Joshua accepted us one day before. Joshua was very nice host. He was waiting us exact time that we combined. He respected our privacy all the time. The room and washroom were clean. We didn't use the kitchen, but he offered to use kitchen and fireplace. This place is recommendable. "
5633607,31524992,2015-05-06,25436827,Jules,"Location was excellent, the appartment very comfortable and clean, and Joshua really nice :)"

I was right in the center of all I wanted to do, and couldn't believe how easy it was to navigate around the city with the apartment as my base.  Clean, stylish, and comfortable, this is a great option for anyone wanting to stay in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods.  Josh was a gracious and friendly host.  I would definitely stay here again!"
5633607,32198727,2015-05-15,29998720,Ian,"My stay in Seattle was great! Joshua was a really great host and was very welcoming and helpful. Apartment was clean and spacious. Walking distance from Capitol Hill and lots of coffee shops. He's a really cool person, sad we didn't get to hang out but before I departed we got to sit and talk a bit and it was cool. I recommend to stay here the room is pretty big and you get a full closet. I only stayed for 2 nights but if I'm ever in Seattle again I hope it's longer and would love to stay here again."
5633607,32361184,2015-05-17,27013066,Christin,Joshua was very nice and made us feel welcome!Perfect location!The apt was clean and as described - I would stay there again!
5633607,32521327,2015-05-19,4796930,Brooks,"Josh has a nice place in a great location. We stayed two nights, unfortunately the second night coincided with Josh having a number of friends over; they were loud and a bit rowdy which made us feel uncomfortable. "
5633607,32830718,2015-05-22,30161987,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay! The space was great - clean and comfortable. Josh is very friendly and did a good job communicating details around arrival/departure.

5633607,32985415,2015-05-24,20992381,Matt,"Highly recommend Joshua as a host. Very amicable and welcoming. Check in and check out were a breeze with great communication. Joshua did not hesitate to invite me along to his plans for the evening despite short notice, which was extremely gracious of him. I had a great time in Seattle. The neighbourhood is quiet, but very close to good coffee and nightlife, and Capitol Hill is only a short walk to downtown or even the Space Needle if need be. The Mystery Soda Machine is also only two blocks away--check it out. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable--no silly foam top, which I found refreshing. You can't go wrong with this place, it's got everything you need. Thanks for everything--I hope to be back some day soon!"
5633607,33267670,2015-05-26,1752262,Rachel,Josh was quick to respond to my reservation request and easy to communicate/coordinate with prior to my arrival. Check in/out was a breeze. The location is ideal as the neighborhood is walkable and has a variety of restaurants and bars nearby. Downtown is an easy 25 - 30 minute walk as well. Overall Josh is an incredibly friendly and considerate host. I highly recommend! 
5633607,33511067,2015-05-29,31141842,Benjamin,"I had never been to Seattle and wanted to stay in a great neighborhood, and Joshua's apartment was perfect. Clean, bright, and walking distance from great sights, bars, and restaurants. If I am ever back in Seattle, I will hopefully stay in this apartment again. "
5633607,34060248,2015-06-04,1968768,Carole,"This place was great! Joshua was welcoming and responsive. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, as was the rest of the apartment. The location absolutely can't be beat if you're looking to spend your time on Capitol Hill (but if you want a quiet neighborhood be warned that this is not it). I would definitely stay here again."
5633607,34800035,2015-06-12,15823359,Laurence,"I've been lucky and delighted with those I've AirBNB'd with and Joshua is no exception. He made was extremely accommodating with communication around arrival, the Apartment is a delightful mid-century building (which being a Mid Century junkie was a treat in itself, all the bright, natural light). 

The room is large, spacious and full of light, and Joshua is an amiable, considerate and humorous host down to have conversations with guests. It's always a pleasure to get to sit down and talk with your hosts and he was definitely a pleasure.

The location is super convienient to the core of Seattle (although I was breath taken by Capitol Hill, in a number of ways. People had told me Seattle was hilly, and being a Bay Area Native I thought nothing could be any worse than our 7 hills). 

Luckily the apartment is centrally located near Broadway and Pike/Pine and short cab/drive/public transit jaunts from Downtown, Seattle Center and Lake Union. But your glutes will definitely get a workout on uphill sections back to the apartment. 

Highly recommend staying with Joshua, the apartment and staying in Capitol Hill in general when staying in Seattle. Hopefully I'll get a chance to get back for a more extended stay."
5633607,35497169,2015-06-19,34378230,Bijou & Jamie,"Thank you for your hospitality, Josh! 
Josh was a great host and very welcoming. His apartment is just as shown on the photos, clean and spacious. Josh provided us with privacy, but also let us know he would be available if we had any questions. Overall, this was our first try with Airbnb and we'll definitely use it again as we had a positive experience. "
5633607,35686427,2015-06-21,6333173,Meghan,"Overall a wonderful experience! Josh was super friendly and quick to give local tips. The location of the apartment couldn't be beat, and it was incredibly spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend! "
5633607,36438679,2015-06-28,31322469,Kelly,"Joshua was a very welcoming host! He definitely made me feel at home the instant I walked into his apartment. The listing description is accurate and the apartment is very well maintained and very clean. The guest bedroom also has pamphlets of things to do in Seattle which was helpful when I was figuring out how to spend my free time. Joshua's apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill and I easily walked from the apartment to Pike Place Market, Pike Street shopping and restaurants, and nearby shops and dining. Staying at Joshua's was my first Airbnb experience and I will definitely consider airbnb for my future stays even outside of Seattle. "
5633607,36957495,2015-07-03,28775978,Christianna,Our host Josh was friendly. The place was just as pictured and in the fabulous Capitol Hill area of Seattle. We came and left at different times so that worked well. The shower was great and we had nice fresh towels.
5633607,37453888,2015-07-07,30814008,Sheila,"My husband and I stayed with Josh for a good friends wedding. Not only was Josh very welcoming he made us feel at ease instantly. This is  my second time using ABNB and my husbands first, having a host as well as Josh will be tuff to beat. We were so happy with our  experience we hope to stay with Josh again next time we're in the area! "
5633607,37883117,2015-07-11,34326101,Jingming,"I had a good experience staying at Joshua's place.  Clean room, convenient location, and friendly host."
5633607,38292779,2015-07-14,35230179,Patrick,Very comfortable. Great location 
5633607,39185017,2015-07-21,35710987,Eli,"Joshua was a fantastic host.  He worked around our schedule and created a very warm and welcoming environment for us during our stay.  We couldn't have been more thrilled with our experience.

Everything was as advertised.  The room was ready for us upon our arrival, with clean sheets and clean towels.  His apartment was very clean and in the perfect location for our first visit to Seattle. 

If you're making it out to Seattle, make sure you get in touch with Joshua!!"
5633607,39403559,2015-07-23,33031871,Nathan,"This place is in a wonderful location, just a short walk to some great restaurants and bars. The bed is comfortable and there is plenty of space. I didn't spend much time with Joshua but the conversations we did have proved to be very interesting. "
5633607,40205584,2015-07-29,31779609,Michelle,"Staying at Josh's was great, as himself personally. Clean and comfy and close enough to walk downtown and take in the sights. Great place and great host! Cheers :)"
5633607,40476797,2015-07-31,32518911,Porntira,I lived there for a couple days. It was great clean and tidy. I like capitol hill has many places that you can chill out in the night time. 
5633607,40760851,2015-08-02,34282090,Ana,"We enjoyed our stay at Joshua's. Place was just as listed. Joshua was an excellent host allowing us to use his apt as needed. He gave us privacy but was available if we needed anything. 

This is a prime location and I am glad we chose to stay in Capital Hill. Bus stop near by and easy to use. Would definitely choose this place or neighborhood again!"
5633607,41107045,2015-08-04,22732410,Gary,Josh was an amazing host! He was very accommodating and made sure we were not only comfortable but also enjoying our time in Seattle. I highly recommend staying with Josh especially if you've never been to Seattle before.
5633607,41370902,2015-08-07,35316620,Roni,"Josh was very welcoming, explaining all the house amenities to us and assisting us with any questions about the city and neighborhood. His house was very clean and the room provided a lot of space for storing luggage. Although the bathroom was small, it served all functions and allowed for a comfortable stay. "
5633607,41946330,2015-08-10,23429924,Henry,"Josh was very accommodating and patient in explaining everything about the house and the neighborhood.

The neighborhood is nice, you kinda feel secluded from the craziness of capitol hill but the main street is only a couple blocks away.

Pretty sure it was just because there was construction the time we were there. But it was kinda loud, with loud trucks driving by. But I didn't really mind it. "
5633607,42546967,2015-08-14,9542513,Mike,"Our USA trip started with an email from air bnb informing us that our Seattle booking was cancelled due to the apartment being sold. In a panic we searched air bnb and found Joshua’s apartment and glad we did. Joshua welcomed us when we arrived but unfortunately had to leave town during our stay. He was very amiable and gave us heaps of local information before he left. He left contact details and we were easily able to contact him during our stay.
The location is much better than the original Queen Anne booking, close to lots of eating options in the area and a short walk down the hill to downtown and the space needle. It is a safe area and also convenient to SeaTac airport taking the light rail to Westlake (email hidden) and a quick Uber ride (or 20 minute walk) to the apartment.
The room was large and comfortable as advertised and while there was a bit of street noise during the evening was very quiet throughout the night.
In all, our visit to Seattle was made pleasant by staying at Joshua’s apartment and we would recommend his place to other travellers.
"
5633607,43033520,2015-08-17,20183418,Jennfier,"Room was spacious and clean, Josh was a good host and had many suggestions for dining. Location was great and an easy walk to the bars and restaurants. Parking in the neighborhood is a little tight at times if you have a car, but manageable. The parking pass provided was great and necessary as you can't park on the streets more than a couple hours without one. "
5633607,43807059,2015-08-22,9427878,Jess,"The place was perfect. Central to everything, spacious and clean. Joshua was an excellent host. I would recommend him to anyone. "
5633607,44125562,2015-08-24,2403221,Alex,"Joshua was a great host! He was very accommodating and easy to get along with. He made special accommodations so I could use his parking pass (= free parking for me) even before his previous guests moved out which meant that he had to meet me twice that day. The apartment looks as good as on the pictures; spacious, clean, trendy. The bed is super comfortable and I had no problems sleeping. The location is FANTASTIC - you will have a hard time finding anything like this for this price so close to downtown and pike/pine area. It took me 20mins of normal-pace walk to get to Convention Center. The neighborhood is safe and just a few of blocks from vibrant pub/club/restaurant scene. Overall - great."
5633607,45611610,2015-09-04,31858723,Scott,"Josh was excellent with all of the communications.  He greeted us with a smile, showed us around and then we sat and chatted for about an hour. It was a good time.

The apartment is in a great location and we found parking to be very easy.

The room and apartment overall were neat, clean and organized.  The bed was comfortable and the temperature was good.

We would stay here again."
5633607,45822086,2015-09-06,40719128,Briana,Josh was (email hidden)ally friendly and gave us good advice about the city. The place was in the perfect location...walking distance or a quick uber to anywhere we wanted to go. 
5633607,46133379,2015-09-08,7074272,Mike,"Sadly our experience did not live up to the expectations we had after reading all of Josh’s positive reviews. We got off to a bit of a rough start. A few weeks before arrival, I told Josh we were targeting a 6-8pm arrival. He asked that we agree on a specific time, so we agreed on 8pm. That morning, he called and said he was out hiking for the day and was behind schedule due to traffic, so he might have trouble making 8pm. We agreed to play it by ear and grab a drink if Josh wasn’t back in Seattle by then. Right around 8pm, I got a message that said he won’t be back so “let’s just call it 10pm.” Being in an unfamiliar city with all of our luggage, this was not great for us. I asked if Josh knew anyone who could let us in the apartment so that we weren’t stranded for 2 hours and his response was simply “sorry for the inconvenience.” So we made the best of it and had dinner downtown, took an Uber to Capitol Hill, and grabbed a drink at one of the bars, still with all of our luggage. We still had time to kill so we decided to go to Josh’s place and wait outside so that we could get in as soon as possible. Once Josh arrived, things got a little awkward. He was clearly not prepared for our arrival and he showed up with 3 friends to help him get the place ready for us. We sat in the living room while he instructed his friends to make the bed and straighten up the bedroom. He did apologize and offered to buy us lunch the next day, which was a nice gesture that we appreciated. He then gave us the tour and made us feel welcomed, letting us know that we could use anything in the apartment that we wanted. 

Once we got past that, the experience didn’t really improve and it felt like living with a college roommate. While the apartment is organized, it is overall not a clean place. The shower had grout stains all over and strands of hair caked onto the sides of the tub. Whenever I walked around, I had little pieces of dirt stuck to the bottom of my feet. Our comforter was definitely not cleaned since the prior guests. The apartment is old, so be prepared for noise both inside and out. This includes at 1am of BOTH nights of our stay, when Josh got home and decided to cook something (bacon I think?). We were woken up by the sounds of him stomping around and banging pots together. Every floorboard and door creaks, so it is not great unless you’re a heavy sleeper. 

Josh is an overall friendly guy and can give good Seattle recommendations, but I didn't consider him to be a great host given our experience. I wouldn't recommend this apartment although definitely recommend Capitol Hill. 
"
5633607,46416290,2015-09-10,3935720,Paul,"I had an excellent experience all around. The location was fantastic, the apartment was nice, and the bedroom was spacious. Joshua was a great host. He made me feel welcome and provided recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle but not wanting to spend a fortune on accommodations."

5633607,47053153,2015-09-15,32542872,Stefanie,"Joshua was a great host!  The room is large and was great for us during our visit.  Joshua's apartment is in an excellent location, everything was very walkable.  He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and give us ideas of places to visit while we were in town.  We had a great time in Seattle and Joshua was a big part of that!  I would definitely stay with him again."
5633607,47497277,2015-09-19,27000545,Ruth,Joshua was very welcoming on arrival and made me a drink. Apartment had everything I needed including soft towels and a decent shower. The room was spacious with a good working area and wifi- a little cool though in the room at times. Was within walking distance of downtown Seattle and the wonderful central coop (organic). Enjoyed my stay and host was very friendly and knowledgable about the area. 
5633607,48296787,2015-09-25,41838098,Alex,"The place was perfect, as advertised! 

Both location and connection are very good and the apartment/room itself left nothing to be desired. It was spacious, light, neat and clean.

Getting/leaving keys was no trouble at all, even though we missed the original appointment by quite a margin which was a mistake on our part.
The host was very friendly and welcoming. He showed us around the neighborhood and took us to a place we ended up loving. Nothing about the interaction felt tedious or forced."
5633607,48876260,2015-09-29,6604490,Caroline,Good location for our first Seattle experience!
5633607,49470985,2015-10-04,38375226,杜,Joshua is very nice and helpful. The room is clean and close to downtown. I would highly recommend it.
5633607,50076994,2015-10-09,35674689,Lawrence,"Josh was a very welcoming host and I loved his apartment.  It is located in a prime area of Capitol Hill, with easy access to the best of the neighborhood.  The bedroom was large and comfortable and the rest of the apartment was spacious.  Josh was always willing to offer any help and I enjoyed talking to him.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and Josh made it a fine one."
5633607,50473872,2015-10-12,4204759,Leo,"Josh was a great host. Knowledgable - sharing tips on restaurants and tours. He even got a fire going in the fireplace on our last night.  The room is spacious and the apartment located in a centrally located part of the city near a supermarket and even an urgent care center, with easy access to everything you need. This made our few days in Seattle a lot easier to navigate. Thanks Josh"
5633607,50785605,2015-10-14,5469588,Claudia,"Perfect host, prime location. Josh was a breeze to communicate with & let me drop my bags off before he got the place ready from the guests the night before so that I could hit the ground running. The apt is clean, comfy, and located near everywhere you want to be in Capitol Hill and easily to the city center in no time at all! "
5633607,51536346,2015-10-21,42489719,Madison,"We loved our stay at Joshua's place, it was not only in a great location but it was clean and well kept. For two young college students, it is the perfect place to hang out for a few days,  the neighborhood is ideal for going out on a Saturday night and eating some yummy food. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Seattle in the near future. "
5633607,51757568,2015-10-24,11052438,Jie,"Joshua was very friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic, would stay here again."
5633607,52317886,2015-10-28,24133180,Emma,"The apartment is located very centrally to some great bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. Seattle CBD is within walking distance as well. The room is spacious and private. Josh was a great host, very informative and approachable."

5633607,55030147,2015-11-27,9583989,Tomo,"Joshua was an incredibly gracious host. He was always responsive in our communication and was kind enough to allow us to drop our stuff well before check in time. His room was tidy and clean, and he ensured we were comfortable throughout our stay. He invited us out to a local jazz night but unfortunately we did not make it out. 

The location of his home is fantastic. It is within walking distance of very fun places in Capital Hill, such as a nice beer bar, a Greek restaurant, and a great Japanese restaurant called Momiji. We would definitely like to come back again. Thank you Joshua! "
5633607,55796982,2015-12-06,47059994,Elizabeth,"Joshua was great! Right off the bat he gave us a list of ideas and restaurants in the area, a quick tour of the place, and made us feel very welcome. The pictures are exactly what we walked into and the place was clean. Location is awesome! We were able to walk everywhere because of how central it was. Joshua made my first airbnb experience easy. Thank you!"
5633607,56202895,2015-12-10,5137769,Carlene,This place is in a great location. It's roomy and clean. Loved our stay. 
5633607,56321026,2015-12-12,19869120,Danielle,Joshua was super friendly and welcoming - greatest host introduction of all time. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay and provided several spot-on recommendations for things to see and do. His place is just as described: bright and spacious. The location is ideal. The best Seattle spots are just around the corner and it's easy to get to when driving into the city. I would highly recommend staying here.
5633607,56661590,2015-12-16,44046458,Carol,Josh was an amazing host for my boyfriend and I. Right off the bat he gave us a quick tour of the place. Everything that was described and seen in pictures was exactly what it was. He also provided us with some suggestions on what to do and where to eat. We had similar interests so we ended up hanging out one of the nights during our stay and had many interactions in between. I would definitely stay with Josh again! 
2612025,11875991,2014-04-17,14119023,Katja,Celine and Kurt made me feel welcome in their lovely home and Columbia City was a pleasant surprise. 
2612025,12306366,2014-04-28,14206888,Matthew,"Celine and Kurt were great hosts. The room/house was perfect for my needs, quite and access to a nice kitchen. The house is located very close to the bus line and is incredibly convenient for getting downtown. I would definitely recommend this room.  "
2612025,12964044,2014-05-15,15286084,Lorenzo,"Céline and Kurt are both charming nice people and superb hosts! They were quick to give me a tour and let me know details of the house which I appreciated. They were courteous to my needs and even went out of their way to make me feel more comfortable. For a Seattle implant like myself, they were more than happy to give advice and directions. Their home is fun, charming, and all around lovely. Thanks for making my first week in the city a great experience! "
2612025,13226925,2014-05-22,11888079,Annet,"Céline and Kurt are great hosts, I enjoyed my stay at their house very much, it was very relaxing. Céline and Kurt are very open, helpful and interested. Their carefulness is also reflected in their house, which is adorable and furnished with a lot of love for details. "
2612025,13485776,2014-05-28,12683569,Ziwei,"cline is very nice! Cline's house is close to the bus station. We really like the house's style. If you go to the restroom at night, be careful not to step on a lovely cat^_^
"
2612025,13797475,2014-06-04,15615252,Trenton,"Celine and her husband are very good hosts. They keep thinking for their guests. Although it is just a little hot in the top floor, they set up an air conditioner for me. They made me at home and shared their interesting stories. The room is quiet and very clean. I wish I could stay longer with them. Overall, I highly recommend their lovely and cute home."
2612025,14304355,2014-06-16,6495643,Chris,"This is a wonderful place to stay. Celine and Kurt are great hosts. The neighborhood is a bit of a labyrinth, but a unique part of Seattle we would have never seen otherwise. And everyone who stays here should definitely check out nearby Georgetown, which is a real hidden gem.

The beds in this room are really comfortable. We loved the decor (the whole house is great). The shower was amazing. Plenty of easy parking. And the drive to downtown Seattle is really simple (time totally depends on the craziness of Seattle traffic).

I absolutely recommend staying here. I would definitely stay again."
2612025,14558957,2014-06-22,14820598,Grant,"I visited Seattle to attend a friend's wedding and just needed a place to sleep at night. Céline and Kurt's house is truly wonderful and was perfectly located for my purposes of being in Beacon Hill and Georgetown for most of my trip. Very consistent decorating and a comfortable space; the upstairs gets a little hot at times, but a fan was provided and, with the window open at night, it was no problem at all. I wasn't around the house very often, but my few interactions with the hosts were very pleasant and they made me feel welcomed. They also leave out a handful of useful guide books for Seattle to get some ideas of places to visit in your spare time.

I'd definitely recommend this space to anyone looking for a comfortable and conveniently-located place to stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is a little tricky to navigate the first couple times driving there, but once you figure it out it's a great respite from the pace of the rest of the city."
2612025,15238539,2014-07-05,5200270,Brielle,"This was the most charming and adorable room and home that I have ever stayed in. The beds were so comfy and so so cute. Celine is wonderful and gave lots of tips for our trip. There is plenty of street parking. The bus stop is a 2 minute walk away and goes right to downtown Seattle, a much better way to get around than driving in dt Seattle. I would stay here in a heartbeat again!!"
2612025,15381909,2014-07-07,17619918,Tom,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Celine's adorable home! The room was spacious and tastefully decorated and the beds were very comfortable. It is only a quick drive or light rail ride (we did both) to downtown Seattle. Everything was very clean and Celine was a courteous host, going out of her way to help us find transportation to downtown despite all the bus closures on the 4th of July. Would absolutely stay at her home again."
2612025,15513978,2014-07-10,16976357,Peter,"Cèline and Kurt were kind and engaging hosts. I broke my eye glasses before arrival in Seattle and they gave my daughter and I a lift to Costco to find another pair. 

They gave clear and precise directions downtown and about, and were easy to communicate with being home in the evening when we were there.  They also have a delightful house cat.

The house is a pretty little period home and the room was an attic room with a period feel also and two single beds. It was a little hot but an ooen window sorted that with a gentle evening breeze which made it comfortable at night to sleep.

My daughter and I enjoyed our stay."
2612025,15916401,2014-07-18,6410534,Stephanie,"Celine and Kurt were great hosts. They were very flexible, even with some changes in arrival time, and were attentive to our needs. The room was just the right size and the location was central for all the activities that my friend and I had planned during our stay. 

I would definitely recommend staying at Celine's if you're visiting Seattle!"
2612025,16111922,2014-07-22,12732427,Anne,We enjoyed our visit. The hosts were friendly and generous. The sheets were clean and the house was well decorated and fun! The bathroom is on the first floor and our rented room was upstairs. There is a bus line less than a 5 min walk from the house. The hosts provide books and brochures on Seattle to read during our visit which I appreciated. Overall this was a nice place to stay during our trip.
2612025,16382459,2014-07-26,11867895,Frederike,"Very cute house, lovely guestroom and very nice hosts. The location is very convenient: super short drive into town, free parking, close to bus and train. We had a great stay. Thank you very much."
2612025,16446797,2014-07-27,2369041,Bob,"Everything was perfect, Celine and her husband were very accommodating, especially with my last minute request. I only wish I had more time to spend at the house and in the room..."
2612025,16564940,2014-07-29,17290008,Nicole,We had such a good experience. The host made us feel welcome and made us feel at home. The house was charming and very comfortable. Great comfy beds too!   We hit a warm spell in Seattle while we were there and since we were upstairs in a house with no AC it was a bit warm during the day bit with the windows open at night it cooled off and made for some of the best sleep in a long time. 
2612025,16749404,2014-08-01,18840523,Grace,"Celine was a wonderful host. The house was amazing and fully decorated in vintage style right down to the last detail. I didn't get to chat to the hosts too much as I was only staying for two nights and wasn't home until late. I used Uber to get around but there is a bus stop to
Downtown only 5 minutes away. The beds are super comfy, there was a fan in the room incase it got too hot and the hosts were very accommodating. Highly recommended. I loved staying there. "
2612025,17319886,2014-08-10,19429213,Seong Min,"It was my first place staying, first time in USA,and first try for airbnb.
They comforted me a lot and set everything nicely, nice room on second floor, sweet bed, clean toilet, couch... everything was good!
Only one thing you should know is no market around this area. You may buy some food in market other place and bring to home!
Thank you for everything my friend celine! Wish you to happy every minute and every hour and hope to see you again"
2612025,17588592,2014-08-14,19206562,Amy,Such a cute room with comfy beds.  Very close and easy to go to and from downtown.  Very reasonable price.
2612025,17718067,2014-08-16,19602469,Barbara,celine and kurt did make us feel welcome and attended to our check-in needs. we were very pleased with our stay. excellent location with access to the areas we needed. a very sweet home and hosts.
2612025,17801144,2014-08-17,19660399,Peter,"Hosts were awesome, only stayed 1 night but the place was exactly as described. There's a bus stop 1 minute walk away that takes you downtown in ~10 mins depending on traffic. "
2612025,18035605,2014-08-20,19439500,Mamiho,"I had a good time in here!
Celine and her husband are very nice and the room was very cute.they told me the place that they recommend to go! So i could spent a good day :-)
Cat is verrrrry cute . I have never met such a cute cat.
You can go downtown by bus. To the bus stop you can walk and it takes only 5minutes or more short!
Thanx for everything.

ダウンタウンからもバスで一本。
部屋も広くて快適です！
ホストの二人はとっても親切で明るくて協力的。おすすめの場所を教えてくれます♪
猫ちゃんはとっても人懐っこくて
猫が苦手な私でも平気でした！
自分からすりよってきますよ笑
バスはいくら乗り継いでも同じ値段だし、この値段でこの位置に泊まれるならいいかなと思います！"
2612025,18287476,2014-08-24,20244075,Kerstin,This couple was lovely. Very nice and informative in helping us navigate Seattle. The bathroom is down a steep set of stairs but otherwise no complaints. They were polite and accommodating.
2612025,19174282,2014-09-07,3978363,Sarah,The house and room is so much more charming than the photos!!!  I had a great stay. The only thing is that it is a 15-20 min walk from anything. If that doesn't bother you it's an awesome place with very welcoming hosts!!!
2612025,19399784,2014-09-11,17863378,Manuela,"Wir wurden herzlich von Céline und Kurt empfangen. Da man zusammen im Haus wohnte war ein enger Kontakt jederzeit möglich. Egal ob man seine Ruhe brauchte von einem erlebnisreichen Tag oder etwas Austausch mit dem Gastgebern suchte, es gab nie ein Problem damit. Es war ein schöner Aufenthalt dort und ein wirklich schönes zu Hause! :-)"
2612025,19718113,2014-09-16,585305,Wayne,The room was upstairs in a quaint older house they are remodeling.  Celine and Kurt were very welcoming and pleasant.  Everything was clean. I would have no trouble staying there again.
2612025,20146583,2014-09-24,17591524,Masato,"不安の中、お家に伺ったが、とても優しく迎えてくれて嬉しかった。二人の暖かかい心遣いが旅の不安を払拭してくれた。
部屋はとても片付いていて、キレイだし、寝心地もばっちりであった。毎日遅く帰宅し、寝るためだけであったが、快適な1週間だった。"
2612025,20316134,2014-09-27,19185865,Daniel,"Celine and her husband were great and very accomodating. I stayed with them for three nights for some job interviews downtown and didn't have any problems. In fact, I rarely saw them. My flight was delayed so her husband stayed up to let me in. Their home was just down the street from a frequent bus route that went straight downtown. The room is actually really nice, though just be warned it's even more pink and frilly than it looks in the pictures! Also make sure to say hi to their beautiful and friendly cat!"
2612025,20572742,2014-10-01,13142037,Alison,"Celine was accommodating and polite.  The house is cute, clean and vintage 50's style to the smallest detail.  We were on foot, so it was a little bit out of the way, but not terribly so.  Celine and her husband gave us a great recommendation to visit Georgetown, although It would have been best to cab back after our dinner - the walk was quite long and uphill for night time.  To be fair, we were warned!  "
2612025,20801485,2014-10-05,1134900,Greta,"I had a great stay here and what a beautiful furnished house. It looks awesome!! Celine and her husband are so nice, helpful and always open. I highly recommend this place."
2612025,20979074,2014-10-08,21856401,Liz,"Celine's home is well presented and the room itself is charming - clean, spacious and v comfortable. It is v easy to get to downtown via bus and to connect with the airport train plus Celine provides plenty of visitor info. On the downside while the welcome was friendly Celine seemed intent on ignoring me after that. It was disconcerting and I felt a little awkward in the house. Her husband and room mate are friendlier. 

Would I recommend this place? I've had more enjoyable and fun airbnb experiences but it's clean, comfortable and safe so it depends what you're looking for."
2612025,21117137,2014-10-11,22263867,Christy,My friend Susan & I stayed at Celine's for just one night - and it was lovely.  The home's immaculate and sweetly decorated.  The beds were super comfy - we both slept extremely well.  Celine and her husband went out of their way to make us feel welcomed - they even found some 70's rock n' roll from their extensive music collection when we mentioned we liked it.  Would definitely recommend staying at this Airbnb.
2612025,22286220,2014-11-02,3135730,Amber&Justin,I must say I was too quickly trying to book and airbnb for a run up to Seattle for work. I confused Celine and her husband because I didn't tell her my husband and 3 year old were coming with me. What a surprise! Annelise is a really well behaved 3 year old so I get to take her places most 3 year olds don't get to go. It didn't go over very well and I think they felt very nervous about us staying. The house is very cute and I liked it a lot. I love to stay in fun places. The room was very cold and the heat didn't reach the top floor where we were. No heat was ran through the nigh. The beds were comfy.
2612025,23002064,2014-11-19,23562187,Romal,It was great night there
2612025,23805198,2014-12-10,1879072,Julie,"Really cute place as described and seen in the pics :) 
Celine and Duke are awesome hosts they welcomed us really well everything was great.
The bus going to downtown is 5 min away from the place and really really convenient.
I will definitely go back again. "
2612025,23842348,2014-12-12,6264287,Barbara,"What a delightful stay!  My sister had never been to Seattle, so for her birthday, we drove up from Portland for an overnight trip.  Celine and Kurt were warm and responsive with advice for our tourist questions, suggestions for restaurants, public transportation options, and driving directions.  Their cat, Domino, made sure we felt welcome as well, allowing my sister her cat fix while her own cats were back home in Sacramento.  The room was comfortable, warm and cozy, and charming in its décor.  All in all, worth a return visit in future for sure.  Thanks, Celine and Kurt!"
2612025,23934277,2014-12-14,11379539,Davis,"The room and accommodations were just as expected, and Celine was quite helpful during our arrival! The location was great - we especially enjoyed hanging out in Georgetown. Their cat was also very fun and sociable! Would definitely stay here again. "
2612025,24317959,2014-12-25,16904845,Fei,"The house is very lovely and clean, and the host is polite and friendly. "
2612025,24624609,2014-12-31,25177359,Chengcheng,非常温馨的房子，我们房间是在楼上的，很可爱。晚上有时候会断电，可能是用暖气的原因，但是没关系，Celine和她的丈夫已经解决了，并且帮助我们很多，非常感谢。
2612025,25252126,2015-01-10,24632862,Gloria,Very cute room and friendly host. Thanks to Celine!
2612025,25334415,2015-01-12,11548526,Heather,"Cute home as listed.  Friendly hosts and cat.  Clean bed and bathroom are what I am looking for.  Celine accommodated with requests like putting food in her already full fridge and space for putting my own toiletry.  Only thing to note for guest is as the room is an attic, the ceiling is a bit low for a tall person and is colder (but there is a portable heater to make it warmer in a few minutes). Also the bathroom is not too convenient as it is downstairs and has to be shared by 5 (including us two guests) .  Overall experience is good, it is an impressive  and unique place to stay."
2612025,25570904,2015-01-19,25844273,Yifan,"This is the first time I use airbnb, and I feel so lucky I chose Celine's cute house. The room is really clean and pretty, and they also have a cute cat. Although it was cold in Seattle during the weekend, they prepared us with a heater. Also, there is a bus stop 5 minutes away, so it's convenient to get to the downtown. If anyone wants to enjoy a short weekend in Seattle, I would really recommend this pretty house."
2612025,25762844,2015-01-25,3975422,James,"Really enjoyed Kurt and Celine's hospitality.  The neighborhood was quiet, close to downtown, and I slept great :-).  A friend and I came to Seattle for an opera so this was a great overnight option for us."
2612025,26080831,2015-02-02,26657825,윰,"it is as exactly same as it is shown on airbnb site. In terms of cleanness, it was perfect! Celine and her husband are also nice! If I have a chance to travel Seattle again, I would stay in her house again.  "
2612025,28212549,2015-03-20,18629127,Julia,Nice and clean! I love all the decorations Celine made!
2612025,28765831,2015-03-29,30005287,Andrea,"Delightful experience in this lovely home! If you like a cozy bedroom with a TV, sitting area and good sized closet SUPER close to downtown, this is a great spot.  Additionally, having the bus two blocks away to anywhere is a huge plus! Beautifully renovated, this home is charming and very comfortable.  Claw foot tub, and plenty of hot water, too! Easy stamp of approval on these hosts and their home.  I highly recommend both...but don't get attached to the precious kitty, Domino, and expect to take him with you...he loves it there too!  Thank Celene for a perfect first AIRBNB experience!

"
2612025,30467300,2015-04-22,9060931,Eber,"Céline and Kurt were excellent guests. They were always kind and available to answer any question. They gave me a lot of tips for my trip  and a result the experience was extraordinary. The place was clean, quiet and cozy. Loved the cat!

It was really easy to get to the house. From the airport, to the downtown and even the Museum of Flight. 

Highly recommended! "
2612025,31247329,2015-05-03,31763083,Lujia,"I love the house, and the host are very nice! "
2612025,31765211,2015-05-10,8284715,Jen,Very clean and tidy. Great location just south of downtown off of I-5. Highly recommended!
2612025,32866330,2015-05-22,28197930,Logan,"First off, this house is ADORABLE! We loved the decorating that Céline had going on. She was very hospitable and made sure that we had everything we needed, while giving us plenty of space. The house is also IMMACULATE. With easy public transportation two blocks away and being in a nice area of Seattle, you can't go wrong staying here. Thanks for an easy and pleasant stay!"
2612025,33547690,2015-05-29,34011252,Azza,Celine and Kurt were amazing. It was our first Airbnb experience and they were very warm and welcoming hosts. The house was very clean and tidy. Celine gave us good ideas of places to check out in her city and had great city information brochures in the room. Said hello every day we saw them and asked us how our day was. Great personal touches which made the stay great :) 
2612025,33971012,2015-06-02,30125332,Lanyu,"They are great hosts and the house is really cute, clean and cozy. They gave us warm greetings and helpful tips. It's convenient to go to downtown. We enjoyed the journey in Seattle! Thx~"
2612025,34256885,2015-06-06,34780567,Xunyi,"Celine's house is very lovely, their refrigerator is the cutest I've ever seen. Too bad we didn't have time play the star wars board game. I'll recommend their home to my friends."
2612025,34496853,2015-06-08,34536873,Chelsey,This was my first air b&b and they set the standard pretty high. They were very accommodating and friendly. A few general rules that she lists on her page but nothing hard to follow. They have the cutest house and decor. Not in the central area of Seattle tourists areas but it was a safe neighborhood. Bus was an option but we decided to use Uber which was a $13 fare. Still convenient and fun. Would highly recommend!
2612025,34835966,2015-06-12,20119900,Catherine,Very nice couple and super clean house
2612025,35211115,2015-06-16,29791047,Shiyue," Celine and her husband were so nice! It was our first experience in airbnb and they were welcoming hosts. We had really good time in Seattle, by the way the house is super clean and warm. Highly recommended!"
2612025,35505011,2015-06-19,35302493,Yulin,"Celine was a very nice host - friendly and easygoing. The house was a little bit older than we thought. However, it has everything mentioned in the listing. The neighborhood was pretty quiet and parking on street  was a walk in the park."
2612025,35701283,2015-06-21,32017933,Christopher,Description perfectly describes the experience at Céline's home. Neighborhood is quiet and a short walk to Georgetown. Cozy and comfortable room made it a very enjoyable trip. 
2612025,36046146,2015-06-24,35001834,Sarah,"This was my first experience using airbnb and it was a great one! Celine was a gracious host who made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. My brother and I both appreciated how clean the house was and how nice Celine, her husband, and their roommate were! I will definitely be using airbnb again in the future thanks to this great first-time experience. "
2612025,36432575,2015-06-28,8248731,Petra,You can feel and see the love that Celine and her husband put into their house. Very cute and comfortable. Everything was perfectly clean. And the bus ride to downtown was very easy. I had a great time.
2612025,37092446,2015-07-04,35782149,Surbhi,"Celine set very high expectation for my first Airbnb experience. She was there whenever I had any question. Both of them were there to greet me when I came in even though I came at around 10 pm in the night. She also made sure that I am comfortable in the room when I moved in. I had a good stay. Only thing is that you have to lift your luggage to the first floor, so make sure your luggage is not that heavy. "
2612025,38436888,2015-07-15,34922986,Aaron,"Célines place was very comfortable and as pictured/described. The room we was actually bigger than than I thought it would be and the beds were really comfortable. Céline and Kurt were also extremely friendly and helpful, and they had loads of cool suggestions for us of things to do in the city."
2612025,39327125,2015-07-22,37908759,Norma Nohemi,"Celine and Kurt were excellent hosts, they have a lovely home located just a couple blocks from a bus station. The neighborhood seemed safe and their neighbors were very nice. The house is extremely clean, our stay was wonderful. "
2612025,39785253,2015-07-26,35968321,Ellen,"Although we arrived very late the first night (GPS in our rental car was not working) and Celines' husband was in bed, he was very cordial and welcoming and helped us get settled. The house is just as cute as in the photos and very clean. The cat is adorable and friendly.  

One thing to note for future guests:  there is only one bathroom downstairs for the three residents and guests. That made five of us using it.  "
2612025,40385278,2015-07-30,39078443,Christina,This house was exactly as it is pictured.  It was very cute and clean.  The hosts were very friendly and accommodating.  Celine had a lot of local tourist information and even a cute little box of walking tours of Seattle. We were very busy and were not able to see them but we greatly enjoyed staying there.  It was a very quiet and comfortable.  One advantage was how close it was to downtown Seattle.  I would stay there again.  The only downside to this place was that it would not be as kid friendly.  It was fine for my 16 year old but I would not stay with my 7 year old son.  Too many beautiful things to break.  Thank you for letting us stay at your home. 
2612025,40607287,2015-08-01,36050905,王,"celine is very nice and her husband is quite strong that helped picking all the luggage up and down.
they are both really nice and its really a good place to stay in.
hope see them again in seattle!"
2612025,41235723,2015-08-05,37598212,Emma,"This was the perfect place for me and my boyfriend to stay in for our trip to Seattle. It's very close to the bus goes to the light rail (which goes downtown), or if you'd rather stay on the bus, it goes right down by Pike Place as well. The room was lovely and comfortable, and the house is spotless. Thank you so much, Céline, for your great hospitality!"
2612025,41953061,2015-08-10,35103883,Jasmine,"Our hosts Celine and Kurt went above and beyond to make us feel welcome in their home. From the friendly greeting on arrival and assistance with our luggage upstairs they exceeded all expectations. 

They supplied us with an abundance of information about Seattle not only verbally, but there were even folders and books placed upstairs on the bedside table filled with information for tourists about what to do in the city. 

We also enjoyed the tea, wifi, outside area and the overall decor of the home. The home was pristine, doll like and had adorable furnishings, colouring and decorations. We thought the house was so cute and shows a that the owners take a lot of pride and put a lot of effort and detail into the presentation and cleaningful of their home. "
2612025,42587745,2015-08-14,39757799,Priscilla,"Beautiful and safe room to stay. Celine and his husband are nice and welcoming.

2612025,43404806,2015-08-19,39398885,Natalie,"Celine was an excellent host. She gave us a lot of tips for traveling around Seattle. If you have time, try to read over her guide books in the room, it really helps smart traveling Seattle. Her house is very vintage cute and she has the cutest cat, Domino. So any cat lover (or not) will definitely enjoy the stay at the house. All the essentials, such as towels, shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided. I have to emphasize that the house is very very clean. Although my friend and I shared bathroom with Céline, her husband and her roommate, we never have a time collision with each other. They went out to work very early and we came back around 9 everyday. The room is spacious. The house is very close to the 36 bus stop, which goes straight to downtown Seattle(like space needle, pike street market for max 20 mins) and can transfer to LINK to the airport, very convenient. Keep in mind that we went during August, which suppose to be the hottest of year in Seattle. There is a fan in the room and it is perfectly fine for the warm weather. Céline said she could provide us ac, but we never feel like needing it. (Coming from a San Franciscan perspective) Very safe, quiet and friendly neighborhood. Overall my friend and I are very pleased with the stay and definitely enjoyed the whole trip."
2612025,44574270,2015-08-27,39017197,迪鸥,"Celine is definitely a great house owner! Her house is pretty and comfortable,especially the soft bed. And she is very warm hearted. Because of the flight,I arrived late.Celine waited me for over two hours and extended a warm welcome to me.She makes me feel at (website hidden) is first time for me to use airbnb ,I feel so lucky to have such wonderful experience!

2612025,47111455,2015-09-15,7975048,Darlene,"Celine and Kurt have a darling home and an accompanying precocious cat named Domino. When I was looking for a place to stay in the Seattle area with my daughter their listing stood out to me. The reviews were very good and it sounded perfect. Being hosts ourselves we perhaps have higher expectations and would have done some things differently but the home was clean, the beds were comfortable and although there is only one bathroom for several people it worked out ok and we enjoyed our time in the city.

2612025,48553678,2015-09-27,38818871,Emmy,"This is my first airbnb and Celine and his husband was very nice, everything is perfect that I think is gorgeous！房子离机场和市区都很近且方便，Celine很详细地告诉我们如何从机场到她家，也说了分享了很多建议给我们，还与我们共享了piza，真的非常好人！"

2612025,51320033,2015-10-19,11704471,Desiree,Céline has the most beautiful home I've ever seen. She should make a career of it. Her and her husband were so welcoming and warm and we really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our visit to Seattle.
2612025,55234143,2015-11-29,42194869,Allison,Celine is the sweetest and the cutest person. Her house was exactly like the description but only cuter. The bus stop was minutes away and it took about 15 minutes to get to downtown Seattle. The room we stay in was very comfortable and cozy. Every corner in the house was spotless. I couldn't ask for more! I would definitely recommend stay with Celine when visiting in Seattle and I would stay with her again if I go back! 
2612025,56341093,2015-12-12,50315188,Kevin,Celine was very welcoming even though my son and I arrived late due to a landslide on our drive into Seattle.    Didn't see much of her or Kurt just because our schedules not meshing.  We did have a short chat shortly before we left on Saturday morning.  Domino definitely enjoys any attention you give her.
2612025,56802976,2015-12-18,26389820,Lydia,Celine's home is very much like its photos. Very nice host and made us feel welcome!

6990477,37238032,2015-07-05,36747789,Kyle,Great place to stay in Downtown Seattle. The pictures are not misleading in any way. Very clean and comfortable. Eve was always responsive to my questions and concerns. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice flat in downtown Seattle.
6990477,37789421,2015-07-10,22127752,Jason,The unit was super clean and in a great (email hidden) close to everything.  Eve quickly answered all of our concerns and she even met us at the beginning of our trip with a bottle of wine!  All around great time.  The stay was awesome and Eve was awesome.  Eve definitely deserves her status as a Superhost! 
6990477,38030248,2015-07-12,13618106,Bridget,"This was the perfect place for our two night stay in Seattle. It had all the luxuries of a hotel with the price. The photos are 100% accurate; the apartment is spotless and everything was beautiful. The location alone made the place the right choice- it's close to a bunch of restaurants, a grocery store, and pretty much every Seattle tourist attraction you'd want to visit. Eve & Michael are awesome hosts, and I definitely recommend staying at this lovely property."
6990477,38453601,2015-07-15,648050,Renato,"Eve was a great host with a great place to stay.  Very central and easy to walk to everything.  Great restaurants, bars, and Whole Foods!  I was staying in Seattle for work and couldn't find a hotel room for a couple of days.  I was staying at the Westin downtown and briefly stayed at this property from Eve where I can say that I wish I could have stayed there longer rather than going back to a hotel like the Westin (which is great, but Eve's place was way better!)"
6990477,38641725,2015-07-17,37231771,Ryan,"This apartment was in a wonderful location and, as the description points out, an easy walk to Pikes Market and the Space Needle.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Eve was very responsive to my texts and made the process run very smoothly.  

The neighborhood is nice and no worries about walking around late at night.  A Whole foods market is right across the street.  The Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria above Whole Foods was fabulous.  The Flying Fish restaurant a couple of blocks to the north of the apartment was also great.  Make sure to stop at Top Pot donuts on the walk to Pike's Market. 

There is a parking spot under the apartment building with some public parking.  It wasn't extremely clear as to when to feed the meter.  I probably ended up paying when I really didn't have to but I didn't want to get towed.  "
6990477,38891787,2015-07-19,23186726,Jae,"Eve was a great host and the place was as advertised. Very modern space with a comfortable bed, with all the amenities.  The view from the rooftop of the Space Needle especially at sunset was beautiful and every major tourist spot was within easy walking distance (although the weather was so hot, we opted to drive most of the time).  We were having some issues with the internet connection, but Eve made every effort to fix it.  I can't blame her for it because I've had my own issues with Comcast at my home, but that was really the only even marginally negative thing I can say about our experience staying with Eve.  Would definitely rent a space from her again!"
6990477,39443427,2015-07-23,4031,Peggy,"Eve was quick to reply on all communications. The apartment was just as described; clean, tastefully decorated, comfortable bed and a surprise welcome gift. The location is perfect; walking distance to downtown & the Needle, Whole Foods across the street, Westlake trolley is half a block away and Union Lake is right down the road.
We found the top floor has a patio deck with a perfect view of the Space Needle especially beautiful at sunset. We would definitely rent from Eve again!"
6990477,39652722,2015-07-25,36840624,Marilyn,"Eve was great, she was easy to work with and the place was exactly as described in the listing.  Eve recommended some places to eat that were excellent and made herself available to answer any questions we might have.  As a first time to Airbnb, it was a good experience."
6990477,39967718,2015-07-27,2348707,Jacqueline,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle and the apartment was great. Easy to walk to all the major sites in the city, and coffee, breakfast, and grocery options within 1-2 blocks. Jesslyn met us early on a Saturday and let us drop off our bags early which was great. The apartment was nicely decorated and very clean and comfortable.  We would definitely stay again. Thanks! "
6990477,40616298,2015-08-01,36665649,Ronda,"It's been absolutely a pleasure to stay at Eve's apartment. Everything is new and well maintained. Eve is a wonderful host with great taste. She responded to questions very quickly and made sure that I don't have to worry about anything during my stay. She's got all the stuff you will have in a 5 star hotel. It was so comfortable that I wish I could spend a whole month there. The apartment is in a very convenient location, and I like this neighborhood very much. I walked to places during my stay and I found it very pleasant and easy to get around from this apartment. It has a great view of the space needle and the downtown area at the rooftop deck. Whole Foods is almost right downstairs. I would definitely find Eve again if I'm visiting Seattle and need a place to stay. In fact, I was so glad that I found Eve before I booked a hotel in the same area."
6990477,41970679,2015-08-10,13937438,Joshua,"This location was great! Me and my friends stayed and it was well furnished. We enjoyed our stay in Seattle very much. It was right next to a Whole Foods and plenty of restaurants just a few blocks away which was very convenient. The place was quiet, clean, and very comfortable. I would pick Morgan as a host again if I ever visit Seattle again in the future!"
6990477,42552566,2015-08-14,37724424,Stephanie,"Morgan was great. She was very prompt with her responses and providing answers to questions.  The apartment was nice and very clean.  The location of the apartment was excellent, we were able to walk to everywhere. Thanks for a great stay!"

6990477,43464478,2015-08-19,41662243,Madeline,I had such an amazing experience in Seattle thanks to Morgan! Great space and great location. She was so helpful and made the stay as easy and relaxing as possible. 
6990477,43694807,2015-08-21,3577571,Chris,"Morgan was great. She was waiting for us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed.

This is the kind of airbnb we like. The place was clean and there was no clutter (other people's stuff) all over. Just the basics needed for an enjoyable stay. 

We'll definitely be staying here again."
6990477,43953979,2015-08-23,27435280,Max,Morgan was a great host! She was very accommodating and her place was beautiful. Perfect location. Very modern. Highly recommended! 
6990477,44924185,2015-08-30,37920161,Patrick,"Experience was fantastic. Great apartment, clean and new. Perfect walking distance to lots of stuff and lots of things to do in the immediate area. Morgan was able to accommodate our early check-in request, which was really helpful. Would totally go back again!"
6990477,46206637,2015-09-08,15558463,Emily,"Morgan was a great host. She provided very detailed information for our stay, which made our experience seamless. We felt right and home and couldn't have been more comfortable. The location was perfect--easy walking distance to City Center, Capitol Hill, etc. We highly recommend Morgan's place and would love to stay here again. "
6990477,46731190,2015-09-13,39033266,Justin,"Getting into the apartment was very easy.  Apartment was ready on time and the neighborhood was very convenient to access nearby Whole Foods Market, Seattle Center area, and Lake Union.  Apartment is as listed on Airbnb.  We had a great stay in Seattle."
6990477,47317748,2015-09-17,43907030,Dror,"This was my first Airbnb booking and I was worried about the experience. Though I cannot compare it to other Airbnb bookings (yet), I’m happy to say that I couldn’t have asked for a better start!

Daniela was very friendly, responsive and accommodating. It shows that she really care about the wellbeing and comfort of her guest. The apartment is very welcoming, convenience and had all the amenities that were published and more. 

I’ve traveled for business and spend my time at the Washington convention center that was a short walk away.
I definitely see myself coming back to this place when I’m back to Seattle, whether for business or pleasure.

Thanks Daniela!
"
6990477,47702115,2015-09-21,17200569,Becca,The unit was very clean. Unit seems to be used as an air b&b only. Not too much character but really nice and great location.  Lots of places to walk to for eating and drinking. Parking was expensive so if you can don't have a car with you. The host was great and very responsive. 
6990477,48706812,2015-09-28,38408536,Ethan,"Apartment is in a great area, easy to walk to everything in downtown Seattle and South Lake Union area.  Apartment is as appears in the pictures as well"
6990477,49464695,2015-10-04,12073511,Katja,We stayed with Daniela & Michael during a conference in Seattle. The apartment was exactly like it was described and we enjoyed the close proximity of the conference center as well as the the city very much. Especially the great convenience of a whole food supermarket and the great view from the terrace sweetend our days in Seattle. The information policy of Daniela was great: upfront we received a lot of helpful infomation on the apartment and the surroundings and during our stay she was always helpful and responded promptly to our questions and wishes. Awesome!
6990477,50174481,2015-10-10,24046720,Jeremy,"Daniela was a great host. She was prompt and responsive at every point of contact throughout the duration. The room itself was clean, relaxing, and had a warm-welcoming vibe to it. The location was great as well; walking distance to all the tourist spots. There is even a whole foods right down the street for when you want to cook. Overall it was a great experience, this is now my go-to spot for when I come back to Seattle. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a positive experience."
6990477,52469548,2015-10-29,47506485,Matthew,Awesome place. Clean and in a good area. I really enjoyed my stay.
6990477,53397399,2015-11-08,6165113,Efren,"Flat is amazing, superb located and in a deluxe building. There is a gym with basketball court and amazing views from the terrace. Cannot ask more for a flat!"

6495424,51503686,2015-10-20,46416625,Cyrena,"John, his family and dog were great.  John gave me a call when we landed and we met up later.  They gave us a tour of the house and told us all about the surrounding area and what to do.  The house had amazing views, was very comfortable inside and the backyard was really nice to hang out in.  "
1260259,5332755,2013-06-24,6961066,Annalisa,"This was a very positive experience: I warmly recommend this little paradise if you want to visit Seattle and at the same time stay away from tourist area. The house was spotless, cozy and the little garden a gem!
Jess left me a lovely note and everything went according to expectation! Thank so much Jess you will hear from me again for sure!!!"
1260259,5476614,2013-07-01,43971,Andrea,Lovely place! Highly recommended. :)
1260259,5740455,2013-07-14,217728,Issac,"Jess' place is lovingly maintained you can tell she really cares and takes pride in it. She is generous and human in her hosting, which we could perceive even without having met her. A beautiful spot for a getaway in Seattle. The neighborhood is convenient to downtown and various areas of Seattle, the shower is terrific, the sauna is inviting, the house surrounded by flowers and interesting plants, and there are cool parks nearby with great views. I was in town just for a day and a half but could have enjoyed much longer based from Jess' place. The description is correct: this house is very much in the woods, and although there is a close neighbor to one side that you don't see from the house, right outside the living room french doors is a forest and it is totally quiet. Amazing to be in the city and yet very much in the quiet woods - that makes this spot very special."
1260259,6095021,2013-07-29,133711,Alex,"A beautiful cozy home in a quiet neighborhood. The house is perfectly appointed, and Jess was a great host. Look forward to staying again!"
1260259,6446446,2013-08-12,4413044,Dan,"Jess made the reservation process easy and her place is everything we were looking for- peaceful, comfortable, clean, and minutes from Ballard, Fremont, and downtown. Certainly worth another, and hopefully longer, stay."
1260259,7040278,2013-09-04,2464302,Roy,My folks stayed here for 5 nights and loved the quiet location.  Jess has a wonderfully furnished and decorated home.  Thanks Jess!
1260259,7203820,2013-09-10,8289258,Christa,"We didn't get to stay long but it was still a great little house to rest our heads at.  It was very peaceful and relaxing, which was perfect after the stressful drive to Seattle!  "
1260259,8098085,2013-10-15,625479,Andrew,"Great little spot.  Tons of foliage outside.  Peaceful.  Great location near discover park, Magnolia, and Ballard.  Exactly as described.  Jess was easy to deal with.  No issues.  
"
1260259,8599014,2013-11-07,5161039,AnnMarie,"Jess's place was lovely and very comfortable. Very clean and cozy, and a great location close to Discovery Park. Would definitely recommend!"
1260259,11332458,2014-03-30,11015754,Sherrie,"This home is warm, cozy, inviting and thoughtfully designed and laid out.
We completely enjoyed our time here and wished we could have stayed longer!
It's a welcoming refuge- a little bit of country in the city- and a block from Discovery Park.
I highly recommend it!
Also, my impression is that Jess is a warm, generous and welcoming person."
1260259,11704931,2014-04-12,13906764,Cate,"Jess's place was the perfect cozy (& hip) place to relax during a stressful week. I spent most of the day exploring discovery park, which is just a short walk through the neighborhood to reach beautiful beaches and bluffs looking out to the Olympic mountain range. I picked up my friend from the airport and we got to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise through the forested ravine from Jess's back porch. I wish we could have stayed longer! (wanted to use the sauna but the day slipped away) We never met jess or her neighbors but we exchanged friendly and helpful emails."
1260259,11781874,2014-04-14,14064648,Orianne,"This was such a lovely place to stay.... truly a wooded little oasis in the city, and so easy to access the many interesting areas of Seattle from.  The wood fired sauna was a special treat. I definitely hope to return soon!  "
1260259,13364671,2014-05-26,1248466,Tom,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary and it was a fantastic experience.  The home is small, but exquisitely tasteful and relaxing, perfect for two people. Everything we needed was there. It was obvious that Jess works hard to provide an excellent rental experience.   Coffee in the early morning on the back deck was memorable and sensual with all the lush natural landscape.  The sauna was a plus although it helps to have wood stove lighting skills to get it going.  Once the fire is going, it heats the sauna very quickly and uses little wood--we used it both nights we were there and it was the hit of the trip.  The area is gorgeous and quiet.  The loop trail in Discovery Park was great and at 2.8 miles, perfect for a stroll.  The park is 3 minutes away, if that, and Ballard, Magnolia, Fremont, and downtown less than 10.   All in all, it was a perfect way to experience Seattle and I would recommend this place to anyone. "
1260259,14174632,2014-06-13,16588957,Rachel,The home is lovely and quaint.  the surroundings are stunning.  We loved the magnolia neighborhood and had a great stay at this oasis! 
1260259,14218855,2014-06-15,3155616,Katy,"The Zen Garden Oasis was an easy place to stay for a quick night in Seattle.  We were able to explore Ballard and some of the beautiful local parks and lookouts.  The bed was comfortable, and Jess was so easy to communicate with; check in/out was a breeze.  Everything was as expected.  Thanks Jess!"
1260259,14296041,2014-06-16,14562894,Tessa,Amazing space. Absolutely beautiful place to spend a day or a weekend or even longer. She was a gracious host and very easy to communicate with. Did I say the place is stunning? It is truly an oasis. 
1260259,14449390,2014-06-19,2396938,Ed,"Cool, clean, chill environment. Schedule was hectic and I was unable to truly appreciate. Will be back. "
1260259,14666550,2014-06-23,16645684,Jennifer,"Great space, cozy and efficient. Hammock to relax in and WIFI were pleasant surprises. Located super close to Discovery park but you feel as though you are already in a park while staying here, beautiful! Jess was responsive and easy to communicate with - a great experience all around."
1260259,14781865,2014-06-26,2897164,Jennifer And Michael,My mom and I stayed at Jess's place for two nights. We had a wonderful stay in her cozy cottage and especially enjoyed the back patio. Jess was a great communicator and accommodating host.
1260259,15404202,2014-07-08,15524171,Michelle,"We stayed at Jess's place for 5 wonderful days!  It is perfectly located, my husband went jogging in the park that is literally next door every morning.  We used the sauna 4 out of 5 of the nights, so fun to have that in the backyard.  We ate all of our meals on the back porch - it feels like there are no neighbors nearby even though there are.  It is in a very safe area and convenient to everything we wanted to do. We met some of the neighbors and they were so nice. The place is tiny but so well organized and has everything you need. Jess was always available to answer any questions, but I don't think we ever needed anything.  Parking is right out front, nice especially in a town where parking is hard to come by."
1260259,16244385,2014-07-24,13936109,Boyd,"Jess's Zen Garden Oasis is just as she describes it in the listing.  Small but charming, comfortable, very private, and convenient to bus stops and an upscale grocery store. It is her home, so expect to share the limited space with her personal belongings.  My wife and I spent an entire week in the Zen Garden while visiting our daughter, who lives in Magnolia.  We would definitely stay there again.  Jess is a great hostess---leaves you alone unless you need something."
1260259,16671485,2014-07-31,17480394,Micah,"The house was cozy and lovely, and Jess was responsive when we had questions. "
1260259,16782895,2014-08-02,6170790,Anh,"We really enjoyed the location and offerings of Jess's Zen Garden Oasis.  We relaxed outdoors on the beautiful deck.  We ate too much at Finn's bakery.  Her house was comfortable and decorated nicely with unique trinkets and possible one of a kind travels finds .  We hiked at Discovery Park and loved the Ballard Locks, which were very close by."
1260259,17381084,2014-08-11,9045757,Sarah,"This place was lovely beyond lovely - simple, well-designed, beautiful garden & decor, comfy bed, fully equipped kitchen, not to mention a sauna. It is situated in a peaceful, green suburb a short drive from downtown and down the road from a large park. The host was very easy to work with. Would highly recommend. "
1260259,17549218,2014-08-13,17828800,Erin,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Jess's place. She was able to accommodate us last minute which was great. Her place was so cute and relaxing, we felt right at home. Everything was how it was described and exceeded our expectations. What a lovely place to enjoy the Seattle rain. It was only about a 15 minute drive from downtown. Would highly recommend it to anyone!"
1260259,17970017,2014-08-19,1428645,Lily,"What a lovely spot -- the location was perfect for our first trip to Seattle. We spent a lot of time in Ballard which is just over the bridge; explored Discovery Park (walking or driving distance), and had an easy drive to downtown. The house is tucked away just enough so you feel like you're in a private retreat. We loved having the back patio for coffee-sipping on the crisp mornings. Great location and Jess was a super friendly host."
1260259,19165552,2014-09-07,4006551,Mary,A very great and relaxing space.  I loved how the French doors opened to the outdoor Zen garden area.  Jess was very accommodating and responsive.  Thank you so much for sharing your space with us!  Would definitely stay here again.  
1260259,19481116,2014-09-13,15931245,Rob,"Jess was a great host and the house was excellent.  I didn't get to use the sauna, but the hammock out back is a great place to relax.  If I get the chance, I'm looking forward to coming back."
1260259,19634289,2014-09-15,4546892,Michelle,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jess's cottage! It is cozy, decorated with natural materials, plenty of space for 2 people and the yard is really wonderful. It was nice to run around Seattle with friends but then have a quiet place in the trees to come back to! 
The cottage is tucked into a residential neighborhood within walking distance of Discovery Park and the #33 bus to downtown which we took one of the days. It was easy to drive over to Ballard, the shops in Magnolia and downtown. 
The house is even nicer than the pictures, we had everything we needed and Jess left us with a little print out about the house and the neighborhood which was nice. We went to the little bakery that her nephew runs and our breakfast was delicious! 
I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!"
1260259,20299442,2014-09-27,20946526,Bill,"My wife and I had a wonderful four night stay at the Zen Garden Oasis. The house was very comfortable and met our needs very well. It was in a good location, with easy access to public transportation and was a reasonable walk to the Ballard neighborhood, where our daughter lives. We also enjoyed exploring to Discovery Park, which was very close by. Jess, the owner was very responsive and willing to be flexible on timing for our arrival and departure. We highly recommend this lodging."
1260259,21140767,2014-10-12,20849963,Karen,"What a lovely and peaceful little house! The house is bright and clean, and the back porch is also a wonderful place to hang out. The neighborhood is quiet and within an easy walk of Discovery Park, and we also enjoyed - at Jess' suggestion - walking over the Ballard Locks to visit the Ballard Kiss Cafe. Although we didn't meet Jess in person, she responded quickly to any messages, gave us some nice recommendations for places to visit, and left us a nice not to greet us upon our arrival. We definitely felt welcome and comfortable - highly recommended."
1260259,21490454,2014-10-18,3150315,Victoria,"Great quiet location by the park, beautiful house, super clean and cozy. A Real Oasis in the city!"
1260259,22277621,2014-11-02,23051523,Melissa,"Jess' Zen Garden Oasis was a wonderful place to stay in the beautiful Seattle neighborhood of Magnolia.  Her home is incredibly clean, relaxing and contains all needed amenities for a stay of any duration.  Jess was easy to communicate with, and a gracious host - leaving out extra clean sheets and towels.  She even had out some festive Halloween decorations which out 2 year old daughter enjoyed!  Would definitely recommend a stay here."
1260259,22612263,2014-11-10,22967737,Lindy,Everything was great! The listing was accurately described. It was the perfect spot for my family during their weekend visit. I will look into renting again during future trips. 
1260259,22959506,2014-11-18,6527748,Jennifer,"Jess was great and very accommodating to our needs. The neighborhood is very quiet and perfect for a cozy retreat from the busy city. By renting a car, we were able to explore Seattle from Fremont to downtown Pike's Place Market. The space is well heated and the bed was comfortably supportive. Shower has really good water pressure. I didn't get a chance to try out the wood burning sauna but it looks neat! "
1260259,23074881,2014-11-22,23051523,Melissa,We had a second stay at Jess' home and the visit was equally comfortable as the first.  Very accommodating host & a very nice property.  The french press coffee pot was a nice plus to use! 
1260259,24737548,2015-01-02,13936109,Boyd,"This was our second extended stay at Jess's Zen Garden Oasis.  As before, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  This time we made use of the wood-fired sauna.  
Jess always makes us feel welcome, although we've never met her in person.  The little cottage is immaculate.  No TV, but you won't care.    
"
1260259,25613573,2015-01-20,5111315,Adam,"Jess's place was amazing, we loved staying there! Her place has everything you need, nothing you don't. Even though there are neighbors on both sides, with its overlook on the park it feels like you're in a cabin in the woods, bring your own coffee (the nearest place is 10 minutes away and often closed) and you're set! Though we never met her personally, Jessica was a great host: the house was really clean and her guide to the house and the neighborhood was really simple, clear and useful. We'd definitely stay again. 

"
1260259,26657769,2015-02-16,1887975,Tania,"Beautiful home in an amazing location. We walked out dogs in Discovery park every day we were there, gorgeous scenery just right outside her door. Jess was extremely accommodating with our check in and check out times which was really nice on our last day. We had an amazing time and can't wait to visit again :)"
1260259,28751825,2015-03-29,9267933,Christopher,"Wonderful, quiet little house. The location is excellent - very close to the park and an easy drive downtown. "
1260259,29332751,2015-04-06,4401614,Jami,"Jess's home is absolute perfection! It is serene yet affords great access to all of Seattle. It is also situated right across the street from Discovery Park, which is the most beautiful park in Seattle! 

The outdoor covered patio was perfect to lounge on and have our morning coffee before heading out for the day. It looks out onto a lush ravine that complements her already zen garden and atmosphere. The sauna was a treat too! 

Jess's place is a gem and we can't wait to go back!"
1260259,30472486,2015-04-22,1632699,Deborah,"Jess' home is perfect in its simplicity, design and comfort (and close to the bus stop). I really appreciated Jess' prompt communication and help with my questions. "
1260259,31806444,2015-05-10,24173464,David,This place was awesome. The location is perfect especially if you have dogs. Very clean and in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the rest of the city.
1260259,32604012,2015-05-19,32693422,Sheena,Jess was a wonderful host. Her home is perfect for two and could not be more perfectly situated for exploring the area without staying downtown. Both the home and garden are very well kept and we would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you Jess!
1260259,33829218,2015-06-01,25844987,Ellie,"Loved the space! My husband and I were there with our dog for one night. Although the space isn't big, it didn't feel too crowded. It's a very well organized space with a beautiful backyard looking into trees and a small garden. Jess was prompt with her replies and friendly. It is her place so it felt very homey and comfy compared to some rental homes I've stayed at. It's close enough drive to Seattle downtown but far enough to stay away from all the noise and people."
1260259,34347545,2015-06-07,418684,Will,I loved staying at Jess's beautifully-designed house. Backing up to a heron rookery it feels completely private and induces peace as soon as you open the French doors to all the green. And the big trees and Sound views of Discovery Park are just across the street. Jess was responsive and cheerful. Highly recommended.
1260259,34959078,2015-06-14,6308612,Brendan,"The Zen Garden retreat was perfect for my wife and I. A nice quiet retreat near the park. Convenient to stores and Ballard Locks. 
The backyard sitting area expanded the apartment and made for a bigger feel. While we did not meet Jess she was very responsive with ideas and questions we had. We would highly recommend the Zen Garden to anyone traveling to Seattle who seeks a quiet, clean and restful place to stay. "
1260259,35376179,2015-06-18,30810755,Brigitte,"Jess's  house had the feel of a cozy cottage. Adorable and very accommodating, clean, excellent stay. Our family enjoyed her house and backyard. It was very quiet and serene with beautiful landscaping. "
1260259,35822928,2015-06-22,11281941,Johanna,"We loved our stay at Jess' adorable one bedroom. It's just the perfect size and is very clean and well cared for. The back porch hammock and sauna are amazing and the neighborhood is convenient to lots of places, especially Discovery Park. It's exactly the kind of stay you hope for on Airbnb-- one where you can pretend it's your house for a weekend :)"
1260259,36395580,2015-06-28,16578838,Beth,Jess' cottage is a great little hideaway in Seattle; perfect for our one-week stay in the city.  
1260259,37991016,2015-07-12,25794885,Zac,Jess was an unbelievable host and her house was the perfect place for my wife and I.  Her minimalist design is the perfect touch for the space. We felt like we were in New Zealand!
1260259,38291380,2015-07-14,5607668,Amanda,"Jessica's house is small but very charming and thoughtful. It's tiny living done extremely well. It's also located in between two parks, which makes it feel like you're not even in the city (Discovery Park is one of the nicest in Seattle). The kitchen is well-equipped with quality appliances and cookware, and the neighbors were especially welcoming and helpful. Thank you, Jess, for a wonderful stay!"
1260259,39028790,2015-07-20,35333441,Jeff,The house was exactly as described.  A perfect Oasis in a fantastic location in Seattle.  We will come back and stay again!  Thanks for the great accommodation!
1260259,39863699,2015-07-26,30865630,Kira,Loved staying in Jess's house. Jess was very easy to communicate with and super friendly. All instructions were clearly written and left for me on the table upon arrival. Great house and area - was able to go biking in Discovery Park which is a block away. Also walked to the Locks and into Old Ballard for dinner. Felt very secluded and with nature :-) I liked that she had a washer/dryer to use because some of my clothes got dirty while hiking/biking/kayaking. Highly recommended listing. I would stay here again. 
1260259,40108511,2015-07-28,35433006,Randi Kay,"We loved staying here. Jess was easy to contact and replied quickly with any questions we had. We were so impressed with how clean her place was when we arrived. It smelled so good too! We had a rental car, so the location worked well for us, but if you are looking for easy access to Seattle Center tourist stuff, you may want to be closer. I would highly recommend staying at Jess' place for sure. "
1260259,43033368,2015-08-17,32601872,Melissa,"Jess has a unique and beautiful cottage located in a very secluded part of Magnolia in Seattle. Those who stay here will  be welcomed by a stunning view of the ravine out back, and the sound of rain and birds. It's a cozy +lovely place. Having lived in the neighborhood previously, it was a rare treat to re-visit old haunts, and discover new ones. My only regret was not having more time there."
1260259,43407261,2015-08-19,941137,Kristie,"My son and I had a wonderful 2 night stay at Jess's Zen Garden Oasis. It's important to me to have a sanctuary to return to after a day of sightseeing and Jess's home fit the bill perfectly.  We didn't cook because of all the great restaurants to explore in Seattle but, we did do a load of laundry.  After a roadtrip of mostly camping, it was nice to have a load of clean laundry.  We would recommend Jess's home to either a small family or a couple looking for a calm and beautiful retreat.  "
1260259,44439679,2015-08-26,38626874,Kathleen,"Jess was very hospitable.  She even invited us to enjoy her cherry tomatoes in the raised bed garden.  They were great!
All was exactly as advertised.  The neighborhood is safe and quiet."
1260259,47165987,2015-09-16,40142128,Terry,"This little hideaway tucked off a small, quiet street in Magnolia is the perfect place if you're looking for a comfortable home base removed from the hustle and bustle. Jess was a responsive, unobtrusive, flexible host. Discovery Park entrance is a block away, an excellent market just another block or so, and the Ballard Locks and shopping/restaurant district maybe 15 minutes' walk. We'd definitely stay there again.  "
1260259,48777848,2015-09-28,43795974,Aaron,"A quiet location in a safe neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle, but also easy access to everything!  We borrowed a friend's car, so we were able quickly access nearby restaurants and grocery stores.  We could also make easy trips into downtown for the usual tourist stops.  Jess was so nice to leave her two bikes, which we used for quick rides to Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks.  There's a bus stop nearby, which would probably make a car-free trip work just fine.  The home was just as described - a little hidden oasis with beautiful landscaping and just the right amount of space for our 5-day trip with 2 adults and 1 child.  We'd definitely stay here again!"
1260259,52502009,2015-10-30,33461080,Ryan,"This is my favorite spot in Seattle!  The privacy of lush forest merging onto the deck through the back door, the ever-changing beach in Discovery Park, the mysterious nature-filled inlet connecting Lake Union's shipping locks with Puget Sound (accessed via a secret trail), and Ballard's bustling main drag only a few minutes further walk.  Chopping wood, lighting the fire, and soaking in the sauna topped off the whole experience.  Apart from the walks and a couple errands, I didn't even need to leave, so didn't rent a car.

Jess' house is kept simple and tidy, but has everything a guest house should.   "
1260259,54940559,2015-11-25,24069351,Anne,We had such a lovely stay at Jess's place. It is in a great location - very close to Discovery Park and all of their great hiking trails and walking distance to Ballard.  We hope to make it back here soon!
1260259,55175833,2015-11-28,17287546,Lucas,"This space is really beautiful and peaceful. Jess was really easy to work with, and made a last minute booking painless! Really great feel inside. Truly a home feel. Also just a very short walk from the best park in Seattle, Discovery park. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
1260259,55542899,2015-12-01,626760,Daniel,"It's definitely an oasis. Tucked into a quiet corner of Seattle, this cute little place backs up onto a nice ravine and is steps away from Discovery Park. It's very relaxing inside and out, though I didn't get to try the sauna! "
5651254,29853908,2015-04-13,18265836,John & Lauren,"We traveled to Seattle to celebrate our first wedding anniversary... It was a beautiful spring day.  We rode the ferry from Bremerton into the Emerald City, got gorgeous flowers at the Pike Street Market... drove to West Seattle and found the ""Beautiful Craftsman Style Home""... And it was! Amy set everything up for us, the house was so comfortable, location perfect for our needs. It is close to all the culture of the neighborhood, dining, shopping, craft-breweries and of course the natural beauty of the Puget Sound region! The bed was super-comfy! Ahhhh! The only part that was unfortunate is that we were only there for one night! Thanks for your hospitality, Amy! We'd like to come stay with you again! "
5651254,33321354,2015-05-26,22591835,Valya,"We had a fantastic time at Amy's home this Memorial Day weekend!  Amy, herself, was a flexible, generous host and the house (especially the guest bedroom) was delightfully cozy; complete with a dog possessing an equally cozy coat of fur and personality.  On top of that, Amy's home is in a great location; it is within walking distance of the ferry to Vashon Island (which we regrettably ran out of time for), a handful  of great places to eat, and several bus stations (of both land and sea) which can take you downtown in a flash.  By the third and final day of our stay, it became apparent that even a three-day weekend at Amy's was not long enough.  While we did get a chance to talk to Amy and sight-see downtown, we did not have our fill of either.  We are grateful for her hospitality and generosity for welcoming us into her home, and we hope to make a return visit someday.  If you would like to stay somewhere close to downtown Seattle but would also like a comfortable, relaxing environment, then Amy would be an ideal host."
5651254,35477002,2015-06-19,5379193,Betty,Amy is a gracious host and her home is lovely. We had a too-brief stay but loved the local pizza and coffee house choices and walk to the park.
8310249,46852327,2015-09-13,16646281,Chelsea,"James is a wonderful host with a genuine generous spirit.  Before we arrived and during our stay, James was reliably available and often addressed our questions/needs before we even asked.  
The room and bathroom were as described - clean, simple, and comfortable.  On a suburban street, the neighborhood is both quiet and calm and a brief walk from all the action that Ballard has to offer.
Airbnb works when hosts are kind, reliable, honest, and caring.  James is one of them!"
8310249,48045135,2015-09-22,44200822,Wakanene,"James was a wonderful host. He made us feel right at home with WiFi, a kitchen to use and the friendly, occasional company of Patty, the dog. He was always willing to give us some tips on getting around, suggestions for places to visit, and restaurants to check out. Would "
8310249,49963599,2015-10-07,33857198,Jonathan,"A great place to stay, recent renovation and well equipped. Nice neighborhood, co-guests delightful. Fantastic Host. Knowledgable about the locality and Seattle interests. A compelling traveler himself."
8310249,50058612,2015-10-08,9415156,Jurriaan,"Wow we were welcomed in person by James, really relaxed guy, with great tips on foot, shops and indeed the walk nearby to the Locks was great! House clean and nice, beds very nice matras."
8310249,50422348,2015-10-11,19978283,Molly,James was very friendly! Gave us the rundown and let us be. It was a perfect location to see a part of city for a night. 
8310249,51258816,2015-10-18,14654979,Alyssa,Awesome experience with Aaron while Jason was away on business. Thank you for being so easy going and available. 
8310249,51461667,2015-10-20,44405151,Catherine,"We didn't get to meet James but his friend Aaron took good care of the stay. The home was clean and you share a bathroom with guests from another room. Refrigertor and stove were very clean too. The only thing to keep in mind is that they don't provide hairdryer yet (but have been working on it). Sometimes at night you would hear the train, but it didn't bother our sleep much tho. Overall it's a nice place to stay at."
8310249,52029886,2015-10-25,47228355,Kasey,Wonderful place with a great location and friendly hosts. 
8310249,53065225,2015-11-04,1032519,Jean-Christian,Nice place and convenient location!
8310249,53948493,2015-11-14,6212932,Janet,"James was able to accommodate us on a last-minute booking and was friendly, super responsive, and helpful throughout. The room was comfortable and the house was clean. James also gave us some great tips on things to check out in Ballard."
8310249,54553968,2015-11-21,48986903,Anne,"James was a very generous and resourceful host. The apartment/rooms that he rents is/are spotless, welcoming and warm. And we spent a great evening in Ballard, fantastic restaurants (we followed james' advices and his recommendations were impecable), fun beer ""rooms"" and great coffee. Both james and its house location made our seattle stay a    More than pleasant experience. "
8310249,55818954,2015-12-06,42402516,Kamilah,"Had a great weekend getaway in Ballard. This place is close to lots of cute coffee shops, in a great walkable neighbourhood— and there's an awesome farmers' market on Sunday morning. Thanks for making us feel  welcome, James! Definitely be back another weekend."
3959442,19571268,2014-09-14,21026289,Derk,A lovely nice little space! Everything you need when exploring a city like Seattle! Very easy to reach and also a place to park your car! When we return to Seattle I would def. ask Rebecca to stay at her place again!
3959442,19797593,2014-09-18,3493472,Sapana,"Rebecca was the most helpful host. I booked her studio apartment for my parents. It was a great location, close to lots of restaurants and downtown. There is also a parking spot! The apartment is very clean and cozy, my parents loved it and felt very comfortable staying there. "
3959442,20048587,2014-09-22,5364065,Casey,"The host was great and gave us many tips about the neighborhood. The studio was immaculate and had everything you could want. Its very close to many restaurants, bars, and shop. Would definitely stay there again!"
3959442,20171715,2014-09-24,684995,Rachel & Shane,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely studio. The apartment is beautifully decorated, with nice light and within walking distance from many restaurants. Clearly a lot of care had been put into making it a great place to stay. And the full kitchen is stocked with coffee and tea!

Rebecca was a great host -- she was very responsive when we made our reservation, gave us excellent restaurant recommendations, and even left an iron in the apartment that we needed for a job interview.  Highly recommend this as a place to stay!"
3959442,20449897,2014-09-29,2971221,Mike,"The small apartment was perfect. Clean, organized and in agreat neighborhhood. Rebecca was responsive and kept me informed. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3959442,20715066,2014-10-04,7973592,Ingrid,Staying at Rebecca's apartment was a blast. Rebecca did a great job with all the love she has put into her apartment. Arriving from Europe I instantly felt at home. I can not imagine a better place to stay for exploring Seattle and the nearby country side. Rebecca even provided me a bike which was a perfect thing to have when navigating through the city during traffic. When coming back to Seattle one day I'm looking forward to stay at Rebecca's again. Thank you!
3959442,20913599,2014-10-07,1603365,Colin,"Staying at Rebecca's studio was great. Very clean apartment with a nice aesthetic, walkable to lots of activities near by, and she was a pleasure to deal with. I'd stay there again!"
3959442,21529759,2014-10-19,21539079,Alex,"Rebecca's apartment was perfect; cozy and convenient. It's in a beautiful neighborhood that is easy for travel. We used busses quite a bit and walked even more. The apartment is wonderfully clean and well maintained with an equipped kitchen.
Rebecca was very pleasant, responsive, and helpful.

We were extremely impressed and pleased by our experience here. Recommend and would return. "
3959442,21678028,2014-10-21,13527,Jenny & Justine,"Rebecca and Ann were wonderful hosts. They were there at our arrival to show us around, made sure we had everything we needed, gave us recommendations to excellents restaurants and places to go to feel like locals and home, and we did feel like locals! They made themselves available whenever we needed. The place itself was a very fair size for one couple, it was very clean and cosy, the bathroom was pleasant, with organic bath products, in a nutshell, the cabin was a perfect little love nest for our 3 days in Seattle. Will definitely be our number one choice of accomodation next come back next time we visit Seattle!"
3959442,21961307,2014-10-27,2017223,Emma,"Our stay was perfect! Very nice, clean, and beautifully furnished studio with super good location. Easy walk to many great restaurants. Highly recommended! "

She has put much thought into creating a welcoming and comfortable space. The location is perfect too with excellent food just a short walk away!"
3959442,23427616,2014-12-01,20712163,Dragana,"I have stayed at Rebecca's place with my husband for the whole month and we really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. The apartment is well situated, perfectly clean and have all the amenities that you could think of. The apartment is close to city centre, close to all public transportation and has shops and restaurants nearby, though it is in a very quiet neighbourhood which makes it perfect. All you need is available in a couple of minutes. Staying at Rebecca's was a lovely experience, she was a friendly and supportive host and she was there if any question popped up. On our final week we were generously invited to our first Thanksgiving dinner, an amazing experience for us. Rebecca and Anne thank you for a great Thanksgiving evening, it was very funny and delicious ☺. We definitely recommend Rebecca's apartment. "
3959442,24134937,2014-12-21,12457387,Paulina,"My parents stayed here for two weeks in December. They had a great time, and only good things to say. Rebecca was a friendly and very accommodating host. The studio was quiet, cozy and lovely, the bed divine! We would absolutely recommend it, and will most probably book it again for their next trip to Seattle."
3959442,24975927,2015-01-04,12935763,Sara,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rebecca's studio! It's tucked away which made for quiet nights yet close to the bus lines and downtown and within walking distance of great restaurants--the location was ideal.

The apartment itself was super cute, cozy, and clean and Rebecca was a great host. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
3959442,25310105,2015-01-12,23311909,Sara,"My week at Rebecca's was really amazing. When I got to the apartment, she had left me a full list of things to do, walks to take, and restaurants to try that - as a Seattle native - I approve of 100%. The apartment itself was wonderful. Natural light comes in during the day and it never got too cold, not even in early January. The place feels very private and quiet, and Rebecca left a few books on the bedside table that I couldn't put down the whole week. With a brightly colored, full-functioning kitchen, a crazy comfortable bed, and a bathroom with a bathtub big enough to actually relax in, this apartment will provide ample inspiration for when I am decorating my own. Rebecca left some tea, coffee, and candy for me to enjoy, making them place feel even more like home. At some points I almost forgot I was staying in someone else's apartment. 

The neighborhood is lovely, close enough to the main streets like 12th and Madison to provide easy and accessible walks to restaurants, stores, and wonderful coffee, but removed enough to allow for a very peaceful and safe atmosphere. I would highly recommend this apartment, and I hope to make it my usual place of residence whenever I return to Seattle. 

A big thanks to Rebecca and her family! Congratulations on creating and maintaining a wonderful, welcoming home. "
3959442,25767204,2015-01-25,2373680,Nader,There is no better place to in Seattle. Check-in was a breeze and Rebecca's instructions made finding the place very simple. The apartment is clean and cozy. It was the perfect size for a solo traveler but would probably be fine for 2 people as well. I was able to walk everywhere and the neighborhood is full of great things to eat and drink!
3959442,25970702,2015-01-31,22282240,Gwen,"Rebecca's studio was even more lovely in real life than the excellent photos portrayed! The location was great. The studio is within easy walking distance to grocery stores, delicious restaurants and fun bars, yet tucked away in a safe and quiet residential neighborhood. I needed to bring a rental car for my trip to Seattle, and greatly appreciated the free designated parking spot and quick access to the freeways.  Rebecca was quick and friendly in communication, making arrival smooth and pleasant. The studio is also very well stocked with Seattle travel resources, ample storage space for clothing and luggage, and equipped with all the appliances and basics I needed for a week stay. I would definitely love to return to stay here, and highly recommend the studio to new and/or seasoned visitors in Seattle!"
3959442,26421280,2015-02-12,7242555,James,"Yes, the host greeted us personally and showed us around the apartment, answering any questions we might have. The apartment is in a nice residential area, convenient to restaurants and bus transportation downtown.
The apartment was clean and orderly.
Everything was pretty much as advertised."
3959442,26561431,2015-02-15,339780,Tracey,"I loved staying here!  Rebecca's place is lovely--from its location on Capitol Hill to its well-designed appointments--and Rebecca is a very thoughtful host.  Rebecca made herself available for flexible check-in and check-out, and let me know she was close by should I want for anything.  I'd lived in this neighborhood a few years ago so didn't need the recommendations or directions, but saw in the notebook that was left for visitors that all of this was nicely compiled for reference.  Lastly: the excellent bed is no small thing--I believe that's the most comfortable bed I've EVER slept in---dreamy.   Thanks, Rebecca, and should I be in Seattle again will check with you for availability!"
3959442,26913434,2015-02-22,19627582,Meredith,"We loved our time in Seattle and enjoyed staying in the studio. Rebecca was a wonderful host. She was there to welcome us and give us a quick tour and was available for any questions. The studio was cozy and inviting. The location was perfect and allowed for us to walk to many of our destinations. 

If we are ever back in Seattle we would love to stay here again. "
3959442,27185587,2015-02-27,26876668,Karen,Rebecca was a great easy to work with host and the space was exactly like the pictures. It really felt like home - great design + clean and cozy.   The guidebook she made was a big plus. I'll be back!
3959442,27601503,2015-03-08,11801898,Maree,"Rebecca's apartment was ideal for our first stay in seattle. She was super flexible and easy going as a host, the apartment was spotless and we were impressed by the quality of everything in the apartment from the super comfy bed to the luxurious towels (nice extra surprise and comfort while travelling). You just can't beat Capitol Hill as a location in seattle! It is the cultural hub, very central, so much to do around the apartment, yet it is so quiet. We only caught public transport to and from the airport-everything is walkable! I would not stay anywhere else on returning to seattle. Cheers again for the great stay :) "
3959442,27779542,2015-03-11,28510550,Spencer,"Our experience at Rebecca's studio was fantastic. Upon arrival it was super clean, modern and spacious-feeling. She was very welcoming and had even stocked the kitchen with a few essentials and condiments, which was beyond helpful. The location is only a couple miles from everything we wanted to access: the active area of capitol hill, downtown, a trader joes, some great restaurants and fantastic coffee, Stumptown being just a few blocks away and Victrola Coffee Roasters only about a mile and a half from the studio.

It was a great experience, would be more than happy to stay there again."
3959442,27848491,2015-03-13,25827701,Mandy,"The studio was fantastic! Bright, clean, super comfy bed and pillows. My only regret is not having more time to enjoy everything."
3959442,27935356,2015-03-15,1794426,Ricca,"This was a charming space that perfectly fit our needs for my husband's conference on the Seattle campus and a weekend getaway. It was clean, modern and inviting and Rebecca was a great hostess. She was waiting when we arrived and made herself very available in case we needed anything. She also recommended a couple great places to eat too. There was a parking space included which proved important and we were within walking distance of a ton of restaurants, shopping and attractions. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Seattle!"
3959442,28480071,2015-03-24,28189454,Cory,"Rebecca was a great host and let us know a lot about the neighborhood which made our stay in Seattle more enjoyable. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed tucked away. We were able to walk downtown, to restaurants a few blocks away, and the closest transit stop is only a block away."
3959442,28728010,2015-03-29,28718078,Marissa,"Rebecca made us feel very welcome in her home, she even gave us suggestions about local restaurants and hotspots. The neighborhood was quiet but it was nice that there was a more lively area only minutes away.  The studio was very neat and obviously very well taken care of, which made our experience there feel more homey. "
3959442,28932908,2015-04-01,8120423,Amanda,"Rebecca's studio apartment was amazing. It was immaculate and she had so many nice touches to make our stay enjoyable — available staples in the kitchen, ample towels, a power strip exactly where you would need it, and a helpful guide to local establishments. The bed was super comfy too.

I highly recommend this rental!"
3959442,29792619,2015-04-12,28587141,Wilfred,"I really enjoyed my stay in the cozy and quiet Modern Studio in Capitol Hill.  
Rebecca was responsive and she was able to meet me the day arrived to help me settle in.  The kitchen was great, it had pretty much all you would need for a short to mid term stay to make some basic meals, and more if you have the time to do so.  Everything was neat and in order. 
The documents and resources provided were helpful to navigate the immediate area and a deck of Seattle walking routes also provided some insight in some surrounding areas to see.  
I found the area to be located in a convenient spot to get to most areas of the city, easily walkable to downtown, Pike Place Market and of course the Pike/Pine area.  
I would look up this spot the next time I visit Seattle! 
If I had more a time, it would have been the perfect spot to relax and read some of the literature found at the bedside. "
3959442,29980006,2015-04-15,5702920,Mary,"My boyfriend and I fell in love with Rebecca's little apartment and Capitol Hill. Rebecca responded almost immediately to all of my texts, which I appreciated. Rebecca provided everything we needed - including a very helpful guide with recommendations for the area - and the apartment is perfectly private and beautifully designed. The area is absolutely beautiful, quiet, and close to all the best restaurants and bars. We did not rent a car and were able to walk just about everywhere (30 min walk to Pike Place Market), and there are plenty of Car2Go cars in the area if you want to drive. I highly recommend staying with Rebecca - make sure to stop by Americana on Broadway for brunch!"
3959442,30159809,2015-04-18,14841012,Meredith,"Rebecca was a wonderful and responsive host, and her apartment was an amazing place to stay that was very close to lots of things.  One word of caution:  laundry is negotiable for extended stays, which we didn't notice in the original description.  As long as you are fine with finding other laundry options, this is a perfect and impeccable place to stay in Seattle.  We would do it again!"
3959442,30450029,2015-04-22,5836515,James,"Rebecca's studio was really great, and we had a wonderful time staying there.  From the start Rebecca was great at communicating.  We knew everything we needed to know in advance.  The surrounding area made finding good food and coffee very convenient.  It was easy to get to downtown, and there are several transit stops a block or two away.  The neighborhood itself was quiet and beautiful to walk around in.  The studio apartment was perfectly sized for two people.  There is a full kitchen and refrigerator.  The wifi worked without issue, and there was (thankfully) a place to sit down and work.  The bed was very comfortable, and there is hanging closet space available.  Overall, this was a great place to stay in a great neighborhood.  We had everything we needed, and our host was very accessible.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
3959442,31945011,2015-05-12,28800561,Caroline,"Herzliche Gastgeberin. Hat sich vorher über unsere Ankunft informiert und auf jede Nachricht geantwortet. 
Die Beschreibung des Apartments trifft voll und ganz zu und liegt für erkundungen von Seattle in einer tollen Nachbarschaft. Nette Cafés und Restaurants fussläufig. "
3959442,32270904,2015-05-16,19913967,Steve,"I really enjoyed my stay at Rebecca's. She personally greeted me when I got lost, and showed me around the apartment. Cool little place!"
3959442,32699422,2015-05-20,10695332,Ben,"An absolutely beautiful studio only a short 5-10 minute walk to all kinds of restaurants and bars we got to enjoy over our stay. From parking in the alley, to the keyless lock, everything was well thought out and extremely convenient. "
3959442,32906352,2015-05-23,17459403,Ray,We really enjoyed our time in Rebecca's modern studio.  The description/pictures are accurate and the neighborhood is lovely with mature street trees and most everything you need within walking distance.  Rebecca recommended some local restaurants which we tried and really enjoyed.
3959442,33364728,2015-05-27,8805391,Manat,"The room is privately separated so we basically got the whole place for ourselves. It is very organized, very clean. The room provided right stuff for travelers. Bathroom came with good amenities, whereas, kitchen came with more than sufficient wares. Bed itself is very comfy, which gave us a boost, after a long walk of hiking at the beautiful nature around Seattle.
"
3959442,34530313,2015-06-09,29046071,Stacy,Rabecca was a wonderful host. She was there to greet us when we arrived and was quick to answer questions during our stay. The apartment was a lovely place to recoup after each exciting day of our visit. I would most definitely stay here again!
3959442,34788873,2015-06-12,32805928,Kristine,"Rebecca was a great host! She met us and gave us a quick tour of the apartment, everything was super clean and all the details were taken care of. The apartment is in great walking distance from Pike's Market and the surrounding neighborhood has some fun cafes to explore, definitely a great place to stay in Seattle!"
3959442,35560881,2015-06-20,13621963,Patrick,My wife and I needed a place in capital hill and this place definitely made our stay more enjoyable than we imagined.  She greeted us and even allowed us to check in a bit earlier.  The place is cozy and felt like a home away from home.  We were able to walk everywhere and felt comfortable with the walk home after the day's events.  We didn't need much from our wonderful host but she left a nice portfolio of things to do and enjoy around Seattle and capital hill.  Would definitely look into this place again if needed!
3959442,36534027,2015-06-29,12457387,Paulina,"My parents and I are repeat customers. This place is fantastic and works really well for us. It's impeccably clean, cozy, and has everything my parents needed for their 6-day stay. Rebecca is very friendly and responsive. Highly recommended!"
3959442,37286391,2015-07-06,11252426,Pierre,"Thank you Rebecca! The neighborhood is lovely, the apartment is cute and convenient, we enjoyed to be there."
3959442,38111519,2015-07-13,2919804,Raul,"We had a great time in Seattle! The studio was just as described, beautiful and has an amazing location. Thank you Rebecca! "
3959442,38421163,2015-07-15,33920502,Emily,Rebecca's place was incredible! So impeccably clean yet warm and inviting at the same time. The perfect spot for my boyfriend and I to rest while we explored the city. Plus Rebecca was very flexible with check-in and her recommendations were so helpful. Would definitely recommend a stay here!
3959442,39380809,2015-07-23,2700231,Steven,"Rebecca's studio was perfect for our week long stay and I'm already missing Seattle. Her discription was exactly how we pictured it, when you enter you can see everything from the bed to the kitchen and even a small table with two chairs to have a lovely dinner. The studio was a well hidden gem away from the main street, you heard some noise but not a lot. After our third day I preferred staying in the area compared to going to downtown, the neighborhood was perfect walking distance for food and ice cream. If you still want to explore a lot of the bus stops are within walking distance and it still only takes you 30 minutes to get any of the other neighborhoods. I would definitely come back and stay with Rebecca because of the prime location her studio offers. Thank you!"
3959442,39672946,2015-07-25,6732336,Pamela,"Rebecca was very welcoming to us. The studio is small but wonderfully laid out so it doesn't feel small. It was spotlessly clean  and although we didn't cook, there was a full kitchen with a sweet table for two that we would have happily used. The studio is close to many of the sites of Seattle all within a 30 minute walk, but it was so quiet at night I wouldn't have known I was in the city. Rebecca was available if we had questions. We really enjoyed the studio and would certainly stay there again."
3959442,40086362,2015-07-28,7803635,Jon,"Everything with the apartment was as described and the neighborhood is nice and low key, but still walking distance to the Capitol Hill bustle."
3959442,40730712,2015-08-02,2800928,Eric,"This was by far my best air bnb experience. I loved the apartment- modern, simple, clean, comfortable, quiet and in a great location. Rebecca was an excellent host in all ways. I couldn't recommend staying here more. "
3959442,42406968,2015-08-13,2011415,Sarah,"We arrived to Seattle earlier than expected, but Rebecca graciously met us as soon as she could. The neighborhood is so lovely and the little apartment was great. It was very clean and perfect for a short stay--great location for seeing Seattle. We were in town during a particularly hot summer; Rebecca provided us with a fan, but the nights were still quite warm. "
3959442,43384730,2015-08-19,4878932,Jason,"Rebecca was such a gracious and generous host, we felt very welcome. The apartment is just as listed, in a great location, bright and airy. We had a wonderful visit. Trader Joes!"
3959442,44120265,2015-08-24,35633431,Jill,"Rebecca's studio is perfect! The coziest home away from home I've ever stayed in! (Actually cozier than my home). Ha. Love the decor, and the location is amazing. You can walk everywhere you need to go! The waterfront is about 30 min downhill. Like she says in the listing, i also recommend taking the bus back up the hill. It's only $2.50, and much cheaper than parking. Walking back up the hill is fun, but def a workout. :) 

I didn't get to meet Rebecca during my stay, but she was available via text if I had any questions.  After this trip, my wishing to move to Seattle/Capital Hill is def turning into planning! Thanks, Rebecca!

PS. Beware: The bed is so cozy you will never want to leave. "
3959442,44695795,2015-08-28,334487,Samantha,"Staying at the modern studio was lovely. It's clean, quiet, light-filled and comfortable. I slept like a baby in the queen-sized bed and really enjoyed the summer cross-breeze coming from the open windows at night. 

The location is great. I walked to Central Co-op on my first day to stock up on groceries and cooked most of my meals on the trip myself. Getting to Capitol Hill on foot was super easy, and on the day I reserved a Zipcar, parking in the neighborhood was not a problem. 

I didn't actually meet Rebecca in-person since I checked-in when she was away and was out and about myself most of the time, but all of my interactions with her were very pleasant and timely. 

I would happily come back!"
3959442,45265486,2015-09-01,37835816,Lisa Anne,Rebecca ensured we had all of the information we needed prior to our arrival in order to arrive with ease.  The description of the studio was very accurate--very cute and CLEAN place.  GREAT location!  We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit and the neighborhood was very nice.
3959442,45675499,2015-09-05,36818047,Cormac,"We spent 4 nights in this wonderful studio and it was everything we needed. It's nice and cosy and within walking distance of all the major sights. Rebecca was a great host, always making sure we were comfortable and that we had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this place!"
3959442,46367784,2015-09-10,32231657,Ashley,"The Modern Studio in Seattle was the perfect location for my husband and me to visit the city for the first time. The Studio was neat, welcoming, and looked as nice as the pictures do. It also had all of the amenities we needed. The location allowed us to walk or use public transportation to get around downtown without the hassle of driving and finding parking. We enjoyed a few local neighborhood restaurants and shops near the studio thanks to Rebecca's awesome recommendations. Rebecca was attentive if we ever had questions or needed help. We are extremely grateful for our stay in this beautiful city and we can't wait to go back!"
3959442,47031925,2015-09-15,32575530,Howard,Fantastic stay.  Sorted out trip really easily.  Rebecca was great and happy to help sort out anything we needed help with.  The flat is in a really nice location in close proximity to the city. You could walk or grab a bus or Uber.  The apartment is very nice and cosy.  Highly recommended.
3959442,48175312,2015-09-24,4539240,Josette & Joost,"We found Rebecca's apartment was as cozy as it looks in the pictures! The bed turned out to be very comfortable too. The apartment was in a quiet location, and perfect for exploring the Capitol Hill area (which we thought was the nicest area anyway!). For other areas we usually took a bus there or back, which wasn't always so straight forward, but later on we also used Uber, which worked really well. It was a nice touch to have a spare umbrella and shopping bag provided by Rebecca, we used both! "
3959442,50083579,2015-10-09,42395432,Sonya,"The studio was the perfect place to call home while we visited lovely Seattle. All of our needs were anticipated, and we enjoyed the cozy, clean and peaceful accommodation. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen and bathroom functioned well. Also, the location can't be beat. Quiet residential area but within walking distance to many attractions. Because we are chemically sensitive, we appreciated the mild soaps and cleaners that were used to clean the place and available for our use.  Thank you Rebecca!"
3959442,51927486,2015-10-25,2774392,Peter,"Rebecca was great. Met us at the studio right on time and was always in communication before and during our stay.  

Very nice place, spotless. We appreciated the off site parking given that it is difficult to park during the day in the neighborhood.  Central district is a hop, skip and a jump to everything we needed.  

I only got to page 179 of Malcom Gladwell's ""David and Goliath"" that was left in the studio so I guess I will have to return to finish!

Highly recommended.  

Peter and Ellen Hollis"
3959442,52822746,2015-11-02,40250334,Jayson,"I had a wonderful stay. Worth the money 100%. In a really great part of town. A little bit away for the hustle and bustle so it's easy to relax, but not but a 15-20 minute walk to anything you want to see from Capitol Hill to downtown!"
3959442,53450243,2015-11-09,2574318,Lacy,"A tiny, cozy apartment in a fantastic neighborhood. I was attending a conference at the convention center and this spot could not have been more perfect. I hope to have a reason to be in Seattle again soon and to stay in this great location.  "
3959442,54100822,2015-11-16,27913956,Christina,"Rebecca's home was extremely clean and had everything that we needed. She met us beforehand and gave us a quick tour and had everything regarding the house/rules laid out in a small binder for us. Her place is in a very nice neighborhood that is conveniently located near several restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Her place was accurately described on her listing. Everything was very comfortable while we stayed there - I would definitely come back! Thank you Rebecca!"
3959442,54899098,2015-11-25,8670230,Emily,"Rebecca was a breeze to communicate with and her lovely home is located right where you want to be to see the best of Seattle! My mentee who stayed in the listing is now in love with the city and determined to move there, so Rebecca's doing it right! "
3959442,55370289,2015-12-01,7449838,Drew,Great stay in a great location. The studio was perfect and Rebecca was easy to communicate with.
3959442,55942696,2015-12-07,48775680,Alexi,The description of this studio was exactly how it was in person: so clean and quaint! It was the perfect location to sight see all over Seattle for the first time. Lovely neighborhood and host! Everything about staying here was easy and pleasant! I'm already trying to plan my next visit! Thank you!!!!
3959442,56667323,2015-12-16,26636858,Mary,"Rebecca's studio was a very comfortable place to stay and a very convenient location for walking to Capitol Hill. Rebecca thought of so many details and provided instructions about everything and places to keep everything (hooks for coats, plenty of space to hang things in the bathroom, plastic containers to keep leftovers in the refrigerator). Rebecca was easy to communicate with. I hope I get the opportunity to return someday."
3959442,56983319,2015-12-20,2624225,Inkar,"Great experience at Rebecca's place. Really loved the short walk to all of the restaurants, coffeeshops, and bars nearby. Beautiful, quaint neighborhood. The place was very clean and had everything you needed for a comfortable stay. "
3959442,57515599,2015-12-27,45674808,Chris,"Rebecca's studio apartment was exactly as billed.  It was exactly what we needed, and Rebecca was a great help by being available for a late arrival.  We will definitely consider this spot for future visits."
4672934,24775393,2015-01-02,24986578,Dana,Really fantastic townhouse in a great location.  We stayed for NYE and were so close to tons of nightlife in Ballard.  The house was a perfect size for two couples to stay comfortably and the owner made the whole experience really easy. Would definitely stay again!
4672934,26692071,2015-02-17,25964574,Ashli,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle and Steven was a great host. He was extremely organized and available even while traveling if we had any questions (although he had a gDocs spreadsheet with all the information we could possibly want so we never needed him!). 

The townhouse is in a great location close to downtown Seattle and within walking distance to many shops, restaurants, bars and grocery stores.

We would definitely stay again!"
4672934,28881760,2015-03-31,23589028,Kirren,"I booked this house of behalf of some clients of mine who were doing some work In Seattle. They thoroughly enjoyed their stay, loved the place and the location was very convenient for them. Steve was very fast at responding to my emails and made the booking process very easy. "
4672934,29839974,2015-04-13,28623408,Paul,The listing was just as described and Steven was very helpful with all questions both leading up to and during our stay. 
4672934,31315002,2015-05-04,9746382,Beth,"We had a great stay in Ballard at Steven's house. The house was well-equipped, clean, and very comfortable. It was also conveniently located close to downtown Ballard. I would definitely recommend it!"

Great communication with owner - he was very attentive and accessible during our stay.
Nice location too!"
4672934,41790179,2015-08-09,23872487,Manda,Steven saved the day for me! I was getting married and the place me and my party were going to get ready had an emergency. Steven was the only person who was got me back and helped me out. He was the best host ever and his place was amazing. Steven is the best and the nicest person ever. He really did save the day for the wedding. I am so grateful for everything. Thank you so much Steven you are an amazing person!

4672934,49719275,2015-10-05,10237871,Rochelle,The location was very convenient to cute neighborhoods but away enough to have adequate street parking. The place was spotless and clean and very comfortable. I would stay here again. 
4672934,51355104,2015-10-19,13136838,Sarahjoy,Was a great stay in Seattle! Was only there for one night but the house was perfect. Very technologically up to date and it was especially nice to not have to have a key because of the keypad lock. Steven was great and provided lots of information on both the home and the area.

5123904,27882754,2015-03-14,27612646,Erin,"We couldn't believe our luck to have found such a wonderful place.  We stayed for a week with the adorable house to ourselves in a fantastic neighborhood. It was great to be able to use the back patio and walk/run to the nearby parks,restaurants, and shops. Emily made us feel at home, she left a note with 'how to's' for the house and recommendations of things to do. We had everything we needed to cook at home, which saved us a bundle. The soap, shampoo and conditioner were really helpful. We also worked a lot from the kitchen area, and all the windows and natural light were really pleasant. "
5123904,28099579,2015-03-17,4871807,Judi,"Emily was a fantastic hostess.  She offered assistance with booking, restaurants, and anything additional she could help with.  The house was in a wonderful neighborhood - a great place to go for a walk.  The older home was perfect for our family of 3.  The only thing that would have made for a better stay would have been to have window coverings on the bedroom windows, especially on the ground floor/basement bedroom.  "
5123904,28559169,2015-03-26,8798762,Kelsey,"I'd love to stay at Emily & Kyle's place again. Emily was very helpful & friendly in communications prior to our stay. Upon arrival, we felt very welcomed with clear instructions/information about the home and neighborhood. And what a lovely neighborhood it is; I loved walking through it. We were in walking distance to a great park, the zoo, and various restaurants. The photos of the home are spot-on. There's a lot of natural light, and the convenience of a full kitchen to cook in made our stay even more comfortable. Wish we had a few more days there!"
5123904,29549661,2015-04-09,835282,Aimie,"the host is very welcoming, accommodating and responded to my questions fast."
5123904,30127795,2015-04-18,6271644,Sarah,Nice house- basic furnishings but comfortable. Emily left us a bottle of wine (so sweet!) Nice decks- but too cold while we were there to enjoy. Great location. Would stay there again. 
5123904,30796447,2015-04-27,514097,Cherie,"Emily was so great with communication! The house was perfect and in the most cutest neighborhood. A quiet residential area, but close to everything we needed! I would definitely recommend it!"
5123904,33894747,2015-06-02,8964255,Charles,Thank you Emily and Kyle. Your Craftsman home was perfect for visiting and entertaining our Seattle children. Our first grandson was born during this stay and will make it all the more memorable. The kitchen and dining were spacious for my cooking needs. The street was wonderfully quiet. I hope to return to your wonderful place on my next visit to Seattle.
5123904,37680968,2015-07-09,1916301,Scott & Shayla,"Great little house in a cool part of Seattle.  Emily and Kyle were very communicative and super helpful with all our needs and questions.  The house is walkable to everything you need (Coffee, bars, pizza and an unbelievably delicious pie shop!!!)  "
5123904,39880582,2015-07-26,12424870,Aclan,"Great place! Easy to find and close to a lot of excellent rsstaurants and cafes! 5-10 min to downtown, 2 min to Ballard and Fremont! Would stay again, excellent hosts! Clean house, easy check-in and out!! Thank you"
5123904,42411436,2015-08-13,37088799,Claire,Emily and Kyle's house was wonderful!  It was clean and looked exactly like the pictures and was in a great neighborhood.  Emily was very responsive when I had a question.  I would definitely recommend Emily and Kyle's house!
103466,1156478,2012-04-20,2109428,Diana & Enoch,"Sarah and Ryan's cottage was perfect for us. The location is ideal--Phinney Ridge is the best Seattle neighborhood, hands down. Walking distance to parks, zoo, cafes and boutiques, a quick bike ride to Fremont or Ballard, and just a short drive to downtown or the freeway. Street parking was no problem and the adorable retro-modern cottage was just what we needed for a little Seattle retreat with our preschool aged daughter. The in-room washer and dryer were also very handy! Communicating with Sarah and Ryan was quick and easy, they were great hosts and we hope to return again another day. "
103466,1203857,2012-04-30,837364,Koesmanto,"When I booked Sarah's cottage, I had some idea on what to expect but when we got there, oh my, the place exceeded my expectation.

There were 4 of us staying at Sarah's cottage - me, my wife, a 19 month old and a 2 month old - and it was amazing. The amenities at her place are great: fridge, kitchen, washer and dryer (a lifesaver with 2 babies), and many more.

Her ""Welcome"" list was also great. We frequented a lot of her recommended restaurants. And best of all? The park and the zoo are only 2 blocks away!

I cannot recommend Sarah's cottage highly enough. We will for sure come back again when we visit Seattle next."
103466,1419839,2012-06-05,1734472,Shealeen,"We stayed here 2 weekends in a row and are glad we chose this place for 3 reasons: 1) best location ever!, 2)clean & accommodating, 3) perfect with two young kids (3&5).  

Location:  walking distance to kens market, zoo, playground, & lots of restaurants (mae's- great or breakfast, Wingdome & Phinney market cafe)

Clean & accommodating: white towels, fluffy pillows, comfy bed & pull out couch, air purifier for noise, Kleenex, TP, PT, soap, detergent for walking machine, pots, pans, plates, coffee, tricycle, etc .Could go on & on!  

Kids:  both kids slept on pullout couch.  Put cushions on ground in case 3 yr old rolled out & it was perfect!  Washer & dryer for messy kids!  Tricycle in yard for them to ride on.  Park is 2 blocks away as is zoo.  Phinney market restaurant nearby with train table, books & games for kids & yummy food like salmon, lentils & friend asparagus with lemon aioli and great wines & beers.
"
103466,1455265,2012-06-11,2113237,Mariela,"Sarah and her husband were great hosts!  Beautiful cottage and convenient location to bars, restaurants and grocery store...all within walking distance.    I really appreciated the kitchen space because I love to cook!    Thanks again and I invite anyone who's thinking of visiting Seattle to stay here -- driving distance to downtown and close to public transportation.  Great for those visiting family and friends."
103466,1491726,2012-06-16,2178828,Taryn,"We stayed for a work week at the little private cottage.  I was in town for a business trip, and my husband and baby were there for fun with friends.  The hosts were wonderful...always available and really nice, but we rarely saw them.  We also really enjoyed playing with their dog, Rio.  The place is immaculate and very smartly layed out and decorated.  They have done an excellent job with this space making it light and airy, but also very cozy.  We really enjoyed playing records on the record player, but also appreciated being able to plug in our computer to the sound system.  For me especially, having the wifi was crucial, and it worked perfectly.  On our way to the place, we stopped at PCC in Fremont and stocked up on breakfast and dinner items.  At night we used the grill and made some lovely dinners. They had everything we needed in the kitchen.  My husband was really able to take advantage of the location: they walked to the zoo and the Phinney Market, and ventured further down to Fremont.  It is a great location.  For me, the access to the highways was great.  I was able to zip all over Seattle and out to the Eastside very quickly.  Parking was always a breeze.  I either parked right in front or on the ajacent street without ever having any trouble at all.  There was plenty of room to put all of our stuff, even in the bathroom.  It is just a really lovely, relaxing space.  I highly recommend it.  We can't wait to stay there again!"
103466,1573937,2012-06-27,2146364,Amy,"Remarkably quiet and private for being near a commercial area. As noted by others, the cottage has everything you need, from salt and pepper to a hair dryer. Also, unlike many hotels I have stayed in, the bed and pillows are very comfortable. Even the pull out couch was more comfortable than most. Very fun and cozy. Great for those who want a home away from home."
103466,1610183,2012-07-02,2345618,Sophie,"the place was clean, comfortable and included all the amenities you might need. It was in a great location."
103466,1689365,2012-07-12,1746244,Lori,"Quiet, clean, cozy and wonderful....and close to great shops and restaurants."
103466,1709724,2012-07-15,2208778,Courtney,Sarah was very friendly and accommodating. We loved her space and the neighborhood.
103466,1817769,2012-07-28,2107779,Aj,"This review is in response to the review that was posted about me and my husband. 
1. The cottage is cute and cozy
2. The ""private cottage"" that is advertised is not at all private. Just know that you share a small outdoor space with a family and dog. We assumed that ""private"" meant that it would be ok if we had our close family come by to meet and spend time with their twin 8 month old grandchildren during daylight hours. As their bedtime is 7-8pm, there would be no activity after that time other than possibly a quiet conversation in what was advertised as our ""private space"". And let it be known, we spent 90% of our awake time away from the cottage.
3. A friend left a dog over for 2 hours outside. Our bad, we should have read the house rules more carefully. On the topic of dogs, their ""young, friendly and cute dog"" is certainly young and cute, however, not at all friendly. Be aware that you could walk out of your private cottage and get jumped on by an out of control dog. Scary to say the least when you've got an 8 month old in your arms.
4. Damage to the counters? Aren't kitchen counters supposed to be resilient enough for normal every day use? We scrubbed the kitchen more than once a day due to the infestation of fruit flies (garborator?). My advice to Sarah and Ryan is to write out specific instructions on how to care for your delicate counters. 
5. Not appropriate for a family of small children. Bedroom is small with no door, so you're pretty much forced to stay either outside or in the bedroom when kids are alseep. 
6. May not be appropriate for a nice couple with twins, but definitely appropriate for a single dog trainer, they could definitely use some help with that very un-trained dog.
My biggest beef with these owners was that they had PLENTY of opportunity to reiterate the rules to us. We are very respectful and easy going people. At any point during our 2 week stay, they could have easily talked to us rationally and clarify the rules. Instead, we left this rental, said goodbye to the owners without so much as a negative word aimed our way. Not the friendliest bunch but definitely did not confront us with any problems. Be warned, you get home from your stay in this ""private cottage"" and find a nasty, unfounded review written about you. Not pleasant. Not accurate. Just be warned. Good luck Sarah and Ryan! Not quite sure if house renting is your calling. "
103466,1911512,2012-08-07,2274633,Jean,"From the street, the cottage is NOT seen.  As you open the door of this private cottage, you are more than pleased with the spotlessness of this cosey 'home'.  
Everything inside is brand new and fresh and comfortable.  
Sarah has provided everything that you need for a visit.  Additionally, she is very cordial.
This cottage is perfect for your stay in the Seattle area.  The #5 bus to downtown is about 100 yards from your front door.
The next time that I need housing while visiting Seattle, I will be calling upon the ""private cottage in phinney ridge"".
Thanks Sarah."
103466,2062309,2012-08-22,2109743,Eli,"Beautiful cottage, great neighborhood, and better kitchen appliances than you yourself may own.  We just spent a week there, and wouldn't stay any other place in Seattle.  A week's worth of good local food from Ken's Market up the street, and you're set for a week of good dinner parties.  And if you're lucky, and so inclined, they may just have some locals over to their place, providing you with a perfect opportunity to hang out with some good Seattlites (alas, we were far too drunk to imbibe further)."
103466,2550187,2012-10-08,3718432,Margot,"We stayed for a long weekend. It was incredibly convenient, quiet and everything functioned perfectly. The kitchen was well equipped to cook in and there was plenty of space for 4 people (adults) for one night when we had visitors using the pull out couch. Highly recommended! "
103466,2751318,2012-10-29,3841970,Barbara,"Everything was as promised, and more.  The cottage is well equipped, tight from the weather (and we did have some weather), warm and comfortable.  The location, close to public transportation and a variety of restaurants, is great.  Seems like a very nice neighborhood, good for walking.  The interior finishing and all the furnishings seem quite new (Ikea, perhaps?), although the cottage itself is obviously old and charming.  "
103466,2868944,2012-11-12,4019734,Russell,"Our stay was great!  We never actually did meet Sarah but we did see their cute puppy through the window a couple of times.  The cottage was a perfect size, large enough to host a small dinner but small enough to keep tidy easily.  The bed was probably the most comfortable thing I've slept on in years (and I have $1400 memory foam mattress at home!).  Everything was clean upon arrival, the internet worked great and you couldn't ask for a better location.  Plus the singed Shepard Fairey poster was a nice surprise!  At last I would like to address the person who left a surprisingly negative review.  To anyone reading this don't let that review sway your mind about this place.  I think some people just don't quite read well enough to fully understand the situation, and then don't communicate very well when they're unhappy.  I look forward to staying here again!"
103466,3008151,2012-12-02,4059758,Claudia,"We had a great stay at Sarah & Ryan's cottage. My family and I were relocating to Seattle and needed a cozy, friendly place to stay while we waited for our permanent home to be ready. My mom, my son and I stayed in the cottage for 3 weeks and we had a great experience. We were in a centrally located, walkable neighborhood, the cottage was well stocked so we could cook meals and wash our clothes without having to find a laundromat. Sarah & Ryan gave us neighborhood information to familiarize us with the shops, markets and restaurants in Phinney Ridge. It was really nice to have internet access also. We had our privacy, but knew that they were available if we had questions. So much better than staying in a hotel! Now that we're settled into our new neighborhood, we still visit Phinney Ridge favorites (like A la Mode Pies - yum). Thanks to Sarah & Ryan for making us feel at home for our first few weeks in Seattle."
103466,3336065,2013-01-13,3382997,Ja,"We had a blast! The house had all the amenities as described, and then some. Very comfortable, clean, and quiet. Loved the neighboorhood, especially Green Lake and its surrounding trails. Bus access was also exceptional -- getting downtown was very easy & affordable. And the kitchen appliances/gadgets were an added bonus (much better than expected). Thanks, Sarah & Ryan!  "
103466,3361706,2013-01-17,9701,Brian,"The cottage was a perfect place for us.  The bed was really comfortable. The place was very quiet. The Kitchen was fully stocked, very modern and clean.  Tons of channels on the TV.  We loved the keyless door lock.  Most places you have to deal with the key exchange, but the cottage has a keyless door lock that you just punch in the code and its unlocked! The location was perfect.  5 minute walk to green lake, food and coffee all around the neighborhood. "
103466,3639426,2013-02-26,5124581,Toni,"We had an amazing stay. The cottage was more than we expected and Sarah and her family were all so nice to us. They let us extend our stay at the very last minute. Me and my boyfriend got back one afternoon and we found flowers and a card from them because we were staying in Seattle due to a death in my family. We both thank them and cant wait till we come o town again since we know exactly where we will be going to stay.
Toni and Bryan"
103466,3676321,2013-03-03,4768758,Melanie,"A very comfortable, quiet and nicely furnished cottage at the rear of their property.  The hostess provided many unexpected amenities including  extra blankets, pillows, a variety of condiments, pancake mix, milk, waters,  laundry and bathing supplies, and much more making  it easy to feel right at home.  There was a wide variety of records to select music from, several movies, as well as books to peruse.  Accessing the Wifi was very easy and convenient, as was viewing just about any television programming one could hope for.  The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, cookware, full size fridge and  glass top stove and microwave.  The bedroom, although small held a very comfortable queen bed with luxuriously soft, warm coverings.  It was an overall lovely cottage, with very warm and personable hosts, including Rio the dog, who once he knew you were friendly was easily approachable.   I highly recommend the Cottage for a single person or couple looking to stay in a convenient neighborhood."
103466,3767797,2013-03-12,19995,Sarah,"I highly recommend Sarah & Ryan's cottage for a stay in Seattle. For our group of two couples and a baby---they kindly provided a pack 'n play---the space was cozy but not cramped. (The bathroom is surprisingly large. Nice!) The cottage was thoughtfully decorated, very comfortable, and stocked with everything we needed. We especially appreciated having a full kitchen, although the house is in a great family-friendly neighborhood with plenty of restaurants. Check-in was a breeze. A lovely, convenient home base!"
103466,3822767,2013-03-18,5270413,Carol,"The cottage had everything we needed!  So much better than a hotel or even a B&B.  We could come and go as we pleased without bothering anyone else, had complete privacy and could cook our own meals.  Bed was comfy and the place was spotless."
103466,3864231,2013-03-22,4418610,Kevin,Sarah and Ryan's cottage was outstanding.  It was a very comfortable spot that is conveniently located.  it was spotless with all the amenities of home.  We would highly recommend. 
103466,4121153,2013-04-11,5696422,Nick,"Sarah's place in Phinney Ridge was awesome!  She was nice enough to let us check-in a little early also.  The place is exactly as advertised- clean, efficient, and in a cool neighborhood.  The bus stop is just up the street at the corner which made it really convenient for us.  All of the accommodations were comfortable and practical, I even did a couple loads of laundry while I was there.  The cottage feels very comfortable and roomy.  There were just two of us that stayed there, but it would easily accommodate a couple more or a few kids just fine.  Sarah was easy to communicate with, mainly through text or airbnb messages, she responded quickly and had everything ready for us.  I would definitely stay again and highly recommend Sarah's cottage to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Seattle."
103466,4174217,2013-04-15,1143698,Andrew,"I'm not sure that you could find better accommodations in Seattle for the price or a more responsive proprietor than Sarah.  The cottage is perfectly situated in one of Seattle's finest neighborhoods and was ideal for our purposes.  It was also a refreshing delight to be able to leave the car parked for the entire weekend.  We will stay here every time we return to town so long as it's available.  Thank you, Sarah."
103466,4248840,2013-04-22,5420087,Hannah,"Sarah's cottage was clean, nicely decorated, and super comfortable to stay in! We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend this place."
103466,4458463,2013-05-06,5990389,Justin And Meaghin,"Have you ever walked through the ""show spaces"" in an Ikea store? This cottage feels just like one of those spaces: well-designed, thoughtfully laid out, cohesively comforting. There's not a travel accessory that hasn't been thought of, even down to a lint roller! I was particularly a fan of the record player and small LP collection. 

The Phinney Ridge location can't be beat. It's a quick jaunt over to Green Lake park for a beautiful 3 mile running trail, and a short distance to Fremont and Ballard. There's a bakery at the end of the block with Stumptown for a morning pick-me-up. 

The only downside is that the cottage has some fairly thin walls, which means that nearby noise can filter in pretty easily. But compared to the door-banging of a hotel hallway, it's downright monastic. "
103466,5436136,2013-06-30,6666613,Klaus,We  had a wonderful stay and can recommend the cottage! It accommodates 4 however there is only space for two at the kitchen counter. But nice places for breakfast and dinner close by! Quiet neighborhood and a lake nearby makes it a perfect spot for sports but also to explore Seattle and surroundings. We would choose it again!
103466,5882429,2013-07-21,1207133,Kimberly,"The cottage was cozy, clean and in a great neighborhood.  It was a little smaller than we thought and was tight for 2 couples but we are good friends so that didn't matter.   We didn't get to meet Sonal as they had just moved in.   It is a bit of a trek to the city,but a very quiet neighborhood, full of gardens, great architecture and cute cafes. "
103466,6045097,2013-07-28,6276634,Nate,We were very pleased with our stay. The host was more than accommodating (1 year old stuff) and made our stay that much better. I would highly recommend staying in this location. We plan on staying here every time we make the trip.
103466,6239196,2013-08-05,6475297,Kim,"We had a wonderful stay at this centrally located, QUIET unit. Private entrance for us so we could come and go as we please. Met the owners on the last day and they were very nice and accommodating. The place was perfect for the four of us (all adults) and we will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Seattle.

Coffee, pub, restaurants all within walking distance. Everything we wanted to see was within a 10-20 minute car ride. Best part was Green lake (great place to run/walk/enjoy some seattle beauty) was 2 blocks away. We enjoyed our Saturday morning walk around the lake. We weren't in the unit long enough to cook or use the kitchen because there were so many great spots to eat and try."
103466,6341153,2013-08-09,6152061,Stephie,"We had a great experience here! Location is ideal and the accommodations were as explained and perfect for our needs. We found everything we needed - kitchen tools, linens, etc. We were amazed at how quiet the cottage is. We did not here noise from the street or from the main house at all. We hope to stay here again!"
103466,6454519,2013-08-13,5821266,Todd,"Great neighborhood with lots of Seattle charm--beautiful housing stock and abundant gardens overflowing from many a parkway;  a full market a minute's drive away; lovely park with playground just down the street at the entrance of the Seattle zoo. The unit was clean and comfortable, with a fully equipped kitchen and convenient washer/dryer. Sonal was welcoming and seemed nice!"
103466,7191580,2013-09-10,5195750,David,"Sonal's place is really quiet and in a great location, close to a number of good restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.   Since we were spending much of our time with family in the area, we didn't get a chance to meet Sonal in person.   However, she was very responsive via email and helped us with special requests.   "
103466,7943697,2013-10-09,2274633,Jean,"The cottage in Phinney is perfect for me.  It's clean and comfortable.  Lovely living room, kitchen, comfy bedroom and very, very clean bath room.  I love the shower!

Sonal and her husband were EXTREMELY PATIENT when I called to say that I LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF THE COTTAGE.  They came from a family event, patiently and reopened.  The cottage.

This was the second time that I stayed at the cottage...AND, I'll be back... The cottage is less than 1 mile from my grandson.

See you again.  And, thanks..."
103466,8014495,2013-10-12,1212520,Jeremy And Rachael,"Sonal was quick to reply and confirm our reservation request - THANK YOU!  The little cottage is perfect - quiet, clean, well appointed, and just what we needed for the two of us.  The Queen sized bed is very comfortable, even if it does make the bedroom a bit tight to move around in.  Our luggage needed to stay in the living room area, but that wasn't an issue for us, and we were delighted to find that a short walk...5 minutes or less) was all that was needed to reach several great bakeries, pubs, markets, and restaurants.

Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Sonal's cottage is clean, quiet, well stocked, and a great in-city retreat for a traveling single or couple.  "
103466,8637667,2013-11-10,5550258,Arden,"The Phinney cottage was a great home base for my recent visit to North Seattle. Great neighborhood near parks and Green Lake. The space was private, clean, cozy, comfortable and blissfully quiet.  Nice open living/kitchen space. The bedroom was a little tight and had limited storage space but the bed was very comfy!  I was thankful for the washer/dryer with a longer stay. The bathroom was larger than expected with good storage...shower was great, quality towels. 

Sonal and Mark are gracious and responsive hosts.  I'll definitely consider for future visits and recommend to others. "
103466,8844849,2013-11-21,956799,Philip,"We were travelling with a 2 year old so this review will try to comment on that. Overall, the place was great, about 10-15 minute drive to Seattle proper. Street parking was never a problem (we often parked right in front of the house or the house next door). Very clean, modern and well heated/light. It was also very nice and quiet in side. 

Our 2 year old really enjoyed our trip. This place was only about 10 minutes from all the great attractions for kids. Eating at the nearby restaurants was also great and Sonal provided us with a nice little basket of menus from local places that I could walk to to pick up dinner. It's also a block away from the zoo. Which was great for us!

One caveat is that there's no door on the bedroom, though there is a curtain. The unit could easily sleep two couples but you'd hear everything. The bedroom is also super small so if you're bringing a pack-n-play the little ones will have to sleep in the tv room. This wasn't a problem for us though, but ymmv. 

Overall we loved it and would gladly stay again. "
103466,9061937,2013-12-03,748769,Joe,"Loved the cottage, well furnished, well equipped kitchen, nice linens!  Good location!  Will definitely stay again!

Jeanne and Joe"
103466,9147467,2013-12-09,4658520,David,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful cottage. It was freezing cold in Seattle, but once the heating had warmed the place up it became the perfect place to retreat from the cold. It is comfortable, well laid out, and worked well with our 2 1/2 year old."
103466,9402721,2013-12-27,5701375,Judy,We definitely liked our stay there.  Would go back.  The bakery across Phinney Ave. was wonderful.
103466,9548442,2014-01-02,3924979,Kathleen,Great place to stay in a great neighborhood. Lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance plus it's close to the zoo and Green Lake. The guest cottage was perfect and it was hassle free to set up details of our arrival.
103466,9721371,2014-01-06,10719993,Derek,"My now wife and I spent the night before, and of, our wedding here.  We really enjoyed the place.  It was super clean, very well equipped/stocked, access was easy, fairly priced, and it was super cozy.  Recommended!"
103466,10037334,2014-01-27,2629309,Celine,"Sonal and Mark's Phinney Ridge cottage was our home base for a 4-day seminar in Greenlake, and could not have been more perfect. - Cozy in a good way, with good space for two. Wonderfully peaceful & quiet, extremely private even though just a few feet from their door. 
- No 'conveniences of home' are overlooked - from appliances to linens to dish soap - and spotlessly clean. As another guest commented, we felt like we were in staying in our own personal Ikea showroom (minus the awful lights and meatballs).
- Location is excellent - easy parking, short lazy walk to restaurants, stores, parks. If you stay, there, don't miss Fresh Flours cafe on the corner, and A La Mode pie shop a block away.
- You can tell in a minute that Sonal and Mark genuinely hope you enjoy your stay. Friendly, super responsive- so happy to have randomly met Mark as we were leaving. 
We're looking forward to staying there again :) "
103466,10335150,2014-02-14,5550258,Arden,Last month I had my second stay at the Phinney Cottage and it was really terrific again.  I will be happy to return in the future and recommend to others who want a quiet and cozy setting in a charming Seattle neighborhood. 
103466,10468554,2014-02-20,828615,Karlee,"I'm not sure I had add anything that hasn't already been said. This is a wonderful place with a great location. We stayed several days with our 3 1/2 year old daughter. We enjoyed being able to walk to Greenlake, the zoo, and many cafés/restaurants. It was a short drive to any other parts if Seattle we wanted to see. 

The place itself was a great size for 2 adults & one child. We loved being able to go to the grocery stores and come back to prepare meals. It was also great to have the washer & dryer since this was a longer trip for us. 

This was only our second time using air bnb. Both experiences have been flawless. I'm not sure I can stay in a hotel again!"
103466,10658780,2014-03-02,11149325,Greg,"My summary: Great quiet rental for the price in a very pleasant neighborhood and with an eager to please host. More: Enjoyed a week-long stay in this quiet, warm apartment. Host is great and clearly attentive to details. Very nice too. The neighborhood is just what I hoped, with a few great restaurants and shops nearby (e.g. Phinney Market, Fresh Flours coffee and pastries), as well as the great park/lake. Also very close to the bus line downtown, which I used daily. 

The experience was more like a boutique hotel and less like a spare building turned into an inn. This situation seems to be evolving room by room; the kitchen, living and bath are very nice, and very much as they should be for this price. Where I might be less complementary is in the bedroom: I prefer a stiff mattress to a very soft one, but the mattress here was on the very soft end of my firmness spectrum.  

I was very comfortable here but readers should know this apartment is not new construction. Much of it has been renovated and is new, but expect a few quirks like slightly wavy floors and dated heating. Be sure the heating works great, but it is not centrally controlled. Most things are well maintained and I got the sense that the host pursues continuous improvement, so look for my nitpicks to fade from user reviews in time. "
103466,10808633,2014-03-08,12761483,Kate,"A wonderful place to stay for my family! It was comfortable and quiet, and in a terrific central location. Arranging the stay was easy as the host responded quickly to all questions. "
103466,11324753,2014-03-30,1585497,Teresa,"Loved this place!  The location was perfect and convenient.  I could walk to Green Lake and coffee was less than a block away.  The place was clean, modern, peaceful and quiet, and I was able to get in and out without even seeing the hosts, who were always available when I needed them and so friendly when I did happen to run into them.  The place had everything I needed and more."
103466,11560375,2014-04-07,457936,Eva,"Our stay at Sonal's place was great! The cottage was adorable, easy and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and we appreciated that there were things like spices and oil for cooking so we didn't have to purchase. Our son was very comfy on the fold-out couch and he loved the Netflix available on the TV. Location was great for walking around and close-by amenities and also easy access by car to 99 for visiting other parts of the city.  Sonal was a terrific hostess and responded super-quickly when we needed something. We'd definitely stay at Sonal's place again!"
103466,12010205,2014-04-21,365239,Jenny,"Cute place! Compact and simple but fit our needs perfectly.
Thanks Sonal!!"
103466,12295682,2014-04-28,13833204,Holly,"My parents stayed there while visiting me; they said it was convenient (near bus routes, Green Lake and a wonderful mix of restaurants and bars and coffee places in Phinney). They described it as no frills, but clean, quiet and priced right. They said the bathroom and kitchen are nice, but the bedroom is on the small side.  "
103466,12546631,2014-05-05,13379565,Linda,"This was the perfect place for us to stay.  It was private, clean, well designed, and made us feel at home.  My husband and I were traveling with our 13 year old son.  We all slept great and enjoyed breakfasts together before heading out for Seattle adventures.  We definitely will be back.  Thank you Sonal!"
103466,12892480,2014-05-13,349997,Helen,"My mother, 2 1/2 year daughter and I  where in Seattle for Mother's Day.
This guest cottage was perfect for my family.  The updated amenities, comfortable bed(s), laundry and location to yummy restaurants and the zoo helped to make our first to Seattle great.  The host was accessible but not in our face.  She provided guidance on restaurants and sights in and around the area.  If you are interested in staying on the other side of Lake Union, the cottage  in Phinney is ideal located to Ballard, Fremont and Wellington.

There is one bus - #5 - that services the neighborhood and goes downtown.  If you need more flexibility, you will need a car (your own, Car2Go or Zipcar).  I would definitely stay here again."
103466,13605716,2014-06-01,5550258,Arden,"I just wrapped up another stay (my third) at the cottage and as I have grown to expect, it was perfectly cozy and comfortable, clean and well equipped. The neighborhood is beautiful with a lovely park and the zoo within two blocks. While business brings me to Seattle on my own, I can see why small families would find the cottage and location perfect.  Sonal is a gracious and accommodating host, available when you need but always respectful of your privacy.  I look forward to my next visit which is already booked. "
103466,13799559,2014-06-04,12425975,Jill,"We really enjoyed staying in Sonal and Mark's cottage in Phinney Ridge. It is very conveniently located close to family that we were visiting in the Green Lake area. Cute neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. 
The cottage is very nicely furnished and super cozy. It was so nice to be able to cook breakfast in our own kitchen and lounge in the living area to watch TV in the evening. Mark and Sonal are very accommodating and really wanted to know how they could make their cottage more comfortable for us. We will definitely try to stay again when we are in town."
103466,13884059,2014-06-07,8290121,Nora,Beautiful cottage in Phinney Ridge neighborhood.  Spacious and comfortable.  Nice coffee shop nearby and parking was available within 1 or 2 blocks of the property.  Host was very gracious and responded promptly to email.  Would highly recommend.
103466,14146800,2014-06-13,13108777,Sandra,"I loved the cottage . It was clean, well-decorated, nice sheets, good bathroom with shower. An equipped kitchen.  I could have settled down there permanently and taken morning walks to the coffee shop and bakery. Mid-day walk to the zoo. Afternoon walks to the farmer’s market.  Near the 5 bus to downtown. Thank you for a lovely location and vacation home.  "
103466,14349025,2014-06-17,14657110,Donna,"The cottage was absolutely perfect for my stay during my daughter's graduation ceremonies at UW/Seattle.  Had she had time to stay with me overnight, it would have easily accommodated both my daughter and me.  I slept at the cottage three evenings, and my daughter and I played board games two of the evenings. One of my favorite furnishings was the couch that can be used as a lounge while watching t.v. (I believe I need to purchase ones.) The hosts were friendly, caring and nonintrusive.  I had left the door open one evening while we were playing games and the husband came over to check on me and be sure I was ok, and that I'd left the door open intentionally and was actually present. My sleep was excellent. It's a quiet neighborhood, and the shutters worked perfectly to keep the living space dark when I wished to sleep.  If I find myself in Seattle again, I'd love to stay here again. "
103466,14617620,2014-06-23,15095937,Melissa,Great little cottage in an awesome part of Seattle!  We would definately stay here again next time we are in town!  
103466,15027452,2014-07-01,12404931,Kelly,"Great neighborhood, fantastic price and problem free! This was our first visit to Seattle and loved our stay. Our family of 3 fit comfortably in this cottage and had every need met by our host. We will definitely recommend this to all of our friends!"
103466,15174758,2014-07-04,2575973,Michael,"I want to move to Phinney Ridge after staying at the Private Cottage! In essence, my family and I absolutely loved staying at the private cottage. Sonal was a wonderful host. The cottage is located in the heart of Phinney Ridge and is a little house in the back of the main house with use of the back courtyard. The craftsman style cottage was elegantly designed not only for aesthetics but for economical use of space. Sonal provided everything a guest coming in with nothing but a suitcase full of dirty laundry would need to include washer/dryer, laundry detergent, dishes, dish soap, soap, shampoo, wifi, expanded cable (really useful for the kids who need there Nick Jr or Boomerang fix), all that. Sonal also made the lock a key code that she provides before you arrive, so you don't have to arrange key pick up or drop off, which is very convenient. And the neighborhood itself is gorgeous, and 2 short blocks to the park and zoo! I want to stay here again when my family returns to Seattle! Thanks, Sonal."
103466,15747310,2014-07-15,12938344,Kirk,"This cottage was amazing inside and had all the convenience of home built into a very tight space. Sonal and Mark were excellent hosts and provided everything we could have needed during the trip, as well as help on the day we checked in. The location near the Zoo on scenic Phinney Ridge was wonderful, and would definitely stay in this property again if in the area."
103466,16009831,2014-07-20,6703902,Christy,"The cottage was perfect. It was clean, nicely decorated and in a great neighborhood.  We stayed with our two children. It is located within short walking distance to the zoo, restaurants, and parks. The washer/dryer was a great bonus. Sonal was quick to respond to texts and the check-in process was easy with the lock box. "
103466,16703775,2014-08-01,5550258,Arden,"I am a regular visitor to the Seattle area and the Phinney Ridge Cottage has become my home away from home.  Sonal and Mark are great hosts who are always available when you need anything, but otherwise practically invisible (in a nice way).  

The super-private cottage is always comfortable, clean, quiet, and well-equipped.  With warmer weather during this stay, they even had a silent Dyson fan in the bedroom which I appreciated, being accustomed to San Francisco cool summer weather.  The location is convenient with restaurants, parks and even the Zoo are within a couple of blocks of your door.

I'm sure I will be back again!"
103466,17199651,2014-08-09,11902626,Marie,"My husband and 16 month old daughter enjoyed our stay at Sonal and Mark's cottage. The place was comfortable, private, clean and felt like home. If you have kids, you cannot beat the location! Walking distance to a large playground that leads to the zoo! Restaurants are within walking distance and Greenlake/downtown/Space Needle is just a short drive away. Will definitely want to stay here again (if I can't convince the hubby to move out here!).  

Note: if you are bringing a portable crib, keep in mind that the bedroom is not large enough, so you will need to set it up on living room. Worked out fine for us!"
103466,17510275,2014-08-13,8752705,Christie,"Highly recommended!! We loved the Cottage, it was absolutely perfect. Clean, spacious, and inviting. It felt like a home away from home! The washer/dryer was the icing on the cake. The full kitchen was so nice to have. The bathroom was huge, bright, and clean. Sonal was so friendly and accommodating - terrific host!
The neighbourhood was amazing, we were able to walk to restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, etc, and we loved being close to Green Lake - perfect for a morning run or walk. We had such a great time and can't wait to come back and stay in the Cottage again!"
103466,17826176,2014-08-18,181381,Sidney,"the cottage is very spacious and comfortable.  We needed to be in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood.  So the location was perfect.
Mark and Sonal were very helpful.
"
103466,18799204,2014-09-01,2969011,Oswaldo,"Really great cottage! The location is super convenient and only about 15 minutes from downtown. Although, there is tons to do just blocks away. The cottage is very private with a private entrance and looks exactly like it does in the photos. There is also a super high tech washer and dryer that came in very handy. And if you feel like staying in, there's a TV with Directv and a Wii as well as a few books (started reading Game of Thrones and now I have to buy it because I didn't have time to finish it). We will likely book it again when we return to Seattle. Thank you for everything, Sonal!"
103466,19270839,2014-09-09,17894568,Niconie,I visited the 1st weekend of September and I greatly enjoyed my stay. It was a nice cute little place. Perfect for me and my friend. It was a great location for us and there were plenty of places to walk to. It was a nice neighborhood. It was my first time visiting Seattle and I fell in love. My stay with Sonal was nothing but wonderful. She was very responsive! I didn't have the pleasure to meet her but she is a great host. Thank you so much for letting me stay with you! If I'm ever in Seattle again I know who to contact for a place to stay! 
103466,19412648,2014-09-12,9123823,Elizabeth,"We loved our stay here. Sonal had the cottage ready for us when we arrived with cute thank you mints and champagne in the refrigerator! It was very clean, comfortable and quiet, located in a really cute neighborhood. We were happy to be outside of the downtown area, but close enough to hop on the bus or grab a cab. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this spot. "
103466,19544907,2014-09-14,19988193,Jessica,"This private cottage was very comfortable and clean. It was great that Sonal provided a washer and dryer! The cottage was stocked with everything one could possibly need while on vocation. Sonal was a great host that was always either a call or text away. The detached cottage provides guest with so much privacy, which is always a good thing! The cottage location is also amazing because shops, pubs, bakeries, Starbucks, restaurants were all within a walking or a 2 minute driving  distance. Overall two thumbs up. "
103466,19874888,2014-09-20,18674250,Peter,Very clean and cozy cottage. Very helpful information provided by host. Location is great for walking to restaurants and stores.
103466,20020516,2014-09-22,18693142,Laura,"We had a wonderful time staying at the cottage!  This was for our trip to the zoo and our daughter did not want to leave our ""zoo house"" at the end of the weekend.  We were able to park our vehicle and walk everywhere during our stay.  The zoo was only a couple of blocks away, along with many walking trails and a playground.  We enjoyed morning coffee at Fresh Flours, lunch/dinner at Phinney Market, and pie and more coffee at A la mode Pies.  Next visit we will take the bus down to the Children's Museum, Pike Place Market, and visit Green Lake and the Phinney Farmers Market."
103466,20492336,2014-09-30,9258601,Jenifer,"The cottage in Phinney Ridge was perfect! We loved the location (so close to restaurants and the zoo) and the place just had everything we needed. There were just a couple of things in short supply during our visit but as soon as I texted Sonal, she responded and was over within minutes with the requested items. We had trouble playing a DVD but when we asked for help Mark was over finding us a solution. The cottage was clean and cozy and we loved it. Would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. "
103466,20700006,2014-10-04,20706916,Mo,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Sonal's Phinney Ridge cottage.  The space was clean, comfortable, cozy and it perfectly suited our needs. The location was easily accessible to downtown,  local restaurants and stores. It was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood.  I would highly recommend this space to anyone visiting Seattle."
103466,21295303,2014-10-14,2640990,Patti,"Sonal was wonderful with communication and sent all the information we needed about the property and the neighborhood.  She even let us check in early, which was a very nice convenience!  The cottage was clean, well stocked, and just as described on the website.  My only complaint is that the bed was rather uncomfortable.  Too saggy for us, but no previous guest seemed to have an issue with it.

We didn't actually get a chance to meet Sonal, but she was very accessible prior to our arrival and I'm sure we would have had no problem contacting her if we needed to.  It was a short trip and we were out of the house most of the time, but it was a cozy place to back to at the end of a busy day.

It was in a great neighborhood and we really enjoyed our stay!"
103466,21663558,2014-10-21,1506006,Nathan,"The Cottage was just as described, wonderfully equipped, decorated, and was very inviting.  Sonal was a great host and everything worked great.  Thanks for making our weekend in Seattle a great pleasure."
103466,22304258,2014-11-03,9059579,Cailyn,"The house was charming and perfectly located for running, grabbing coffees and visiting some our favorite seattle places. Even though we never met Sonal, communicating was easy and we didn't have any problems. I will definitely try to book here again when we're back in Seattle!"
103466,23318306,2014-11-29,12937084,Mary,"We spent Thanksgiving in Seattle, and stayed at Sonal's cottage.  Although she and her family were away for part of the week, she made sure everything was ready for us and that we had everything we needed to come and go.  Cottage was clean and as pictured.  It's really a very convenient place for the Phinney Ridge and Green Lake area... our favorite part of Seattle.  We travel to Seattle frequently to visit family and hope to stay again."
103466,24522920,2014-12-30,21383738,Terry,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, which we appreciated very much.  My family and I went to visit our older daughter and her husband over the holidays as they recently moved to Seattle.  It turns out that this Airbnb was only 1 1/2 blocks away from their apt!  Overall, our stay in the cottage was very comfortable.  We slept well, and it was very quiet.  The place seemed clean.  We appreciated the plush bath towels as well as having a dryer available which we used to dry the towels after our showers.  The main room was spacious with a nice size TV.  The cottage is ideal for 2 people, giving you a generous living space and smaller sleeping area.  We were a family of 3, and it worked out well enough.  Four adults in this space could feel a bit tight, esp with only one bathroom.  Thank you to Sonal and Mark for providing us such a comfortable and homey place to stay and for their assistance!  You have a great location, so close to stores and restaurants yet situated on a residential side street."
103466,25152301,2015-01-07,19995735,Ross,"Check-in process was smooth, and we had no trouble finding the cottage.  It's a cozy spot, especially for a couple, and the location is quite convenient.  Sonal was friendly and responsive to our requests, and the cottage was as she described it.  I would stay here again!"
103466,25945779,2015-01-30,414366,Kelly,Sonal's place was clean and comfortable with all the amenities of home! Hope to stay there again on my next trip.
103466,28585735,2015-03-26,28372933,Daaniel,This was a great place to stay! Very close to all the great outskirt neighborhoods of Seattle. 
103466,29485806,2015-04-08,8673268,Tony And Linda,"The location was accurately described and was the most compelling reason we chose this property. Property was as described in promotional material, but was inadequately maintained. Most notably, it was cold inside and the only heater was not sufficient to heat the place and rattled uncontrollably when used. We had to bring in an additional space heater lent to us by our daughter. In addition, there were non-working light bulbs and no extra blankets."
103466,30567919,2015-04-24,7751434,Britta,"Cosy cottage in a very pleasant neighborhood next to Green Lake. Sonal and Marc have been very nice hosts and helped immediately in all cases. The cottage is as shown in the pictures. We used the sleeping sofa for our babies which was very convenient. Well equipped kitchen, even a blender for smoothies. We enjoyed our stay and definitly recommend this place - would return anytime! Anyhow, you need to know: when it's cold outside, it gets lousy cold in the cottage although there are several heaters. It takes a while to heat the cottage in the morning.
"
103466,33286492,2015-05-26,16688119,Scott,"Sonal, your cottage was perfect for our needs in Seattle. Nicely appointed, clean and efficient. Very well located as well. We'll consider returning for future visits! "
103466,34620935,2015-06-10,15547122,Deirdre,"Very nice experience. My parents stayed for 10 days and found the cottage quite comfortable.
"
103466,35780947,2015-06-22,28872787,Mary,The Phinney Ridge Cottage was perfect fit for us. It offered all modern conveniences and was literally a block away from many good places to eat. Sonal was easy to communicate with and very helpful!  
103466,36540451,2015-06-29,30479317,Jason Paul,"We loved the cottage! It's located in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood, a few short blocks from the Zoo and Woodland Park, both excellent places to bring kids. Downtown Seattle was a breeze to get too (the express bus is a few blocks away - but the drive was easy only about 15 minutes) as well as Fremont area being nearby for biking around.  

We never met our hostess face-to-face, but the entryway into the cottage was private and although the cottage is small for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids) we were happy and comfortable. We did request more paper towels and toilet paper and her partner brought them over right away which was nice.  

Grocery stores nearby (Trader Joe's and Safeway), farmer's market a few blocks away, places to eat and shop just half-block away, and parking was usually available nearby or in front of the house without restrictions. Be mindful that the streets are narrow since it's an old neighborhood the streets weren't designed for cars originally.

When we visit Seattle again, hopefully we'll be able to stay here again.  Thank you Sonal (and family) for helping make our family vacation so much fun."
103466,38271811,2015-07-14,14249549,Elizabeth,"This place was great! I love the location, I lived in Seattle a few years ago but I wasn't familiar with Phinney Ridge. It's an adorable neighborhood and easy access to to all areas of Seattle. Every morning it was an easy walk to breakfast (Fresh Flours for delicious coffee & pastries!). The actual place we stayed was tucked behind the main house. It is very cute but I think the pictures make it look slightly larger and lighter than it was in person. I'm not sure of it would have worked if we had stayed too much longer, it was a little tight for 4 of us. The hosts were wonderful and very responsive when we were looking for extra sheets and towels. Overall it was a great location for our needs and I would recommend it to anyone!"
103466,41324134,2015-08-07,29627785,Stacey,"Sonal's cottage was awesome.  The cottage was clean, quiet and in a great location.  The kitchen is well stocked, beds are comfortable and the cottage is spacious enough for 2 adults, 2 kids ( we also had a few family members over for a visit and there was plenty of seating).  The kids really enjoyed the great playground 2 blocks away and there are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance.  We had an excellent experience at Sonal's cottage and we would definitely stay here again."
103466,41944414,2015-08-10,13875035,Steven,"Sonal was a great host in that she was very understanding with allowing my college age sons and their friends to stay in the cottage.   I didn't actually stay in the cottage, but my sons said that they really liked the cottage because it was comfortable and it had everything they needed during the stay.   They liked the neighborhood and the convenience of having great restaurants within walking distance from the cottage.
Sonal was very responsive with responding to questions and providing all the information needed for the stay in the cottage.  "
103466,42414596,2015-08-13,20669636,Kelly,Great place and perfect for what we needed.  Very clean and that's one of my musts while traveling.  Sonal was quick to respond to any questions or requests we had during our stay.  I would definitely suggest her Private Cottage to a friend.
103466,43031492,2015-08-17,24882757,Rachel,"We (two couples) stayed at Sonal's cute garden cottage for 4 nights. The kitchen was wonderful; modern and fully stocked with tools. Bathroom was very clean and bright. The pull out couch was fine, but we knew that in advance. Although windows don't open, there is an awesome screen door and plenty of fans. Phinney area is very nice with little shops and groceries near by. Parking or rental car was very easy. "
103466,43521012,2015-08-20,37999374,Maureen,Sonal and her husband Mark welcomed my husband and I warmly; despite our very late arrival time (1:30 am!)...and the little cottage was very much as pictured.  We loved the Phinney Ridge neighborhood and all of the places within walking distance! We especially enjoyed walking to the Woodland Park Zoo...VERY close and fun.  
103466,44133854,2015-08-24,12194292,DeLissa,"The Phinney Ridge neighborhood is darling! We loved walking around to the restaurants, down to the lake and even the farmer's market on Friday night. Location was perfect. Walking one block to the bus station was so easy and brought us into downtown within 20 minutes. Sonal was quick to respond to emails and was flexible with providing local information! As three women we felt safe the entire time, walking to and from the cottage and sleeping in the cottage. 

Our favorite places to eat within walking distance: 

Mai Thaiku
Ken's Market for groceries
Herkimer Coffee
Bluebird Ice cream, don't forget to say hello to the firemen along the way!

Highly recommend staying here. "
103466,46915205,2015-09-14,33603949,Michael,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
103466,47176690,2015-09-16,2644587,Sarah,"The cottage is great. The location is perfect, walking distance to restaurants and shopping, and Woodland Park and zoo, and public transportation. Parking is easy too. The cottage itself is very comfortable with a great layout. Its located behind a main house and feels very private. Sonal and her husband are great hosts. They provided plenty of written information about the cottage and check-in, check-out procedures and the area. We had one little issue with the laundry but they responded quickly and everything was taken care of. I'd highly recommend this place!"
103466,49221521,2015-10-02,12299695,Alene,"
Nice space, plenty of room.  Nicely remodeled kitchen and bath.  Comfortable and private.  Recommend to anyone looking for a place on Phinney Ridge that is convenient."
103466,51576119,2015-10-21,45777766,Cindy,"Sonal's pre-arrival instructions were very helpful and complete; hassle-free check-in/out. Location is great for Green Lake, Fresh Flours (perfect coffee and bakery shop!), and lots of cute restaurants (Mai Thaiku and Modern were excellent), boutiques, and grocery nearby. Easy access to downtown. Cottage is wonderful, clean, and spacious -- would be happy to return!"
103466,54384832,2015-11-19,30441251,Matt,"The cottage at Phinney Ridge was a great stay. Sonal provided an all inclusive manual via email regarding the cottage and surrounding neighborhood. Creature comforts are well supported with wifi, direct tv, a super kitchen, front loading washer/dryer, and Egyptian cotton sheets. While I did not meet Sonal and Mark in person, they checked in to make sure I was taken care of. Good communication via text. "
103466,55218826,2015-11-29,32492233,Vaniece,"The cottage was exactly as described. It was clean, well furnished and comfortable. I look forward to staying there again."
4429898,23311210,2014-11-28,22900076,Rachel,"We feel very fortunate to have found this sweet place.  We needed somewhere to stay very last minute and Lara was incredibly understanding and welcoming.  The space is comfortable and very clean, and we really appreciated being able to have our dogs stay as well.  
The hosts provided us with everything we needed and were very responsive to any questions we had. "
4429898,23827888,2014-12-11,13997957,Aindrea,"Awesome location about a mile from downtown Ballard with tons of cute places to visit.  I did brewery and distillery tours and lots of gift shopping for the holidays.  Lara also lent me a great bike that got me super easily over to the Fremont area as well, where there is more of the same- great restaurants etc.  The bike trail (Burke-Gilman) is just at the bottom of the hill from the house which is in a very nice quiet neighborhood.  I did not ride super far on the trail, but apparently it is quite long and will take you to tons of great Seattle spots!  

The room itself is more than a room- has its own bathroom, kitchenette and everything I would need if I wanted a totally private stay.  Pretty much the entire downstairs to the whole house is all yours.  Very clean and comfortable with a fun tiki theme.  It was raining when I was up there and somewhat cold, but I was plenty warm and cozy in the space and Lara left out extra blankets just in case.  As it was wet outside, I did not utilize the patio, but nice area with a little fire pit and plenty of seating that would be great for use during better weather.  Would be an awesome reading spot with all of the passion fruit vines in bloom!    

More on the host: As I mentioned before, I could have had a completely private and solitary stay if desired, but Lara was super helpful and sweet.  When getting all the bike stuff from her she was also great about giving directions and suggestions which were all perfect for what I was looking for.  We actually walked to a little happy hour spot for some evening snacks and had a great visit.  Awesome lady who has travelled a lot, as have I, with tons of great stories.  Very friendly and genuine, but also perfectly respectful of ""my"" space downstairs.  

Overall:  would highly recommend this place!  Amazing location, super digs that are clean and comfortable and private as well as my favorite airbnb hosts so far!  And of course the icing on the cake: the bicycle borrowing availability!...and the easy access to trails and local spots via bike- or walking for that matter- major bonus in my travel preferences.  Would definitely stay at Lara's again and will most likely try to book again soon when I'm up there checking out grad school at UW!  

Oh yeah- forgot to mention, she has the cutest little puppy!  A bit shy at first, but once she warms up, she is the biggest sweetheart with the funkiest hair do ever;)  Love love love!  

 "
4429898,24872843,2015-01-03,5797830,Kellie,Lara did a great job of making us welcomed with a bottle of champagne and beautiful flowers. The location was good for us as we wanted to spend most of our time in Ballard. The apartment is as pictured. It's pretty quiet.
4429898,26001289,2015-02-01,1660573,Brigid,"Lara was a great host, very welcoming and understanding of our situation. We needed a monthly rental and she was accomadating with both of us and our 80lb dog. The mini fridge was broken when we got there, and she immediately got us a new fridge. The place was stocked with toiletries, toilet paper and some cooking utensils. It was cozy and warm and it was great having laundry access. Whenever we needed anything for the apartment, we would text and she would get back to us quickly. 
The area was very convenient and we could always find parking on the block. Overall it was a great place to crash for a month. "
4429898,28926689,2015-04-01,25099909,Garin,"My fiancee and I, along with our 2 dogs stayed, with Lara for about 3 months while we closed on our new home.  Finding ourselves in a new state/city and feeling quite unconnected, Lara went well out of our way to make us feel comfortable and at-home at all times.  Lara is an amazing person, striking the perfect balance between privacy and hostess-care.  She cooked us some delicious meals, and is an ideal resource for activities and interests in the area.  The space she provides is cozy, spacious, and great for either short-term or long-term stays.  If you're looking for luxury, perhaps you'd be more comfortable in a hotel.  However, if you prefer for a more personal experience in the heart of Ballard, look no further than Lara."
4429898,31068962,2015-05-01,3040653,John,"We were warmly welcomed and made feel comfortably at home by Lara.

The accommodation was accurately described in the listing. It is well set up for long-term stays with necessary equipment for laundry and simple dining in. A very good deli is around the corner as is a great little neighborhood restaurant/bistro, ""The Barking Dog."" Other dining and pub possibilities are in easy walking distance.

Lara's fenced backyard and patio provide a place for a dog to stretch and the neighborhood is well suited for dog walking. Lara is a caring host for people and pets.

A frequent service busline to downtown Seattle is very convenient. The central location is a plus. It is midway between the University of Washington campus-I-5 corridor and the Ballard waterfront and beach parks along the Sound.

This modest accommodation is well suited for a long and comfortable stay."
4429898,31584029,2015-05-07,20563718,Josh,"Our stay at Cleopatra Casa was awesome.  Lara was super helpful and accommodating.  Clean, comfortable, and quiet basement apartment.  Separate bedroom and living room was a plus.  Cable TV, clean towels and coffee to make you feel at home.  Quiet neighborhood within walking distance of cool bars and restaurants.  We'll definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle!!"
4429898,35295037,2015-06-17,19073857,Anita,"Nice neighborhood. The back yard is next to 8th Ave., a busy street, but it wasn't very noisy. Lara left flowers, coffee, and granola for our use. She was very flexible with our arrival time."
4429898,35806359,2015-06-22,21873465,Leslie,"My dad was visiting from California. We live in Ballard and Lara's place was a short drive from our house. I booked this space for him. Lara was friendly right from the start. I never met her, but my dad said she was incredibly friendly and helpful. The space was clean and comfortable. We sat out in the private yard area every day he was there. It was just as described. It is very close to restaurants. My dad walked to The Fat Hen 2 days in a row for their delicious breakfast. Great experience! "
4429898,36682941,2015-06-30,19126857,Amanda,"We had a fantastic stay here over a long weekend, while we worked at an event at the Seattle Center. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been better! The space was clean and inviting, easy to access, and Lara was very friendly and easy to reach in all her communications.

We were worried it might get hot during a heatwave, but the basement space was very cool and had a big oscillating fan for us to use. The private, outdoor patio was awesome for relaxing in the evenings. 

Street parking was easy to find, even with a large trailer on our car. The bus lines nearby made it really easy to get to downtown during the day, and there was a lot within a few blocks in the neighborhood. We definitely want to come back! Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood with lots to see, while staying very laidback."
4429898,38698607,2015-07-18,4742829,Dorothy,"Lara communicated very well and was flexible with our arrival time which we appreciated since we were driving from OH. The many thoughtful touches--flashlight, comfortable bedding, kitchen supplies including homemade granola--made us feel right at home. We were also grateful for the use of a washer and dryer during out stay.The apt. was cool and comfortable with a cool breeze crossing between windows in an uncharacteristically hot, dry summer. Our daughter who lives nearby chose to stay with us for this reason.  We enjoyed the location and Ballard restaurants and cafes were delightful when we were not eating on the patio with family. We also enjoyed the Ballard Locks and our pet dog enjoyed his meal at the Barking Dog Ale House and the many dog water dishes on the sidewalks in the area. Nearby Kirche Park was a favorite for all of us."
4429898,39260617,2015-07-22,25647627,Anne,Very cute and clean apartment! Lara was a great host! Thanks a lot! 
4429898,40199266,2015-07-29,8859197,Linda,Lara was very welcoming & the apartment was exactly as described. The neighborhood felt very safe (we took several walks) & also used the bus since the stop was so close & parking in the city was expensive. We would definitely use this place again.
4429898,40587012,2015-08-01,30319900,Hyunjee,"Yeah i have lots of stories to write about. Although i didn't have a chance to see host but, every time asked her for a favor she helped me out so well 
And i have to say sorry i disturbed host middle of nights... Anyway the basement was really amazing cozy to stay everying is well prepared!!! Highly recommen you guys to stay"
4429898,41243509,2015-08-05,20021268,John,"We spent 3 nights at Lara's place during our recent trip to Seattle.  The accommodation was clean, quiet and cozy.  We appreciated there being a nice pack of good local coffee. Lara was very helpful and flexible with our late arrival time.  Her assistance with the bicycles was absolutely fantastic.  There is a deli and food shop next to a nearby bus stop.  That bus route runs right through the downtown Seattle area which made our sightseeing very convenient.  Ballard is a friendly neighborhood and the Fremont area is a short bike ride away."
4429898,41806559,2015-08-09,38101496,Carlene,"Definitely a basement! We walked down a steep, creaky staircase right next to owners' kitchen, covered by a curtain. There were several open spaces filled with stuff that were covered by cloths. There was an odd smell that permeated the place our entire stay. Not to mention the 2 huge spiders we had to squash (yes, I'm aware it's a basement). 
The amenities were nice! Especially the washer/dryer. Lara was great at communicating and checked in on us via text! We appreciated the mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee/coffee maker (although we had to clean it before use). The bedroom was a nice reprieve with the window open and a nice comfortable bed!! The location was cool. We walked to the Fat Hen and had a delicious breakfast.

I just didn't have the same feelings as the rest of the reviewers and thought I should be as honest as possible. This place wasn't for me. The price is right, but next time, I'll fork up more money and stay elsewhere...I actually considered that the minute I walked in."
4429898,42381914,2015-08-13,12027569,Noraleigh,"My almost 12 yr old daughter & I spent 3 nights with Lara and it was such a nice relaxing experience. Lara  was very welcoming & great with all communications. The apartment was actually so much better than listing, everything was spot on. The bed is super comfy as well as the couch-which was greatly appreciated after sight seeing around town all day we were sore & tired! The space is quiet and we barely heard anyone upstairs. Awesome shower head/water pressure as well as plenty of hot water!  The space is equipped with everything one would need, including a lovely side yard with BBQ & a patio. The neighborhood is perfect as it's between Ballard & Phinney Ridge so finding a coffee shop or a bite to eat is easy-even for those not familiar with Seattle. We parked the car on the street & left it there for most of our visit, opting to use the bus which is right by Lara's place. It took us to Fremont /Downtown/Pike Place, as well as the Space Needle. The neighborhood is a relaxing & residential, away from hustle & bustle from downtown, yet close enough to get to if that's what you like as well. Lara has lived in Seattle for years , she loves the city & knows it like the back of her-she  can help with ideas & advice if need be. We'll be staying with her again the next time we get up to Seattle & I'll be recommending her space to all my friends. "
4429898,43623341,2015-08-21,776053,Alexandria,Very welcoming. Lara made check in so simply especially because we arrived in Seattle very late. She had the best restaurant suggestions and offered help often. We were a pretty quiet couple who were gone most of the day so it was great to come home to a quiet home at night. The apt was just the right size for us and the location was amazing. It was a real bang for our buck!  We only wished that we could have seen sweet little Zoe more. 
4429898,44323338,2015-08-25,890165,Chrissy,"Lara's place was perfect for myself, a friend and her pup for a long weekend. The bed is uber comfy and we had more than enough room. We really dug how close her place is to several shops and restaurants in Ballard. Overall a great stay!"
4429898,45368108,2015-09-02,18046316,Lura,"We had a great stay in Lara's apartment! The neighborhood has restaurants within walking distance, though we had a car so didn't use any of the public transportation options. The kitchenette worked well for us. We didn't want to cook so no need for a full kitchen, but it was nice to be able to make coffee and heat up leftovers, and it was stocked with some convenience items like coffee, oatmeal, etc. Lara was helpful and responsive by text with any questions that came up. It is definitely a basement apartment so low ceilings and limited natural light, but it had everything we needed, was clean, spacious, and well-priced."
4429898,45792698,2015-09-06,16113703,Jin,"We enjoyed a great 3 night stay at Lara's place, which had everything we needed. From the start, Lara made the check-in process very easy and was good about communicating with us even before arrival. When we arrived, we noticed that there is only a curtain separating the downstairs airbnb unit from the main house. However, this was not an issue at all because we still had all the privacy we wanted. The bedroom gets good natural lighting whereas the living room does not, so we spent our nights and evenings in the living room and that turned out just fine. The neighborhood is residential so it was nice and quiet for sleeping. We took the 28 bus to go downtown and it worked out well. Thanks for a great stay! "
4429898,47632615,2015-09-21,35094927,Sandy,We enjoyed our visit. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Lara is very welcoming and we hope to stay with her in the future.
4429898,48631521,2015-09-27,44673113,Don,"Quiet, private, food and drink nearby. Exactly what I needed."
4429898,55350917,2015-12-01,14975262,Jason,Lara has gone above & beyond to make sure our stay has been great! She's always available when needed &  has even been a huge help with our pup! We couldn't be more happier with her as a host.
5744931,28760352,2015-03-29,29890141,Jovan,"Cute, clean apartment that is exactly as it looks in the photos. Lively, but fun neighborhood. Easy access to the university, shops, and bus lines. We appreciated the accommodations of coffee, oatmeal, and wine. The reserved parking spot was a huge bonus. The bed was comfortable and shower was consistently warm. Morteza was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Overall, our stay was wonderful and we would highly recommend staying here!"
5744931,29941480,2015-04-14,30218684,Jessica,"Morteza was a great host! He was flexible on our arrival and departure--even letting us check out later because of a 10 p.m. flight arrival on day one and 10 p.m. departure on the last day. Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. 

We cooked but a few essentials were missing for proper cooking and cleaning, though we worked with what we had! (Maybe a skillet spatula and dishwashing sponge? And more than 1.5 rolls of TP) 

The only glaring issue was a house party (in the same house/unit) on Friday night that was so loud the walls were vibrating with bass/music and we could hear people falling down and yelling from 6:45 p.m. to 2 a.m. We weren't sure which other unit it was but Morteza apologized, spoke to the college students renting, and it didn't happen again. We only cared because we chose Friday to do a day hike and wanted to have a calm, quiet night in cooking dinner!

The neighborhood is definitely young (University District) and fun with plenty of interesting bits of culture and restaurants. Make sure you are ok with being around a bunch of college students if you stay here! We had a nice spot for our rental car in back of the apartment and it was really convenient. 

Thanks again, Morteza, and best wishes. I recommend this spot as a temporary getaway or home for anyone visiting Seattle.
"
5744931,35362144,2015-06-17,13584908,Peggy,The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5744931,38697463,2015-07-18,24933442,Matt,"Morteza was an excellent host. Checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we had everything that we needed. If we ever had any issues like the Internet being reset, it was fixed within the hour. The apartment was just as described and the pictures were accurate. The neighborhood was nice but it could get noisy some nights being that it is close to the college. Everything was in walking distance which made it very convenient. Overall we had a great stay! "
5744931,39545462,2015-07-24,5374392,Juzer,"Great host, location and communications.  The tea, coffee & wine was a great welcoming.   Thank you Morteza!"
5744931,45704940,2015-09-05,1606832,Juli,Morteza was a most excellent host. Super easy to contact and really friendly. When the wifi went out he was there within 30 minutes to set up a new modem and brought me hangers the next day since he noticed they were missing! The apartment is tiny but sweet and very clean! Great area close to everything you could possibly need. Would come back again for sure!
5744931,46287593,2015-09-09,39430258,Hesham,"Morteza is a very gracious and responsive host. He always promptly replied to emails and text messages from the minute I booked until I checked out. The apartment is as-advertised--clean and cozy, but more than enough to accommodate three adults. The neighborhood is very young as can be expected in University District, with college students dominating the area. It is also very central to many of the Seattle hot spots. One quick tip--if you're using Google Maps to locate the apartment, note that the reserved parking is in the alley between 19th and 18th (Google Maps will take you to the front of the apartment on 19th)."
7800238,51382025,2015-10-19,46085428,Oy,Amazing experience in a beautiful cottage near dt Seattle. We came out for a romantic weekend and the cottage was more than perfect. Andy and Betty provide a very unique experience. They have a beautiful home and provided the privacy we were looking for as a couple. If I ever go back to Seattle I will certainly try to stay with Andy and Betty again
7800238,52026576,2015-10-25,46970688,Maria,The place was very quaint and cozy. We loved that it was close to the downtown area and in a residential location that allowed us to take our morning walk. The cottage was perfect and so adorable. I'll be looking to stay again on my next trip out to Seattle. Thank you Betty and Anthony for a perfect weekend!
7800238,52235533,2015-10-27,34988856,Carmen,Andy & Betty are amazing. They are some of the kindest and warm people you'll meet. Their hospitality and thoughtfulness were such a sweet way to begin our stay at the cottage. We can't wait to return! They're amazing hosts and the cottage itself is full of warmth & charm- so perfect for a restful vacation. 
7800238,53034280,2015-11-03,24011318,Elie,"This was a fantastic place! Very cozy, cute propane stove. We were happy to stay there for a couple nights. There was a problem with the toilet that the host fixed right away (he actually had to dig up the pipes !). The only thing is that internet was difficult to connect to and not very fast. But it was workable. All in all, still an awesome place to stay at!"
7800238,53199586,2015-11-06,22196820,Yumiko,"We had a wonderful time staying here!  It's a beautiful cottage! Andy and Betty were really nice hosts and made us feel welcome.  There are 2 bus stops that are within walking distance, so it was very convenient to use public transportation.  I would definitely recommend staying here!"
7800238,53409685,2015-11-08,34467354,Peri,We had a wonderful time seeing Seattle from Andy and Betty's cottage! They accommodated all our requests and the location worked well for us. They have a very friendly and sweet cat and a fig tree that made for a beautiful view!
7800238,53710725,2015-11-11,45990621,Lauren,"Our stay at the cottage was just lovely. Super cozy, clean, and full of little touches that made it feel like a home away from home. And it smells good. ;) We ended up spending more time just relaxing there than we planned on because it was just so comfortable. Convenient location, close to everything, yet far enough to still feel like a little retreat. Betty and Andy are wonderful hosts, and we would absolutely stay here again."
7800238,53893194,2015-11-14,4140425,Susannah,"I can not express how much we loved this beautiful cottage! Great location, perfect little cottage, all the amenities you'll need for the perfect Seattle vacation. We loved staying here. Betty&Andy are the perfect hosts. Betty was kind enough to pack up the few items we accidentally left in the cottage and had it waiting for us to pick up afterwards. 
Also FYI those raisin muffins are amazing."
7800238,54389122,2015-11-19,8039300,Fernando,"This was by far the best experience we have had with air bnb. The cottage we stayed at was cozy, inviting, and perfect for our time in Seattle. Andy and Betty are the nicest hosts who went out of their way to make sure we had a pleasant, and comfortable experience. They made themselves completely available to us in case we had any questions. Their cottage provided everything we needed and more for our visit. We will definitely be staying in their cottage the next time we visit Seattle. Thanks again for being so welcoming, kind, and friendly to my sister and I."
7800238,55086648,2015-11-27,44806580,Noah,"Our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't be happier! Andy and Betty are great people who will go out of their way to help their guests. Unfortunately our vehicle was vandalized the first day of our stay but Andy and Betty came to the rescue by helping us tape up our windows and letting us stay past our check-out time so the necessary repairs could be made. Thanks guys! The cottage was beautifully furnished, has a neat balcony, cozy atmosphere, and plenty warm in the frigid temperatures. Very satisfied with our stay, would recommend to anyone looking for a high quality, well located place to stay in Seattle. "
7800238,55267405,2015-11-29,262611,Jane,What a fantastic place! Fig Cottage is adorable and cozy. Betty and Andy are so nice and helpful. This place is on our top list for any visit to Seattle! Thank you!
7800238,55665221,2015-12-04,47415093,Anna,I felt welcomed before I even checked in.  The ad was accurate.  We were close to everything.  We used public transportation with the help of the info provided in the cottage.   Andy and Betty are fantastic people !!  
7800238,55994957,2015-12-07,42605905,Katy,"Andy and Betty have created a wonderful, welcoming environment by providing off street parking, creating a clear pathway through the backyard to the cottage and providing little details like homemade muffins, Christmas lights and slippers. The kitchen was very well stocked and the cottage was super cute and relaxing. The bed was super comfy, and the upstairs deck has a really nice view. I loved it!
Those who are super sound sensitive should know that Beacon Hill as a neighborhood gets a lot of air traffic due to the Boeing and SeaTac airports. I noticed this from the cottage loft but it would not stop me from staying here again or highly recommending Fig Cottage to friends."
7800238,56253997,2015-12-11,14673370,Mara,"Andy and Betty's cottage was even cuter than expected! Super comfortable and convenient. Their cat Buchi was super lovable and friendly. Our first night Andy and Betty took time out of their schedule to give us some recommendations of their favorite places in the area, as we were looking for a local view on Seattle. Super wonderful deck that would be perfect to enjoy coffee on in the warmer months. Loved the Christmas tree touch during this holiday season. This will be my first pick next time we're in town. Thank you again!"
7800238,56423200,2015-12-13,50145140,Shane,"I really enjoyed my stay at Andy and Betty's cottage. They had taken care to provide a wealth of amenities (tea and bluetooth speakers especially appreciated) and the cottage was very clean. It's also very private and nicely situated on the side of hill. The location is excellent for a quiet place to relax that is convenient to the rest of Seattle. Locally, I can't help but recommend a visit to the very close Bar del Corso - their food is approaching world class. Andy and Betty were easy to communicate with and I imagine terrific in person. Though we didn't meet, I appreciated the privacy and their relaxed and competent manner of hosting. "
7800238,56728259,2015-12-17,21108100,Jessica,"I rented this sweet cottage for my husband's parents while they were in town to visit their new grandson! It was perfect, they loved it. They were already talking about how nice it will be to sit on the deck when they visit again in the summer. They also enjoyed the resident cat who came for visits! "
7800238,56959032,2015-12-20,25232396,Elena,"Betty & Andy's cottage is lovely! It was easy to find, safe, and clean. We enjoyed the decor, loft sleeping space, and Betty's bran muffins. We will definitely stay again. "
7800238,57763875,2015-12-29,1675991,Marie,"Andy and Betty are lovely hosts.
Everything was as listed and more. Small thoughtful touches were constantly surprising us.
And, it's so convenient to so many things in Seattle. All less than 15 minutes by car.
Thank you Andy and Betty!
We'll be back!
Marie and Ged"
6577729,34811334,2015-06-12,34550468,Paula,The house was very nice and clean with a great kitchen.  We were welcomed and the owner did what he could  to meet any requests we made.  The location is close to a good variety of shops playgrounds and grocery stores. 
6577729,35003212,2015-06-14,20984198,Carrie,Morteza came and introduced himself shortly after our arrival. He was working on the yard so he could check in on us after we arrived. The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. The place was great for our needs. There is plenty of seating and the beds were comfortable. Morteza was quick to respond to any messages or questions. It was easy to get to UW from there so it was worked perfectly as a base while there for my son's graduation. Highly recommend. 
6577729,37575710,2015-07-08,34516344,Yong,我们在这个房子中住了19天。房东非常友善，家居用品准备得非常齐备，偶尔缺少的小电器，房东也是有求必应，马上配齐。房子所在社区是非常安静的居民区，邻居都非常友善。离房子不远诸如餐厅、超市等设施都非常健全，特别是离Green Lake非常近，步行10分钟，环境优美，休闲健身非常方便。总的来说，不错的房子、不错的房东，值得推荐！
6577729,38001082,2015-07-12,20519465,Alan,"Morteza was a great host!  Very accommodating and it was great how fast he responded to messages and questions - even when he was on holiday himself! 

The place was clean and very tidy and the photos are well representative.  A great grocery store and deli just up the street as well.  Kitchen renovation is recent and nice."
6577729,38402090,2015-07-15,34364481,Leslie,"The host was very accommodating, even when we added two people to our party last minute. He made himself available for any questions and was prompt to respond. 
As for the apartment, the location was perfect. A 15 minute walk to Green Lake, which is surrounded by numerous coffee shops, eateries, and relaxing pubs to grab a drink. It was very family friendly and perfect for a warm summer's day. We were also only two blocks from a small grocery store to stock the kitchen, as well as some great breakfast spots to fill up before a full day in the city. 
The apartment was clean and comfortable. It housed 8 of us without any trouble, though we did bring a camping mattress for two guests. What we really enjoyed was the back porch, which allowed for us early risers to have a place to drink our coffee/tea while the others slept in without disturbing them. 
My only complaint would be the small children who lived upstairs. They can be loud on the weekend mornings, running across hardwood floors, if you are trying to sleep in.  "
6577729,39056064,2015-07-20,36129787,Zeynep,"Very decent nice location and nicely furnished, had good communication with Morteza. He even dropped some coffee and bits round for us."
6577729,39563104,2015-07-24,10077306,Firouzeh,"Morteza was the most gracious host; he replied to all inquires in a very timely fashion, and checked to make sure all was OK during our stay.  The apartment was clean, and neighborhood safe and quiet. My son and I stayed there for 5 days/4 nights.  Good value, especially during the peak summer vacation period in Seattle."
6577729,40218836,2015-07-29,34606377,Levi,This apartment was nice to stay great neighbors and very centrally located. Morteza made our stay in Seattle a wonderful event. 
6577729,41100884,2015-08-04,14996470,Jason,"Had a great 3 night stay at Morteza's bungalow.  The unit was as describe and depicted in pictures. Very convenient location, while on a quiet street.  Was perfect for our family (me, wife and 2 young children) bouncing around Seattle for the weekend.  As for Morteza, he was a wonderful host.  Very responsive to emails, and often proactive reaching out to me with helpful information.  The place was in great shape when we arrived with a number of very thoughtful additional welcoming touches.  Again, we had a great stay and I am sure you will too if you book this place.  Cheers!"
6577729,41402360,2015-08-07,37363545,Pat,"Comfortable and clean in a friendly, walkable, charming neighborhood. Host was available if we needed information, but not intrusive. Easy access to bus. We felt truly welcomed and amenities were just what we needed. We would definitely recommend this apartment. So great to visit a city and feel like a local. "
6577729,43111542,2015-08-17,20567743,Hadley,"We had a great stay at this rental.  The apartment was as described and was the perfect amount of space for our group of 4.  The location is great; it's less than a half-mile to Green Lake and just a couple blocks to Greenwood St., which has lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and a grocery store.  Morteza was a great host.  He responded promptly to all of my messages and was available for any questions.  "
6577729,43834879,2015-08-22,4153917,Katie,"Morteza was a wonderful host! Directions and access to the apartment were clear and easy. The location is excellent! A good market, excellent restarurants, a lovely consignment shop all withing a two bock walk. A great neighborhood to wander around as well and within walking distance of Green Lake. Also easy public transportation to downtown Seattle or the University.

The apartment is lovely and comes fully equiped including landry, blow dryer, and ironing board for those who might be traveling for work. The kitchen is well equiped and Morteza generously left a bottle of wine and bag of coffee. My daughter's only advice was to include an ice cream scoop to make it perfect and to be able to take full advantage of new gelato shop at top of hill!

Lovely little outdoor porch to eat breakfast on where to work while looking out over the trees and yards. 

Everything was clean and well stocked. 

We had a couple of snafus with keys (not due to host!) and Morteza was available and helpful in resolving the issues. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend it for families, business travellers, or anyone looking for an accessible, attractive, and comforatble stay in Seattle.
"
6577729,44436977,2015-08-26,38552868,Michele,"We enjoyed staying at Morteza's home very much. It was very clean and most comfortable. Morteza was in touch from beginning to end...a most gracious host. We met him in person just before we were leaving. Super nice. Our home for 4 and a half days was in a great neighborhood, parking was never an issue, wonderful markets close by. Very walkable area, close to Green Lake, the zoo, etc. I would definitely recommend Morteza's home to anyone looking for a nice alternative to hotel living."
6577729,54900273,2015-11-25,47985900,Jeremy,Nice house. Enjoyed our stay
6577729,55389465,2015-12-01,46122019,Martha,"This charming 2 BR flat is located in a very walkable neighborhood in the Phinney Ridge/Greenwood neighborhood.  Restaurants and shops are a block away.  

The flat was perfectly clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen is well-equipped.  We never saw Morteza (he welcomed us over the phone), mostly because we were occupied with our famly during most of the visit.  He checked in on day two to make sure we were entirely comfortable.  No complaints."
6577729,57226342,2015-12-23,9740042,Morgan,"Morteza was the perfect host; the apartment is perfectly located and thoughtfully curated, a very welcoming space. Just steps to the great restaurants and bars of Greenwood, and a few minutes to Greenlake. Highly recommend!"
6577729,57922053,2015-12-30,5524811,John,"My mom very much enjoyed staying here while visiting us. The apartment is comfortable and homey, and in a lovely neighborhood, just a block from coffee shops and grocery on Phinney Ridge. It's well appointed with a newish kitchen. Morteza is a great host - responsive and helpful. "
353347,1010343,2012-03-17,1901974,Tim,"We enjoyed our stay and found the house to be as nice as represented.  Kathy was a great host!  Upon arrival we had a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberry's.  As this was more of a business trip for me, it was nice to have internet access and a fax machine at my disposal.      It was very convenient that it was so close to downtown Seattle and the airport as I had to pick up a business colleague at the airport, and most of my meetings where close to downtown.  Very comfortable and a great value!  Would definitely stay again.  Really liked the kitchen dining area with the corner seat."
353347,1362382,2012-05-28,2070470,Annie-Claude,"My husband & I rented Kathy's house for1 week in May of 2012. Our 2 adult daughters, ages 21 & 23 joined us for the week and the house was the perfect fit for our family. 

The house is right between the airport and Seattle, which made a run to either place quick and easy, while offering us a quiet place to hunker down at night. Both of our daughters arrived at different times, so we made the drive to the airport a few times. But the location of the house made this easy. We also enjoyed going in to the city for parts of the day and still be able to return to the house easily. 

The location of the house was great too, near the Puget with great parks and walking paths by the water. We really enjoyed walkign along Waiki beach and in Lincoln park. Bakery Nouveau is out of this world! A must if you like french bakery, with great quiches, croissants, pastries, sandwishes to go. 

The house was great, good spaces. The master bed was comfortable. Kathy was very kind and generous with the use of her kitchen. She was also very helpful through emails with tips and suggestions when we asked her. She was very respectful of our spaces, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. 

We would recommend her place in a heartbeat! "
353347,1566500,2012-06-26,2301366,Todd,"Kathy was truly a superb host! She went out of her way to insure our comfort throughout the duration of our stay. The house was clean and cozy and made our transition upon moving to Seattle that much sweeter! There is really nothing quite like a soak in the hot tub under the West Seattle sky! We shall definitely recommend this beautiful, luxurious home to all our friends and family in the future to come! "
353347,1648071,2012-07-07,2301057,Liza,"Kathy is a sweetheart. She opened her house to us during the 4th of July holiday and it was a GREAT time. Not only is the house centrally located to all that Seattle has to offer but it is close to grocery stores, specialty shops, bakeries and even a Ferry Line! I want to personally thank her again for the hospitality afforded to us. We would gladly spend another vacation in her home if she would have us!"
353347,1837811,2012-07-30,2691194,Tatyana,"Kathy is one of the most kind and caring person i have ever met. She treats guests as friends and really cares for our comfort and enjoyment! House is great. Spacious, great design to cook, rest and have fun! Kathy provided any assistance and help we needed! I felt at home, really did not want to leave that place. Area is quite and very friendly! Breakfast treats that Kathy left for us totally surprised me! it was so nice of Kathy, i could not believe my eyes :) I would definitely recommend this Kathy's house to others and will stay there next time if Kathy allows! :) Don't miss out such opportunity! "
353347,1980665,2012-08-14,2381153,Frank,"We are a family of four from Germany and spent two weeks in the house. We had a wonderful time and immediately felt at home in the apartment. Everything is exactly as in the photos, and the surroundings of the house are very beautiful, next to the Puget Sound and Lincoln Park. Our kids had plenty of space to play on the deck and in the garden, and everything was very nice and comfortable. 

Kathy was a great host, very discreet but easy to reach whenever we had a question or minor problem. She was very helpful and let us do the laundry. All in all, I can only say that it was a very positive experience and I can only recommend staying here. Thank you Kathy!!"
353347,2010285,2012-08-17,2801319,Mary,"Nice quiet neighborhood, clean house, comfortable beds... it was a great ""home base"" for our family to explore Seattle for a couple of days.   Highly recommended."
353347,2263175,2012-09-11,3175835,Patrick,"I rented this house from Kathy for 4 days for my parents while they were visiting. I thought it was a better option than a stuffy hotel room that would of cost just about the same amount. The house is fantastic. It's very clean, lots of natural light, and in a very quiet neighborhood.  My parents were more than happy with everything provided. I would definitely try to rent from Kathy again."
353347,2378566,2012-09-23,173738,James,"Let me start by saying how very comfortable and clean everything was at Kathy's place! The beds especially. And the hot tub. Kathy provided all of the cooking gear we could want with plenty of the extras one needs, like cooking oil, condiments and such. We enjoyed watching the big TV in the evening and relaxing in the hot tub after long days as tourists. The single  negative thing that we encountered was the neighbor's barking dog, which was completely out of Kathy's and our control. Kathy made every attempt to have the neighbor control their pet, with some good success. Not her fault as this is in a real neighborhood with real people. If you have two couples or a family to accomodate while visiting the Seattle area you will do well here!"
353347,2698958,2012-10-24,3390637,Shimon,"We enjoyed our stay at Kathy's house very much! Kathy is welcoming and responsive - wonderful hostess. The house is spacious, cosy and clean. It is located in very quiet neighbourhood close to the Puget Sound and not far from lovely Lincoln Park. The deck, the patio and the fully equipped kitchen added to the great experience of living at Kathy's rental house."
353347,2957561,2012-11-25,942051,Meghan,"This was a charming home and we had a great experience overall. If the following things had been in place, then it would have definitely been a good deal. 
1. Hot tub was not working so we couldn't use it
2. Pilot light was out in the new gas stove. We had to light the stove each time we wanted to use it, which was a bit of a hassle for thanksgiving cooking.
3. The gas fire place did not work. The host asked for us to call for instructions, but we had already talked to her twice about the hot tub and the oven so we didn't bother.
4. Key items missing that make for a good vacation rental included oven mitt, dish towels, hand soap for the restroom and the kitchen, working ice machine, washer/dryer, etc.

Again, it was an overall great experience, a charming neighborhood close to the water. But room for improvement for sure. "
353347,3171117,2012-12-28,4095048,Jeanne,"We had a wonderful time!  The house was in a very convenient location, the neighborhood was very quiet and the house was cozy.  Our host went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect!   Thanks so much!!!!!"
353347,3983663,2013-04-01,3645751,Sandra,"We had a wonderful time in this house. The kitchen/nook/dining room layout worked well for my group of 6. We could cook and chat with no problems. The host is very supportive, friendly and responsive on email."
353347,4305286,2013-04-26,3443071,Deb,"We stayed in Kathy's house for 5 nights and it suited our purposes very well.  It was close to the friends we were visiting, easy to get to, and is in a lovely quiet neighborhood.  The house gave us plenty of space and and the deck was a great place to have our dinner on a couple of sunny evnings.  Kathy was helpful with suggestions about the area and even offered to wash our clothes when I asked about a washer/dryer.  I would certainly stay at Kathy's house again."
353347,4864503,2013-05-29,6171705,Samir,"Kathy was a great host. She prepared a little folder with information about nearby food, sights etc.The home was very clean and comfy. She even left two umbrellas for us, which turned out to be very useful. "
353347,4997553,2013-06-06,6049820,Elishka & Matthew,My husband and I stayed for 8 nights while visiting Seattle.  We especially enjoyed cooking in the great kitchen and having a BBQ out on the deck and enjoying the sunny afternoons.  The bed was very comfortable and it's a quiet area so sleeping in in the morning is a real treat.  Kathy was lovely to talk to and went out of her way to make our stay extra comfortable.  We would stay here again if we revisited.  
353347,5216777,2013-06-18,6588868,Gary,"Kathy was a fantastic host and the place was perfect. Really lovely home, super clear and beautiful. Top of the line kitchen. We used the grill and the hot tub and both were easy as can be. Beds were super comfortable.  Everything about the experience was positive."
353347,5379758,2013-06-27,6227262,Heike,"We had a wonderful stay at Kathy's place! The house is nicely placed in a quiet neighbourhoods very close to our family. Kathy  did everything to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We also had a nice BBQ on the deck. Thanks a lot!
"
353347,5748716,2013-07-15,5710679,Makiko,We had a wonderful time at the house. My parents from Japan just loved staying there!  It was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. It was so much better than hotels or motels.  Thank you! 
353347,5960893,2013-07-24,4825480,Marileen,"We highly recommend this lovely home.   It is very clean, the beds are very comfortable, the yard is lovely and the neighborhood is quiet. We were there for our son's wedding, and had several group gatherings with family and friends.  The large living room, dining room, kitchen and deck were more than adequate for our needs, and we enjoyed the use of the hot tub and fire pit several times.  The kitchen appliances are updated and the kitchen is well stocked.  We had everything we needed!   Our hostess, Kathy, was very pleasant and accommodating, She provided little extras to assure that we were comfortable.  She even bought an extra-fluffy mattress pad for the sleeper sofa!   The location in West Seattle was perfect for us, since the wedding venue was in West Seattle  Anywhere we needed to go in West Seattle was just about a 10 minute drive, with NO traffic on the neighborhood streets!  It was also very easy to access the highways to go anywhere else.  We definitely would stay here again!"
353347,6666997,2013-08-20,884777,Spencer,"Beautiful, modern house with everything to ask for.  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this quiet space.  Thanks Kathy."
353347,8997737,2013-12-01,9259385,Amanda,We enjoyed our stay at this cute home during Thanksgiving. Kathy was incredibly friendly and hospitable and made sure everything was exactly as we needed it for us and our family - she even left us a jar of jam to welcome us. Loved the long walks in the neighborhood and proximity to the water and Seattle which made it so we could have the city and still get away from it. My parents and brother were in Seattle for the first time and are still raving about how great everything was and how the home was 'just right' for us. Given it was thanksgiving I would have imagined am lot could have gone wrong - too few pots/pans/ love. Space etc but... All was great!!! Def recommend! Thanks Kathy!!
353347,14371839,2014-06-17,16301111,Pat, We traveled to Seattle for a wedding and even though the wedding was downtown we were looking for something further out. Kathy's home was a easy 15 minutes drive to downtown.  The home we rented was everything it said it was and more.  Plenty of room for all four of us with a beautiful deck and hot tub. The beds were super comfortable which was a big plus. The neighborhood is located close to the beach with beautiful views of the ocean. This was our first time using airbnb and will definitely use it again.
353347,16350053,2014-07-26,15728916,Mattias,Nice house close to the city. Quiet area. Comfortable beds. Kathy surprised us with a breakfast basket one day. Thanks a lot!
353347,17555378,2014-08-14,14724054,Carol,"This lovely, comfortable and very clean house is located in a quiet neighborhood with stores and shops just a short drive away.  The open arrangement of living room, dining room, kitchen and breakfast nook with the deck just outside the back door made for easy interaction.  Our extended family had lots of room to visit, read, relax and rest.  It was lots of fun to sit on the deck eating breakfast, visiting, talking and watching the birds.   The location was close to the site of our family reunion and to other members of our family.   Our visit to Seattle was made much more enjoyable by our stay in this fine house."
353347,18881837,2014-09-02,16573369,Joe,"The house was ready for us in a pleasant quiet neighborhood. We all enjoyed the arrangement of the kitchen with a sunlit breakfast area adjacent to the outdoor deck. This made the experience connected with the outdoors which also included a nicely maintained garden with ornamental flowers and occasional vegetables and herbs. Our kids enjoyed going to and from the deck to the kitchen whereas my wife enjoyed sitting in one of the many lounge chairs soaking in some morning sun. Parking was free adjacent to the house outside, another plus."
353347,20272312,2014-09-26,17599355,Robert,The reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
353347,40220024,2015-07-29,11245795,Octavio,"The listing was exactly. Kathy´s house is cousy, warm and easy to live. She has been very carefull in wellcoming us, accurate but with no pressure. She replied immediatelly to my questions and her daughter was also provdiding attention to our needs. She did not worry leaving us meal, coffe and welcoming gifts, more than needed utensiles at the kitchen.  Neighbourhood is calm and quiet, no noise et all. We had a great time by Kathy's home and would absolutely repeat the experience. Thanks Kathy, wonderful place."
353347,44523828,2015-08-27,13001499,Marie,Kathy was a wonderful host! She was there to answer all your questions quickly:) The home was perfect it had everything you needed and was close to all the areas you would want to see in the Seattle area. It was such a quiet neighborhood and very safe. My family and I had plenty of room and enjoyed the deck and hot tub in the evenings the most! We will definitely stay there again in our future Washington state visits.
3811872,18350269,2014-08-25,17338239,Jonny,"I had a wonderful experience at this very unique house.  Lots of guests allowed me to meet new people everyday from all over the world.  And yet, the house was so big I would only see 1 or 2 travelers a day, giving me the feeling I had the whole house to myself.  Everyone was very kind and sharing, and the neighborhood was so beautiful to walk through.  I would come back in a heartbeat!"
3811872,18689152,2014-08-30,7127759,Federico,"Beatiful views, huge house and friendly people in it :) the right place to stay at the right price!"
3811872,19256087,2014-09-08,17742495,Maged,"My stay at the house was very welcoming. It's a busy house (but still kept perfectly clean) with plenty of other interesting guests, so the place has a nice social vibe."
3811872,19809368,2014-09-18,21372747,Yusuke,"Great house, great people, and great neighborhood :)
Leah was super quick to reply to any message :)"
3811872,20175899,2014-09-24,21649434,Eric,"Gorgeous views, nice kitchen, really cool people.  Neighborhood is very residential, but bus/bikeable to what I needed.  Leah was super helpful."
3811872,20403078,2014-09-28,9745231,Jennifer,"The neighborhood is lovely and peaceful with winding roads and trees. Parking in the driveway was available, and public transportation was also convenient.  The house, dubbed the ""crayola house' is an unusual color-coded place with hardwood floors, many rooms and  shared spaces. It's no-frills and a fixer-upper, but welcoming with everything that the minimalist traveler needs. The kitchen was excellent,  the Wi-Fi was really fast, and the top bunk I slept on was really comfy. There's plenty of space for folks to spread out since it seems that many guests stay in this hostel-bungalow at any given time, and hand-written signs provide instructions and useful ""house rules."" The other guests were really nice and friendly, and I am thankful to Leah and Eric for accepting a last-minute reservation and answering my questions! "
3811872,21361522,2014-10-15,22091505,Bruno,"Great place to stay! Leah and Eric were very welcoming and generous!
Leah would bake delicious food and make it available to the guests.
The house is great, the neighborhood is very quiet and lovely!"
3811872,22772095,2014-11-14,23010120,Serene,"Helpful hosts, convient option. Other customers staying in the place were great."
3811872,26342991,2015-02-09,2866254,Frantic,Can't say enough about the Crayola house. Felt like a roomy myself. Clear guidelines. .. close proximity to down town seattle.  ($8-$11 uber).  Bunks were comfy. ... friendly people.   Plan on this being my home every time I come to Seattle!   You will love the view from the kitchen on a clear day!
3811872,28911296,2015-03-31,29664949,Neil,Great experience in a unique setting.... My first time... Highly recommend!
