823989,5715277,2013-07-13,6918282,Danny,"The place is as advertised! Very clean with comfortable beds and a homey atmosphere. Liz was absolutely great, and responded to phone calls/emails well. Would book this place again in a heartbeat."
823989,5780254,2013-07-16,5283816,Sue,"Nice, clean apartment. One mile from freeway, in a fairly commercial area, but not at all noisy. The hosts were very gracious to us."
823989,5999423,2013-07-26,5289566,Jason,"Our stay at this apartment was outstanding! The decor was excellent, and everything was neat and clean. It offers easy access to the highway and is within walking distance of bus stops.  Liz was very responsive and helpful.  Our stay exceeded our expectations; I would definitely recommend!"
823989,7486016,2013-09-22,3944168,Jonathan,"Very clean and well equipped apartment.  Beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of towels and linens.  I did find it a little musty smelling, which aggravated my allergies to mold and mildew, but that would only bother others with allergies.  Good experience and good price for two bedrooms."
823989,8475161,2013-11-01,1965904,Yam,"This place is as pictured! We are a family of 5 and the stay at this apartment was great for us. It is close to downtown and to all the places we needed to get to in Seattle. It had all the amenities we needed - most importantly, a dishwasher, which is excellent when you want to be out doing things and not inside doing dishes (plus, dishwashers waste less water than hand washing!)
The apartment is easily accessed, being on the ground floor; there was plenty of parking; it was easy to find; it was roomy and comfortable, with great furniture; private, cozy, and warm; great kitchen and bedrooms; luxurious bathroom - as you can see, a great package. Liz (the host) was very kind and communicative, and was amazing considering that she was busy with her new baby!! We'll definitely be choosing this place again for our next Seattle stay. Thank you!!"
823989,8620939,2013-11-09,6155460,Esther,"We enjoyed a lovely time in Seattle with our 3 children. There was plenty of space for all, we loved the large flatscreen TV to watch games, Liz even had some personal touches handy with a highchair for our baby! We look forward to coming again!"
823989,8822702,2013-11-19,8209331,Kimb,"This apartment is great! It's spacious and comfortable. It has all the comforts of home. The bed was even more comfortable than my bed at home! It was exactly as pictured, though seemed even more beautiful in real life. Checking in and out was super easy because of the lock box. Liz was very friendly and always available to answer my questions, but also gave me space when I didn't need anything. My only frustration was with the wireless internet. Sometimes it worked just fine and other times it was very slow."
823989,9787228,2014-01-10,10373731,Jon,"Great deal in Seattle.  For the price the apartment is very spacious and was clean. It is a bit north of downtown and is not a great neighborhood for walking, but it is a perfect home base to see the city from. "
823989,11574324,2014-04-07,13824041,Eric,Was a wonderfully comfortable home. The beds were very comfortable and the pull out couch was great! The location is very close to the highway and plenty of restaurant.

823989,12382335,2014-04-30,492602,Paul,"As advertised.  Large, comfortable space.  Very quiet location despite being so close to Aurora/99.  Easy check-in and we had no need to contact the host or on-site managers while there, which is great.  Very easy access to downtown (straight shot down Aurora/99 takes about 15 minutes - except in rush hour).  Would stay again."
823989,12931359,2014-05-14,14566851,Nathania,"The apartment was very good as described, very clean and spacious. The location is very strategic. The host was very quick to respond. However, we didn't like the smell of the apartment somehow."
823989,13141104,2014-05-20,4327104,Vincent,"The apartment was as advertised. Location was great, it was in a very safe neighborhood near downtown. Secure covered parking. The apartment itself was spacious and very clean. Complete kitchen with microwave, stove, oven and fridge. Internet service was fast. Tvs in every room. Would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. "
823989,13543056,2014-05-30,10216026,Sierra,"Andrea was perfectly polite and helpful and her apartment is exactly as it appears. The space was very clean and orderly, a perfect place to stay in Seattle on a budget. Check in was extremely easy and the building was quiet and accessible. I would absolutely stay at the Whitman Ave Suites again. Thanks Andrea!"
823989,13957278,2014-06-09,4255697,Lulu,"Andrea 's place clean and cozy. The beds are very comfortable. And we love the part that she has a TV in each room, very nice and convenient.

The apartment has a nice location. We drove to the Green Lake nearby nearly everyday. (Highly recommended) Great for taking a walk or jogging or just rest after a day's travel. Also there are two supermarkets nearby. And not to far away from downtown. Easy to drive.

Andrea is friendly and fast respond. We had a great stay at her place. Thank you for your host, Andrea!"

823989,17819045,2014-08-18,14209909,David,The Whitman Ave Suite is exactly the same description on the listing. It is a nice place for us to stay in during the vacation in Seattle.  
823989,18166018,2014-08-23,15066357,Nahyun,"Hello Andrea, 
Thank you for all services!
I really enjoyed staying in Seattle. The house was so cozy, easy to use kitchen, good qualities of beds and big enough dining room. !!! Awsome! 
Anyone who wants to stay this house while traveling, it will be a good choice!"
823989,19300064,2014-09-09,20854632,George,The place was clean and the beds were comfortable. We were very happy with our stay and had no complaints.
823989,19814201,2014-09-19,237780,Colleen,"The Whitman Ave Suites were perfect for my parents visit to Seattle after a long Alaskan Adventure. The beds were wonderful and they were able to catch up on some much needed sleep. Clean, well furnished apartment makes you feel right at home. My apartment is too small for guests so this was the perfect solution for us and very convenient (3 blocks from my apartment)."
823989,22027191,2014-10-28,12165507,Yuchen,it was real convenient to check in and check out. Rooms are exactaly as the pictures. 
823989,22596724,2014-11-10,21731422,Kristin,"The property is described accurately.  The apartment was clean & welcoming.  Furnishings & linens were tasteful & appeared to be new.  It's a great spot to base out of when exploring the city.  Works fantastic for 2 couples.  Neighborhood is great.  Within one block from E Line, which takes you downtown & within walking distance to local neighborhood restaurants & breweries.  Check in & check out times are firm, no flexibility.  We asked to check in about 1 hour early so we could make our dinner reservations & were told no.  Overall, would highly recommend.  "
823989,22710026,2014-11-12,8356871,Cheng Chung,"Place easy to find and everything was just as described. 

Communication was clear. Andrea's place suited our needs and fit 6 people comfortably."
823989,22883895,2014-11-17,20374594,Stephanie,"Decent place to stay while in Seattle, this location is centrally located. If you're looking for a comfy space with basic amenities then this will be a great pick. For the price though, there were a few details that should be addressed such as a few light fixtures not working, dark dust on the kitchen towel, bathroom sink slightly clogged, and slight musty odor. I think one thing to be aware of is the pounding footsteps/running coming from the floor above.  If these minor issues are addressed I would stay here again. Lots of space and room. FYI the heater works well but it does take a few hours to warm up. The guest book with instructions was helpful. "
823989,24008723,2014-12-16,15319852,Elke,"This place is absolutely amazing! very cozy, very close to the E bus route which takes you straight to downtown. Her place is very neat and clean, equipped with everything you need, even supplies like washing liquids etc. The mall is very close too,which was great for groceries or even shopping.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
"
823989,24805382,2015-01-03,19089448,Sam,"We stayed here over Christmas whilst visiting family and it was just perfect for what we needed. It's in a great location to allow us to get out and about and to visit family and it was the perfect size for our family of 4 and for when family came to visit us.

It's really well looked after and has everything you need for your stay, all the basics are there ready for you.

Next time we go to Seattle, hopefully this apparent will be available."
823989,25762178,2015-01-25,25803493,Abby,"Andrea, 
We enjoyed staying at the apartment. It was as described in your posting and it fit our needs for the week, and was close to other relatives we were visiting. Thanks for a good stay in Seattle."

823989,28166687,2015-03-19,21292710,Tian,"The apartment is very vice and comfortable. We lived there for 4 nights. The host provided towels and other daily necessities. The only thing is that this apartment only has one bathroom. It's not enough for 6 people. Other than this, everything is great."
823989,28351145,2015-03-22,13940837,Jimmy,Clean and quiet. Will stay there if visiting Seattle again.
823989,28802085,2015-03-30,26545104,Jocelyn,It's  a cozy place to stay over the spring break with my families. We love this suite! I didn't expect to have that many things in the kitchen. That was awesome! Andrea was so nice and very supportive to everything we needed during the stay.
823989,29306761,2015-04-06,29055256,Lauren,This place was really comfortable. It suited our group perfectly. We loved being able to have a comfortable place to come back to after some stressful days of school work. I would definitely recommend this listing to someone in the future!

823989,43051106,2015-08-17,35436219,Katy,We enjoyed our stay in the Whitman condo.  The Condo had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  Location was close to many restaurants and stores and we loved that most of the tourist attractions were within a reasonable distance. The beds were comfortable as was the living room couch.  It was nice to come home after a long day and relax in a comfortable setting.
823989,45602047,2015-09-04,34650916,Klaus-Dieter,"large rooms, can easily accommodate more than 4 guests. Good access to the highways and downtown (by car). Maybe we were not lucky -  bed linen had to be changed after we arrived (not done before) and cleaning done only the day after we arrived    "

The neighborhood was also very quiet. We used the buses so it was nice to see there was a bus stop right at the corner. We will definitely use this apartment again when we go to Seattle.

823989,55376886,2015-12-01,4440233,Haochen,Nice host. Positively helped us when we checked in. The house was a cozy one and was able to hold like 3-4 people. The sofa bed was super nice. Bedrooms were cozy and worm. The location of the house is like only 10 mins driving to university district and downtown. Recommended to all guests and visitors.

The studio had all of the amenities that I needed, even it's own private entrance where I could come and go as I pleased. Great location as well, not too far from downtown and other attractions! 
   Fabio was a great host! He is very knowledgeable about the area and has a lot of really interesting stories tool. He is very quick to respond and if you need anything he is more than willing to help make it happen! Fabio even took me out and showed me the town, my own personal tour guide! He also reminded me to turn off my interior light in my car a couple times so my battery wouldn't die!  I would highly recommend staying with Fabio while visiting Seattle!  "
902609,3985986,2013-04-01,4460064,Monica,Fabio was a great host.  I rented the location because I had some friends from out of town visiting.  I'm so glad I picked this spot.  It's right in West Seattle so very close to down town.  The location is super cute and very private.  This was a great alternative to renting a hotel room.  I didn't stay at location but I did take a peek at the spot and was really happy with everything I saw.  Thank you again! 
902609,4188588,2013-04-16,5772891,Alvin,"Our stay was great! The studio apartment was just like the pictures showed. It was very private, clean and spacious. We also had our own entrance through the back, which we loved. Fabio even provided us with water, soda and snacks. Fabio was such a great host! He was very nice and welcoming & accommodating.

Highly recommended."
902609,4411080,2013-05-03,6032750,Kelly,This was a great first air bnb experience. Fabio was a great host who made us feel welcome and checked up to make sure everything was ok during our stay but also left us to our own devices.He allowed us to use his washer and dryer which was greatly appreciated. The studio is well equipped and offers privacy from the main house which is just what we wanted from our stay. A little out of town (around 5 miles) but we had a car so was not a problem to us. Thank you for a great stay.

902609,4612441,2013-05-15,82723,Ann,"Great host! Great neighborhood! Comfortable, well appointed studio.

I loved walking two blocks from Fabio's studio to Westcrest Park, with beautiful views of downtown Seattle. The park includes wide, open space and lovely forest trails. There's a community garden, children's playground, and two dog parks - one for ""small, shy dogs.""

The dreamy mural on the studio wall adds a nice ambiance. I really liked all the furnishings. Quite a nice, contemporary look.

Try Fabio's coffee, imported from Italy. You'll find it in your kitchen, waiting for you! Along with assorted teas. He's a very considerate host. Delightful man to talk to.

Easy walk 2 blocks to catch busses. "

He was very helpful and even stocked the fridge with some drinks and breakfast items for us. He made us feel very welcome and the unit is very private. Overall, a great experience, we will be back!"
902609,4711807,2013-05-21,112877,Shandell,"Very nice and private considering it is a section in a house on lower level with a lock and key.  I felt very safe and secure.  The kitchen was a worry for me as I like to cook, but it was a perfect set up with some water and soda in the fridge.  Beautiful back yard, very peacful.  The lilac's were a great touch.  
Fabio was very generous when I forgot bath soap and even gifted me with a bag of coffee before I left.  Very sweet!  By far the best stay I have had and at the best cost.
Thank you Fabio,
Shandell Marie"
902609,4848810,2013-05-28,5897336,Jones,"This is a great place to stay for a short-to-medium length trip. There's a kitchenette with supplies, a bathroom, heating, the bed is super comfy, it's quite private, and it was quiet at night. Fabio is a great landlord/host, very helpful, friendly, flexible and responsive to communications. He provided me a parking space in his driveway, which was especially nice on days I was super tired from a day of adventures. Would stay again and recommend, a very decent choice."

Fabio is a great host, very accommodating and helpful. "
902609,6514304,2013-08-15,7468581,Susana,"Staying in this studio was very pleasant. My boyfriend and I felt right at home every time we returned from a very long day site-seeing Seattle. It was our first time visiting this city with no family or few friends around, but Fabio always communicated with us to make sure all was well making us feel at home. We were able to purchase a few groceries and store it in the studio's fridge. This really allowed us to budget really well. Studio is not too far from downtown Seattle by car. Parking was never issue because Fabio shared his drive way space. We highly recommend this place!"
902609,6705504,2013-08-22,6279670,Katherine,"Fabio was an excellent host.  He was very friendly and helpful.  The place looks exactly like the photos and is very comfortable.

902609,8257287,2013-10-22,2343011,Rilla,"Stayed for two nights with Fabio, the suite was exactly what we needed, nice layout and the kitchenette was well stocked with utensils, pots, spices, and great Italian coffee in the morning to go with breakfast! The cold drinks provided in the fridge were also a nice touch. 
The suite is outside of town, but only a 10 minute car ride into the city and close to Alki Beach where we spent one afternoon. Enjoyed Fabio's hospitality, hope to stay again next time we are in the area."

He was very helpful in getting set up, had some pamphlets about famous tourist attractions already in the room, and showed great professionalism in his interactions. The place is exactly as described and is kept in a very clean and orderly fashion. I would definitely recommend his place for anyone looking for a place very close to the city, looking for peace and quiet, and a very welcoming host. I will certainly be recommending this place to my fellow travelers!"
902609,9421611,2013-12-28,9290231,Cara,Fabio is a lovely person and gifted host. He's happy to help with any little extra thing one may need. I appreciated the cute Christmas touches he left around the studio. He made me feel welcome for the holidays.
902609,10147810,2014-02-03,10573897,Ric,"Conveniently located in West Seattle. 
Fabio is a great host and has a wonderful place. We will definitely be staying there again. A+++"
902609,10387556,2014-02-17,11297278,Bruce,"As my first AirBnB transaction, this was a good one.  Fabio responded quickly to my communications and meeting him/picking up keys was very easy.  His apartment is exactly as pictured/described and I had a very pleasant stay. He demonstrated his hospitality by offering advice, directions and even transportation options - which I did not need. I will definitely stay again when I'm back in the area, and I do recommend Fabio and his place to others who don't need a downtown Seattle location. This was great!"
902609,10730873,2014-03-04,12478942,Tania,"Fabio is a fantastic host and he really does his best to make you feel comfortable.  The place is very clean and you have everything you need.  I also enjoyed the privacy and cozy atmosphere that the studio has.  The bus stop to downtown Seattle is just a 5 minute walk so it's very convenient too. I highly recommend Fabio's studio!
"
902609,10825020,2014-03-09,8614940,Rachael,"I was in Seattle for three nights for school - Fabio's studio was so nice and SO affordable! I was surprised at how much of a difference having the added space/privacy of a full studio made - it made my trip so much better. And Fabio was an excellent host, incredibly responsive, and there was a bottle of sparkling cider waiting for me on my arrival - which was amazing. :) overall - will definetly be making a trip back."
902609,10971800,2014-03-15,11573159,Vuong,Contacted Fabio a little last minute. He was very accommodating.  Very nice space. Great amenities like water soda and snacks.  Highly recommend.
902609,11025814,2014-03-17,3394851,Dorothea,"Our stay at Fabio's exceeded our expectations.He was reliable,friendly,punctual and had prepared a very comfortable,immaculately clean lodging for us.The added treat of warm baked bread and sweet treat was delicious!  Would heartily recommend his studio to others. "
902609,11399179,2014-04-01,4902078,Sara,"I absolutely LOVED my stay in this apartment! All of the furnishings are so comfortable, and it has a great little kitchen area and nice big bathroom. I was able to enjoy a sunny (yes, sun in Seattle!) afternoon reading out on the deck, which overlooks the lovely backyard. It's a short walk away from a variety of shops, and it's near multiple different bus stops, so you can easily get around West Seattle and downtown. It is a great neighborhood, and I had a really enjoyable walk down to the Fauntleroy ferry stop, which is about 2 miles away.

Fabio couldn't have been more courteous and helpful! My flight got in late at night, and he was still there to welcome me and help me get my things carried down to the apartment. He checked in to make sure I had everything I needed and even helped me fix my phone when it had a little meltdown! Checking out was easy, and it's a short cab ride (15 min. or so) to SeaTac airport, so getting to and from the apartment is convenient.

I would definitely recommend Fabio as a host, and his apartment is a great option if you are traveling to the Seattle area! I would love to stay there again the next time I visit!"
902609,12288729,2014-04-28,4483465,Michaele,"Wonderful place to stay!  I had the pleasure of staying in Fabio's studio for about a week.  It's attached to the back of his single-family home, underneath the deck.  Though it did get rather chilly, 2 heaters were provided, which warmed it up a bit.  Fabio's sweet mom, who was visiting for the month, was nice enough to give me some sweets she baked.  The satellite tv wasn't very reliable, to be honest but if you're on the go exploring Seattle, this may not be an issue for you. Fabio was so kind, even inviting me to celebrate his bday w/ he and and friends! I would recommend having a rental car, as you'll be about 20 minutes from downtown but if you're looking for a home away from home, this is it!"
902609,12621289,2014-05-06,4124141,E.J.,"What else can I add that hasn't already been said? Fabio is the man. He hosted my fiancé and I in his studio. He kept good communication with me the whole time and he even let me park my rental car in his driveway the whole time I was there. The studio was spotless and spacious. He had a well stocked fridge with water and soft drinks, along with some snacks and a bottle of sparkling cider to await us. The wifi worked prefect, along with the heater that he provided. I had the opportunity to meet Fabio when we checked in, but couldn't tell him goodbye since we had a very early flight the next day. He did send me a text though, which was pretty cool. Loved the neighborhood and if ever I'm in town again, I would definitely inquire about Fabio's place. Grazie! "
902609,12889108,2014-05-13,13622193,Krystl (Omni),"Wow what an AMAZING place to stay with what I have to say is the worlds friendliest and most courteous host I've ever had the pleasure of booking with during my travels.

Fabio goes above and beyond the level of ANY 4.5 star service you would expect in a hotel with his studio for rent. Clean, spacious,  beautifully designed, and comfortable this IS the place to stay. Cider on arrival, complimentary drinks in the fridge, tea, coffee and the delightful surprise of oven fired pizza & fresh Mustazzoli (Italian Honey Bread) it was hard to leave this place to go out and explore Seattle.

Fabio was always on hand to help with any questions or requests either in person or via text when you stay.  There is an even balance of privacy and warm welcome at this place far more than I've felt ever,  elsewhere in a retail establishment.
"
902609,13049444,2014-05-18,2168789,Kimberly,Cool place. I enjoyed staying at Fabio's studio. He have me a tip of local places to check out and the area is just great. As long as you have wheels it's a great alternative to downtown Seattle. 
902609,13163467,2014-05-20,12852684,Julia,Fabio is a great host! The apartment is super clean and very nice. Everything you need is there. I definitely recommend this apartment!
902609,13311906,2014-05-25,12040054,Kristyn,Fabio's studio is definitely awesome! We had a great experience here. It was clean and was in a great location. Away from downtown but less than 20 minutes from anywhere you'd want to go! Fabio was very accommodating and a very nice guy! I would definitely recommend staying here.
902609,13519684,2014-05-29,1209417,Peony,Everything went smoothly and as expected! Fabio was great :)
902609,13629926,2014-06-01,11788576,Nathan,"Fabio's studio was great.  It was very clean, private, and close to public transit.  In addition, Fabio is a great host.  He left the fridge full of sodas and several other treats in the kitchen. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
902609,13904069,2014-06-07,16402175,Timothy,"Fabio was a great host, everything we could have needed was thought of and ready for us. We would highly recommend for anyone needing to stay in The Seattle area. We called late in the evening and Fabio's response was quick and professional, we were able to check in with no issues."
902609,13997284,2014-06-09,8562198,Krista,"I couldn't be happier to have found Fabio's place-clean, cool looking(hand drawn mural on the wall, elevated bath tub) and all-you-need items provided (even a sewing kit amongst other things! And yes, even Martinelli's, 3 kinds of soda, bottled water and Italian coffee!). Parking is plenty(4 cars in his parking lot) but street parking is no-brainer easy and never had been a problem! His backyard is big and was so nice to fully enjoy when he invited us to hangout with a firepit going. It would have been nice to have tried his fire oven pizza (set-up in his backyard) but we were too late. This place is #1 on our go-to place when we come back to Seattle!"
902609,14204854,2014-06-14,786142,Carter,"Was working in Seattle for the week and needed a place on relatively short notice. Fabio's space fit the bill perfectly. It is off the beaten path, being in White Center, but for the adventure it is located in a very comfortable neighborhood, close to major freeways. It is obvious that Fabio has hospitality experience as a lot of touches and extras were automatically provided and he is an attentive host.  The apartment is well furnished and very comfortable, with a nice private porch and access to a park like back yard. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone."
902609,14409241,2014-06-18,10999753,Johnny,Fabios place is so cute and well designed. Very true to the photographs. He was a gracious host & easy to get a hold without breathing down our necks. Will definitely be staying again if I'm ever in seattle.
902609,14484356,2014-06-20,13364937,Kelly,"Fabio has a very nice unit that has all the amenities. The unit is spacious, quiet, and close to many things. I met Fabio the first night and he is extremely nice and welcoming. Thanks again for the great stay and we just met your friends Tony and Mike. "
902609,14698127,2014-06-24,6742917,Loretta,"Our experience was excellent at the Awesome Studio in West Seattle.  It is not downtown Seattle but close enough to drive to when you want to go. We were here to visit family in West Seattle so this worked out perfect for us.  The two most important things for us when we stay somewhere is cleanliness and safety.  The studio was clean and felt very safe.  Fabio was an excellent host.  Just like the other reviewers have written, he is a very likable young man. Spent sometime talking with him, he is very pleasant and his desire to make your stay perfect is very obvious.  He is friendly, well mannered, attentive. Will be staying there again when in Seattle.  He lives upstairs which I felt was a positive.  Has a back yard with picnic table if you wanted could be out side enjoying the Seattle weather. "
902609,15756991,2014-07-15,13308898,Debra,"I had a wonderful stay at Fabio's  ""Awesome Studio"".  Fabio was a wonderful host who was attentive to any need that I had regarding the Studio, including bringing me a fan and extra washcloths. The refrigerator was stocked with water and soda which was a nice touch. There was also coffee and tea. The Studio was clean and had everything I needed for making meals, plus an iron, ironing board and hair dryer.  Fabio was friendly and his studio was within walking distance to my daughter's apartment. The neighborhood was quite and safe and you have your own entryway in the back of the house. I would definitively stay at Fabio's again when I get to travel out to that area to visit my daughter and her family in the future."
902609,17047706,2014-08-06,11977971,Anhthu,"Fabio was so nice and welcoming. He provided snacks, drinks and tea for us, which was very generous of him to do. We were provided with plenty of towels, an iron, and a hairdryer, all of which were put to good use. It was kind of hot in the room and it appeared that the air conditioning was either not turned on or turned on very low. However, there was a fan provided for us that helped with the summer heat. Overall, we had a great experience!"
902609,17179538,2014-08-08,19115173,John,"Fabio was great and so was the studio... private, quite, and comfortable."
902609,17349756,2014-08-11,16634134,Malcolm,"Clean, comfortable apartment with all the amenities that I needed like wireless Internet, full kitchen, iron, etc. The host was very easy to work with, facilitating a late arrival. He gave us total privacy. Great experience. "
902609,17679032,2014-08-16,9995895,Paul,"This was a lovely place to stay and it had everything I possibly could have needed. It was a very short walk to the bustop into town and there's also some shops that aren't too far away. 
The studio was clean and comfortable and Fabio is a really nice guy. "
902609,17947707,2014-08-19,17851366,Andrew,"Fabio was extremely hospitable and clearly cleaned every inch of the apartment prior to our arrival. He even leaves little snacks and drinks around the apartment and in the fridge. Everything was wonderful, I would definitely stay again when visiting Seattle!"
902609,18335953,2014-08-25,4018752,Hans & Cindy,"We had an awesome stay at Fabio's place. He was very clear and quick to respond to any of our questions and very flexible to meet our needs (we let him know we would arrive late on the first night of our stay).

The studio is exactly as displayed in the pictures and very comfortable for a prolonged stay in Seattle. We had our own car, so we can't comment on public transportation, but getting to downtown Seattle from Fabio's place was very easy.

Fabio also invited us for Pizza on our second night, and since he's Italian we weren't going to decline that offer and were glad we didn't! He went well out of his way to welcome us in person and to make sure we had a good time, and the (home-made) Pizza was awesome!

All things considered Fabio is a truly wonderful host, with a very nice & comfortable place not too far from downtown Seattle, we would absolutely recommend staying with him and will surely do so if we ever return to the Seattle area. "
902609,18544240,2014-08-28,15313122,Kry Sta,"The place was cute and just perfect for what we needed. Fabio wasn't around when we got there but he was helpful on the phone and came to meet us when he could.  He had snacks and drinks there for us and the place was clean.  It was farther out of the city than we liked. We made that work with Lyft, sidecar and uber. Most first rides are free. Plus the bus stops were close by. Good host. Thanks."
902609,19460043,2014-09-13,2573435,Susan,"Fabio is an awesome host and his studio space is just perfect!   The bed is comfortable with all the amenities you will need.  Coffee, water and soda are stocked in the full size refrigerator.  Loved the private deck/porch and the beautiful yard with lots of grapes and tomatoes.  I would certainly stay here again next time I come to Seattle.  Thanks again, Fabio, for your generous hospitality!"
902609,20017725,2014-09-22,18653462,Christina,"Staying at Fabio's studio was great! The space is exactly as depicted and described and was super comfortable and might I add the perfect little haven to arrive to after driving for almost 13 hours. The fridge was stocked with soda and water,  coffee was perfect and everything was super clean and organized! My favorite part of staying at his studio besides the lovely quiet neighborhood was hanging out with Lemon, the cat, on the back porch :) I would say my boyfriend's favorite part was being able to catch up on football on the big tv when we were relaxing before or after activities!

For my first trip to Seattle and my boyfriend's third trip, we believe we made an excellent choice in staying at Fabio's studio and would definitely consider it when coming back. Or maybe even moving to that neighborhood, it's so cute!"
902609,20218141,2014-09-25,15426713,Alan,A very cute studio in a nice quiet neighborhood.
902609,20430829,2014-09-29,6315555,Victor,Fabio's place was awesome. We had a wonderful stay. The neighbor was quiet and was easy and close to get to and around Seattle by car. Fabio was easy to contact and was very willing to help if we needed anything. Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Seattle. Thanks Fabio!
902609,21166894,2014-10-12,7140186,Erik,"We just finished a 2 night stay at Fabio's place and it was great. Nice studio apartment layout with everything you need including the most friendly cat I think I have been around that just wants to play.  Lemon the cat just comes to visit and say hi occasionally, so no worries if you don't like cats, he won't be living with you. Fabio's place is nice and clean, separate entrance and is very quiet. Great safe feeling neighborhood that is not too far away from all the activity going on in downtown West Seattle. Refrigerator is well stocked with cold beverages and there is also coffee as well. We met Fabio on our way out on Sunday morning and he was very very nice. Great place at a very reasonable price."
902609,21355999,2014-10-15,18281946,Jackson,Fabio's place was very clean and extremely cozy. My mom stayed at his house and it was her first Airbnb experience. She really loved it. 
902609,22080635,2014-10-29,20523702,Gabe,"Fabio's place is really nice--artwork on the wall is a nice touch. Studio was comfortable and had all the necessary comforts. Pretty close to downtown and the airport, and comes with a friendly cat who inhabits the area outside the room. "
902609,22336916,2014-11-03,1008024,Annette,"The spacious studio was clean and comfortable and located in a quiet residential neighborhood. Fabio was friendly and very pleasant to deal with. He provided a ride from the airport, for a fee. The kitchen & fridge were well stocked. Bus 125 to downtown Seattle was close by. The shopping center was within walking distance."
902609,22541436,2014-11-09,9455337,Kathleen,"I enjoyed the spaciousness and cleanliness of the studio. Fabio was very cordial. He immediately replied to each of my online and phoned questions. The studio is convenient to shopping.

I recommend Fabio's studio for all travelers but those such as I who are not so steady in their footing. Guests have to walk to the back for entrance and I found this challenging since there were slightly different levels in places and no railings. Rolling my suitcase to the back was a bit rough. Fabio had installed bright lighting on the path which was a help."
902609,23039101,2014-11-21,9330821,Danielle,"Fabio was attentive and fun. His studio was exactly as described and overall a great time. I had to work more than expected so I didn't get a chance to hang out with Fabio as much as hoped. Overall, this spot is great to checkout West Seattle and a  short hop nearly everywhere. I;d highly recommend this place and stay again. "
902609,23231011,2014-11-25,23932710,Luke,"Fabio's place was a perfect first experience with airbnb.  I had a fairly rushed last minute work schedule for this trip, so the convenience, cleanliness and quiet comfort was perfect.  Everything worked was as advertised and I wouldn't hesitate to book with Fabio for my next trip. The Italian flair with the faux stone wall and a few photos from Italy brought back a some fond memories of my trip to Italy a few years back.  Easy access to several main bus lines, a quiet neighborhood and an organized host, made this the ideal selection for this busy professional on foot.  
Download the OneBusAway app while you're there and you'll see downtown buses running just a block away every 10-15 minutes.  A valuable convenience for the carless Seattle traveler."
902609,23583577,2014-12-05,9330821,Danielle,Second time I stayed and almost felt as home. Fabio's communication was excellent
902609,24904631,2015-01-03,9540258,Phil,"The listing was accurate, the neighborhood was safe, the host was accomodating, and we had a great time. Thanks!"
902609,25152285,2015-01-07,11719033,Rebecca,"Listing accurate, neighborhood easy to navigate, and convenient for my purposes, and Fabio was accessible and helpful!"
902609,25280897,2015-01-11,14632739,Ben,"Nice little spot for a quick getaway. Had everything I needed and more, thank you for sticking the fridge with water bottles! Parking is right in front and is very convenient. Freeways are closeby. Quiet neighborhood. It was nice meeting you Fabio!"
902609,26027862,2015-02-01,26658294,Kegan,"Very nice, very clean. Enjoyed my stay and felt welcomed. Nice way to be introduced to my new home."
902609,26449342,2015-02-13,25476433,Weiqi,"Fabio is the best host I ever met. The day I got there is super bowl, he invited me to his party upstairs, and it was so cool. I end up to be friends with Fabio's friend. And as long as Fabio is capable, he will try to help you. 
The place is really cozy and nice. Everything is really clean and makes you really comfortable. The location is pretty good, there are bus stops close to you and also a big shopping mall. 
Thank you Fabio, I had a really good time staying in your studio!"
902609,26695257,2015-02-17,26549980,Ana,Fabio is a great host. The place was clean and comfortable and he made himself available to us in case we needed something. The yard is beautiful. I would definitely recommend Fabio and his space to friends and family. 
902609,27218774,2015-02-28,21509048,Dawn,"Fabio's place was our home away from home after we relocated from the East Coast. We stayed at this lovely studio for 10 days in February while apartment hunting in Seattle.  Everything was clean and all the amenities were taken care of.  Fabio checked in with us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed, and was easily reached by phone or text.  We enjoyed the easy access to Seattle by car, and the cute Alki Beach area just up the road.  Highly recommended for those needing a place to land in Seattle, or as a home base while sightseeing or visiting family. "
902609,28708196,2015-03-29,27071145,Kevin,"I stayed with Fabio for just shy of two weeks in March as I transitioned from out-of-state and needed a place to stay for a little bit as I began a new job. Fabio was a responsive, nice, and an accommodating host.  He definitely adds his own Italian flair, and brings a little bit of Italy to the basement studio in many facets. Fabio, and his brother who lives with him (cool guy) are  right above you if you need anything.  The studio has most everything you need and would say it's a good place to stay for a few days. Initially I had booked for a longer stay but my situation changed fairly quickly and I moved on to something a little more longer-term. Point being is the refund policy between Fabio and I was pretty easy and he Helped to make sure I was refunded all my money for a canceled reservation.  But again, if you're looking for a quaint place to stay for a few day visit to Seattle Fabio's place is also good as a hub and short drive to major highways taking you right to Seattle or easy south access to the airport. Thank you Fabio, appreciate your hosting me and hope our paths cross again one day.  Oh and shout out to Lemon the cat, saw him mentioned in other reviews and definitely a cool little guy. Thanks again."
902609,29690531,2015-04-11,23674057,Janie,"Fabio was very gracious and hospitable, introducing himself and asking if everything was to my liking.  The studio was was clean, there was fresh coffee available as well as bottled water and soda in the fridge (a nice touch!).  The bed was not as comfortable as I would have hoped, but it was certainly adequate.  I had no difficulty turning on the TV, but the reception was mostly inconsistent (didn't appear to have a cable connection).  I think Fabio should leave a little instruction for guests regarding the shower curtain: as I discovered, if it's not positioned just right there can be flood of water on the bathroom floor.  Overall, I had a positive experience and would recommend the studio to others.  "
902609,30394941,2015-04-21,28836940,Sara,Fabio has the perfect studio! He was very friendly and attentive! He was also very flexible! I would stay here again if I was back in the area!
902609,31222437,2015-05-03,26184364,Lori,"Fabio was out of town the weekend we stayed in his studio apartment, but he went out of his way to ensure that we had access and gave us his brother's contact information in case we needed anything.  He telephoned me prior to our arrival, giving me detailed information about where the key would be.  Upon arrival, we found that Fabio had left refreshments in the refrigerator, coffee, and even a bag of gummy bears on the table for us!  Even though he was out of town visiting friends, Fabio texted me the next day to make sure everything was OK and to see if we needed anything.  The studio was nicely decorated and clean.  It was very quiet whenever we were there and we were never disturbed by outside noise.  The neighborhood appeared to be quiet and well kept.  "
902609,31731850,2015-05-09,786142,Carter,"As always, Fabio was immediately responsive, and his place was comfortable with a lot of amenities to make it feel welcoming, yet private.  The location is in SW Seattle, which is an area that is convenient for me working in Auburn.  I really appreciated the coffee, his own brew, and the comfort of the place overall; this was my second time staying here.  Fabio even provided a parking space in his driveway.   Certainly a place I would recommend."
902609,31964457,2015-05-12,5901197,Eki,Thank you for your hospitality Fabio
902609,32594473,2015-05-19,31740021,John,Fabio was a gracious host! Everything that we needed was provided for us. He made sure we were settled in and that everything was to our likening. Thank you Fabio for a great time. We will be returning to Seattle. We loves your city.
902609,34074935,2015-06-04,32614385,Tiara,Our stay at Fabio's place was splendid. Fabio came by to make sure we settled in ok. He was very responsive and very accommodating to our late night check in. The unit was clean and the refrigerator was filled with water and other kind of drinks.  We loved the patio that was facing the back yard. It was a nice touch to the unit. We will definitely stay at Fabio's the next time we visit Seattle.
902609,34469044,2015-06-08,327137,Robert,"This was a great stay for me. Easy to find, nice n'hood, private space, and big, clean and functional. Very comfortable with all the amenities. 

This was home base for me for the time I was exploring around the Seattle area. Highly recommend for the Westside.

Fabio was friendly and easy to talk to. We did not talk much as I was in/out most of my stay but told him he has a really great accommodation. 

Stay here is you want 'neighborhoody'"
902609,35675881,2015-06-21,1930896,Laura,"Fabio's place was really amazing. It was exactly what we needed for our stay in Seattle. The location is a little outside the city center but is conveniently located. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to all of this looking for a easy and relaxing stay in Seattle. 

Thanks Fabio! "
902609,36414470,2015-06-28,2845054,Claudia,"Fabio was an exceptional host! We had to make some changes to our trip and he was incredibly accommodating. He is generous and kind and the unit is exactly as it looks on the site. Everything was clean and comfortable.
I'd rather stay at Fabio's when I visit Seattle again rather than stay somewhere downtown."
902609,37479338,2015-07-07,34524916,Andrew,"The place was great! Had everything we needed. The kitchenette allowed for us to cook some meals at home to avoid eating out every meal and the mounted TV provided for some stay in entertainment.

It was also just the right distance from a lot of the major hiking zones, which is definitely a plus."
902609,38009298,2015-07-12,19483460,Kimberly,Fabio is a wonderful host and has a fully equipped studio in Trendy artsy West Seattle. We enjoyed your apartment and would gladly stay there again. Thank you
902609,38620326,2015-07-17,35662271,Samuel,"Fabio's space was functional, well-furnished, and felt like a home away from home. Very clean, very well-decorated. "
902609,39036274,2015-07-20,35801646,Tim And Cass,"Thank you Fabio.  Great accommodations, spotless, quiet & had everything we needed. Loved having coffee when we arrived."
902609,39356836,2015-07-22,9421084,Jonathan,Very good stay. Great espresso knowledge and recommendations!
902609,39903902,2015-07-27,22957144,Gemma,"Fabio was a very friendly and attentive host. He visited the apartment a few times during my stay just to check I had everything I needed and that I was finding my way around Seattle ok.

The apartment was clean and tidy and the fridge was stocked with water and coke which was a nice surprise!

Being a ground floor apartment there was some noise from upstairs. If you want a quiet stay this may be something to consider. The shower head is also quite low! I'm 5'5"" and had to bend to use it.

The apartment is a little out of the city but there are a few bus routes which take you Downtown and it only takes 20 mins or so.

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking for a comfortable stay with a friendly and considerate host."
902609,40617345,2015-08-01,36832791,Sofia,"Fabio is a gracious host. He is attentive and genuinely made us feel at home. The listing description is just as pictured. We felt safe and comfortable. He brews his own coffee, Mio, which he graciously provided. His kitchenette made it convenient for us to make meals. He  even invited us to join his family for an authentic Italian pizza dinner right from his brick oven. It was a lovely experience. We would stay here again. Thank you Fabio!"
902609,41202069,2015-08-05,2717756,Rob,"Fabio's place was great and he was an exceptional host.
Did anything and everything he could to make our stay as good as possible. He had thought of everything that was needed for our stay, had a HDMI and VGA cable ready and waiting for us to use with the TV.
Cannot recommend this place enough, awesome neighborhood, great apartment. 

"
902609,42276069,2015-08-12,13635313,Sandra,"Staying at Fabio's apartment was a very nice experience.  Fabio was warm, welcoming and provided lots of information for the area.  The apartment was very clean and had everything needed for an enjoyable stay.  Nice touches included coffee and other beverages.  The apartment is in a quiet location that is close to the bus that runs to downtown Seattle.  When returning I would definitely stay at this apartment."
902609,43230780,2015-08-18,33741705,Tiffany,"We had a nice time staying at Fabio's place.  It was exactly what we were looking for, and as described on the website.  The close proximity to the bus stop made it easy to get around Seattle without needing a car. 
 We appreciated the flexibilty (opportunity to drop off luggage early) with check-in time for our early flight, while still accommodating other guests too. 
This was our first ARIBNB experience, and it was a good first to have.  Thank you."
902609,44303590,2015-08-25,35563620,Maggie,"Very homey.  We did not meet Fabio, as he was out of town, but his brother was very helpful and friendly! Beautiful place and backyard. The shower head is pretty low and there are not a lot of dishes, but would stay here again! "
902609,45078614,2015-08-31,33368036,Audra,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Fabio since he was out of country during our stay. However, he would check in on us through email to make sure our stay was going well. He also gave us his brother's number so if we needed anything he could assist us! The place was very clean and extremely quiet! The location was great, only 15 minute drive from the downtown area. Definitely a nice place to stay when visiting Seattle!"
902609,45481700,2015-09-03,37378217,Marc,"The studio was perfect for what we needed.  We were about 15 minutes away from downtown Seattle.  There was a grocery store and Target a few miles away which made it easy for anyone looking to pick up groceries during their stay.  It was a little cold but the heater provided was key!  Fabio even went the extra mile by providing drinks and some snacks for his guests.  He was also quick in responding to any of our needs or concerns, the definition of a great host. Lastly, he parking situation was seamless.  He allowed us to park on the driveway, which was great when traveling with a little one. "
902609,45944039,2015-09-07,7487233,Michelle,"Had a great time at Fabio's place! 

He is such a wonderful host. I loved that his place was thoughtfully arranged. At first my husband and I were worried because we weren't located in the heart of downtown. But this location was great and worked out perfectly! Downtown parking is awful/expensive. Fabio's place is not far at all. It takes only 10 minutes to get to downtown (not to mention the drive is beautiful). 

Fabio's place is very clean and organized. There are brochures and magazines available with things to do in the area. All the amenities we needed were there (shampoo, soap, blowdryer, kitchen, ect). He even had umbrella's in case we got caught up in rain. He is so thoughtful!

We'll definitely be back to Seattle! Thank you again for a wonderful stay!"
902609,46808139,2015-09-13,43293267,Bryan,Your place is great!  Very clean and comfortable.  The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and easy to access from Seattle.  I will recommend your place to family and friends.  
902609,47909622,2015-09-21,26262243,Callie,"We had a wonderful time at Fabio's place! It was in a great location near the bus and close to downtown! It was small and quaint and he did everything he could to make us feel comfortable and enjoy our time in Seattle! He even left drinks in the fridge for us, what a wonderful surprise!! We will definitely book with Fabio the next time we go to Seattle! Thank you for a great time! "
902609,48306635,2015-09-25,15320152,Flora Sanchez,"I felt very safe and comfortable here. Fabio met me outside when my taxi pulled up and carried my luggage in. 

The rental description was accurate. It was warm and cozy and I liked that Fabio had a room heater available. 

Although it didn't rain, to speak of, the porch was nice to have and it opens to the backyard, which was clean and open, and this made it comfortable to just have the door open, or sit outside.

The shower and bath combo, always great to have. And the couch was comfortable enough to sleep on "
902609,49391158,2015-10-03,2944471,Michelle,"Fabio was an excellent host! The place was perfect for a getaway and we felt right at home . 


Thank you so much for letting us stay there Fabio! 

Sincerely, 

Elle & Teddy "
902609,50522021,2015-10-12,3502380,Andy,"Fabio was fabulous - welcoming and helpful, but also respectful of privacy.  The studio was just as advertised.   I would happily stay here again if available when back in Seattle."
902609,51379484,2015-10-19,46172681,Craig,"Our accommodation was just as billed.  Fabio left us great coffee for the coffee maker as well as a refrigerator stocked with bottled water and a few other things.  The location was perfect for me as my daughter lives only a few blocks away.  I enjoyed walks in some beautiful parks in West Seatle (Lincoln Park especially) and my daughter knew a many great places to eat and have coffee.

I look forward to visiting again in the future."
6120046,30745986,2015-04-26,13794291,Lisa & Terry,Megan was a very accommodating host. I had a question when I first arrived and she answered her phone immediately. She has the cottage full of all kinds of eclectic items and it made the stay very unique. For the price it is unmatched with having access to the whole place and being in a location so close to great views of the water and the skyline of Seattle. While still being able to walk to a variety of restaurants  and bars. I would definitely stay there again.  
6120046,32129346,2015-05-14,12271107,Antoinette,"The cottage is in a great location --very central. Fremont offers much in the way of restaurants, cafes, pubs, yoga, music venues, a great organic market nearby (PCC) and quaint shops. Lots of busses run through here so if pretty quick to get almost anywhere in Seattle. The decor is very hippy grandma eclectic as described, with a comfy couch to relax on. As a longtime San Franciscan, I found this very familiar and charming. The highlight was the amazing tempurpedic mattress that felt like sleeping on a cloud. Wifi got spotty towards the end of my stay, which made it difficult to do my late night remote work, but it forced me in the daytime to get out and enjoy the great cafes nearby. p.s. shower has great water pressure."
6120046,32997399,2015-05-24,28723095,Bethany,"Great location. Very central to Fremont and so much to do in the area. We easily found the public dock access to the lake and could walk everywhere. Walking is great, however, I suggest you take public transport to the house. Parking is limited and was very hard to find anything more than 2 or 3 hrs nearby, and so I had to keep moving my car. Sunday Fremont market was awesome! Megan was very welcoming and the house had everything we needed. Great spot to stay!"
6120046,35091448,2015-06-15,1021226,Diane,Limited contact but friendly and fast in getting back to us.
6120046,35444005,2015-06-18,31023980,Anibal,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6120046,35924435,2015-06-23,13227284,Jessica & Luke,"Megan was super easy to communicate with prior to our arrival.  Didn't need to contact her during our stay.
Location is AWESOME. Down the street from a great brewery, access to running/cycling paths along the water, tons of restaurants & bars.  Only 20 min to downtown by public transport.  We loved Fremont!"
6120046,38843394,2015-07-19,33430609,Ericka,"The location of this place is outstanding for a first trip to Seattle.  This isn't a luxurious, sterile hotel -- it has far more personality. Megan was out of town during our stay, but she made sure we were comfortable reaching her or the neighbors if we needed anything.  

We had a terrific time exploring the area on foot.  When we did drive, parking wasn't as difficult as we anticipated, and it was surprisingly quiet at night for as busy as the area is.  This was a great home base for our trip."
6120046,40331174,2015-07-30,5379059,Melissa,"The LOCATION was awesome. It was so great to sit outside, have a view of some of the city, be within a few blocks of great food and an excellent microbrewery, and Fremont is such a great neighborhood. The lake was just a block away. We walked the 2 miles to UW and rented bikes. The apartment was comfortable and fun to be in. The bus system was easy to use, esp. for going downtown (if you don't need a car, don't get one--you'll need to pay for daytime parking). Megan was very helpful in the lead-up to our trip and was easy to contact once we got there, to answer a few questions."
6120046,41932114,2015-08-10,2080099,Erin,Great location - walking/biking distance to a lot of restaurants/bars in a fun neighborhood! Accommodations were cozy. 
6120046,44894119,2015-08-30,1668934,Donald & Susan,"The ""Lake View Cottage"" in Fremont is a short work to shops and cafes and a short but hilly walk down to the waterfront.  The bed was comfortable.  There is no wifi if that is important to you.  Megan has highly decorated the apartment in a highly personal style with small personal objects everywhere and on every surface. We only stayed two of the 4 nights we had booked so we  had brief contact with Megan.  If you are a compulsive ""neatnik"" who likes things in order this might not be the place for you."
4410544,22553246,2014-11-09,4531642,Ketan,"Great location, great building, and great apt! Well decorated. I would highly recommend staying there."
4410544,23920873,2014-12-14,22067426,Olivia,"When my mother was moved into Swedish Hospital from where we live in Alaska, I was in a bind and needed a place near the hospital to stay with a couple of my family members while my mother was admitted.  When I found Miranda's apartment on AIRB&B, it looked amazing and I booked it as soon as I could. Miranda and the beautiful apartment  were simply AMAZING! She was very responsive to all of my questions, met me at the door of the apartment, showed me around and made sure my family and I were 100% comfortable.  She was exactly what my family needed during this tough time. She has gone above and beyond to help us in any way possible. If you are going to stay in Seattle, Miranda is the best possible person to work with and I cannot recommend her highly enough! Thank you for everything Miranda, we can't thank you enough!"
4410544,24275608,2014-12-24,24244325,Anthony,Very nice experience! And a great place to live! 
4410544,24386491,2014-12-27,13270887,George,We had a lovely Christmas in Miranda and Mike's beautiful apartment in Seattle. They were extremely helpful and well organised and the apartment was in immaculate condition. 
4410544,24455931,2014-12-28,6430679,Donna,I've stayed at Miranda and Mike's apartments multiple times and they've always been top notch.
4410544,24755151,2015-01-02,23231441,Jixi,"Great place to live, close to anywhere and everything is easy to use."
4410544,25238667,2015-01-10,23900072,Emmaris,"Miranda was a great host and the apartment was amazing. It was very spacious and clean, and we were even welcomed with a complimentary bottle of wine. The area surrounding the apartment was safe and the Japanese restaurant across the street was the best! Very close to the convention center and pike place market. Highly recommend"
4410544,26069677,2015-02-02,26060092,Rachel,"A great place to stay. Clean, comfortable and convenient. Walking distance to the fish market and convention center. I really enjoyed my stay here. Much more spacious than a hotel room plus a kitchen and comfortable beds!"
4410544,26285320,2015-02-08,14269336,John,"Miranda and Mike's place is a great location in First Hill above the downtown area and easy walking distance to Capitol Hill and other hotspots in the area.  The apartment is well appointed with all you need for a short or long term stay.  Miranda is a fantastic host; easy to communicate with and very accommodating, the bottle of wine was much appreciated after a long day of travel.  I definitely recommend this place and would consider staying again if back in this part of Seattle."
4410544,27757370,2015-03-11,14868993,Jarming,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here. It was clean, fully furnished, and great location. It is located near downtown so Pike Market is 15 mins walk away. We all loved staying there. Eve was very nice host. She made sure we had everything we needed. She is always one text away. Eve was very helpful and understanding! I will definitely use this location again! "
4410544,28146522,2015-03-18,2471501,Michael,"Great stay, thanks for your hospitality!"

4410544,28705219,2015-03-29,25109134,Lawrence,We are a group of 3 in Seattle for an international conference. The apt. is at a really good location and nicely furnished. Only 10-15 minutes walk to the downtown area. Our host was very helpful in checking us in and providing extra supplies. We particularly love the coffee shop at the the corner of the same building.  Highly recommended!   
4410544,29269798,2015-04-06,24124324,Brittany,"This unit was amazing! We attended a convention at the nearby WSCC and the walking distance was just perfect. The beds were comfortable, there was in-unit laundry, and a coffee shop downstairs that's perfect for a morning pick me up. Eve was very helpful and willing to assist with anything, and we had a lovely time in a lovely unit. "
4410544,29736326,2015-04-12,174634,Teresa,"The condo was as listed, located in a nice area that was convenient to the convention center, and met all of our needs.  Eve was very easy to communicate with and got back to us very quickly whenever we had a question.  

When we arrived, Eve met us at the condo right away, and showed us around. The place was quiet, clean, and bright with a nice open view.  We enjoyed our stay!"
4410544,30385311,2015-04-21,17350115,Allison,"Eve was great! She was extremely kind and accommodating. Anytime I had a question or request, she would respond immediately (within half an hour) doing her best to fulfill my wishes. The place is also very clean and centrally located in a safe neighborhood with lots to do within a 15 min walk. The rooftop also has a nice patio deck with a grill. The building itself is quiet. I would highly recommend!"
4410544,32377747,2015-05-17,9863766,Teuta,"Excellent downtown location, great hosts, clean space :)"
4410544,33083790,2015-05-25,29075176,Ross,Great location in downtown Seattle. Apartment is extremely clean and quiet. Eve was very helpful in making sure we had everything we needed and quite welcoming. 
4410544,33787576,2015-06-01,11136684,Gabrielle,"This property was perfect. We were two couples staying in the condo and had plenty of room. We each had our own room and the washroom was spacious and clean. We dealt with Eva through airbnb messaging and she was great. Eva made sure that our stay was to our liking. At one point we needed a few more towels and the next day we had towels just like that. Beds were comfy.

The location was great. Everything was in walking distance from down town. The walk back to the condo was a little hilly, but with the amount of food we ate walking felt great "
4410544,34525500,2015-06-09,20450497,Bradford,We had a great time. The apt was even better than the picture. Eve met us and let us in to the unit and was very accommodating. The wine gift was greatly appreciated. I will stay here again if I can.
4410544,35372209,2015-06-18,22355465,Julie,"The apartment was exactly as described, maybe even better than we pictured it. Although we did not meet Eve in person (we arrived later than expected), we felt welcome at any time, and Eve gave detailed instructions on everything, which was very helpful. She was also always open to feedback and suggestions.
The location was perfect for our purposes, only a 10-minute walk to the convention center.
We would definitely book again!"
4410544,35780730,2015-06-22,24593954,Noeline,"Our trip to Seattle was way too short! Eve provided us with a lovely apartment, close to everything and within easy access to the freeway, which was great being a tourist. The apartment was exactly as it looked in all photos and we had everything we needed there"
4410544,36775571,2015-07-01,32009582,Glenn,"Great location. Had a great trip to Seattle with my family. Apartment was clean and we saved some time and money making breakfast there. WiFi was good, parking wasn't an expense because we used Uber for the first three days spent in town and street parking was free in the evenings for the last half of our trip when we would take our rental car for whole day visits to Rainier, St. Helens, the San Juan Islands and Boeing. Only a couple of minor cosmetic things that Eve earnestly sought to get fixed. "
4410544,37079380,2015-07-04,35497288,Dave,Unit was as advertised. We had a great stay! Eve was super responsive throughout (from pre-booking to checkout). 
4410544,37890799,2015-07-11,30163257,Tenesa,We were very happy with the apartment. It was clean and a great location. Eve was extremely responsive and even checked with us to see if we needed anything.

4410544,39938461,2015-07-27,34397149,Francesca,"The apartment and Eve were both wonderful. The place was very clean, fresh and comfortable, and there was even a stylishness and modernity about the place that was quite pleasing.  Items like higher-end towels and bedding made the experience feel luxurious without its seeming pretentious or stuffy.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat-- it was the perfect amount of space for our family, with a separate bedroom for my son, so my husband and I could hangout and relax in the living room and other bedroom after he'd gone to bed. Location was within a close Uber ride to everything, though totally walkable to good stuff, too, if you don't mind a twenty minute walk (which we didn't, given the lovely weather). "
4410544,40587527,2015-08-01,25770900,Michael,This was our second trip to Seattle and the second time that we stayed at one of Eve's property's. She does not disappoint. The apartment was conveniently located and well appointed. Eve is always responsive if you need anything. We will stay at one of Eve's apartments any time we are in Seattle. 
4410544,41737083,2015-08-09,30133760,Andrew,"We had a great time at the apartment. The check-in and check-out process was fast and convenient and completely stress free.

4410544,44709344,2015-08-28,38692856,Joey,"The place itself is nice and modern. But there are a lot of problem my family encounter stayed at the apartment. First, when we first came, the door is locked. So we have to wait for her to come and open the door. Second, the table in the living room is shaky and unstable. After we tell her about it, she said that she will send someone to fix it, but even after that, the table is still unfit for use. Third, the next night the internet is out, so we have to wait for her to come by and fix it the next day. Lastly, after we left, she request  $60 saying that my family broke the lamp in the apartment. When i replied the message asking which lamp is broken, she never replied. Now i have to involve airbnb to resolve this case. Really disappointed at this listing."

The apartment is really clean, spacious and well-decorated with more than everything one could get in a 5-star hotel. The host Jocelyn has been very helpful and responsive throughout the process. Definitely recommend!"
4388148,21928011,2014-10-26,12418887,Max,"Jordan was incredibly hospitable and a fantastic host. Getting the room was seamless and easy, and communication never once was an issue. If you are ever in Seattle, his home is a great headquarters to truly experience the city."
4388148,22410723,2014-11-05,22542238,Hannah,"We had a lovely experience at Jordan's studio! Jordan was helpful and very quick to respond to our last-minute questions about check-in/out, wifi, keys, etc. The apartment itself was simple and clean, very comfortable for two people. We loved being able to cook in the kitchen and watch Netflix. The location is super convenient, just a block from the #10 bus stop and a quaint street with cafes, grocery stores, and bars. "
4388148,22512070,2014-11-08,22580533,Pablo,We had an absolutely wonderful time! The space was clean and cozy! Definitely one of my favorite Airs! And the kitty was so gosh-darn adorable! Would definitely stay here again!  
4388148,22545805,2014-11-09,20942302,Joanna,"Our stay in Jordan's suite was great! The place was clean, bed was comfortable and location was awesome - street parking was a bit tricky but we eventually found a spot down the street. Applesauce was the sweetest kitty ever and made the experience even better.  "
4388148,22742736,2014-11-13,10638671,Risa,We had a great stay at Jordan's apartment! Jordan was quick to respond to questions we had and the apartment was lovely with many snuggles from the cutest cat ever. We really enjoyed staying here.
4388148,22846331,2014-11-16,22742128,Edgar,"Great neighborhood to stay in and the apartment is as advertised. Jordan went out of his to accommodate an earlier check-in time. Also, awesome cat! "
4388148,22988457,2014-11-19,477443,Sara,"Jordan was an incredible host. He made sure everything in the place was set up for us, offered up restaurant suggestions, and kept communication smooth and fluid. Great location and vibes. Cannot say enough nice things."
4388148,23089634,2014-11-22,5052217,Ashley,Cute apartment! Walking distance to bars and restaurants. Would stay here again.
4388148,23244342,2014-11-26,279445,Donald,"Jordan is a very flexible host. We had no problems coordinating. The apt. is as described: a studio with kitchen and bath. We had the pleasure of hosting the cat, also, who is super nice and friendly. He's easy and comes and goes. The location is amazing for breakfast and dinner: Olympia Pizza & Costal kitchen are fantastic. The Wander Goose for breakfast is amazing. Not to mention the cafes. Don't forget the Asian Art Museum and grave of Bruce Lee that is right around the corner. "
4388148,23638220,2014-12-07,4849876,Joshua,Had a great time in Seattle staying here. The cat is very chill and was no additional work. The place is also walking distance to a lot of great pubs. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Seattle:)
4388148,23766989,2014-12-09,4836261,Nicholas,"Great little place, convenient to one of the best parts of town. I recommend a walk through the greenhouse conservatory in Volunteer park. Comfy bed and adorable cat. I would stay again."
4388148,23869617,2014-12-13,9651642,Maira,"Good apartment in a great location!
The place was organized and clean. Really simple to get the keys.
The cat is adorable! Very lovely :) "
4388148,23994902,2014-12-16,12330399,Betsy,"We were welcomed with a bottle of wine. He checked up on us later that night to make sure we got settled OK.  The neighborhood was beautiful and we enjoyed walking around admiring the neighborhood's personality. The bus stop was near giving us easy transport to downtown. The ONLY downside was the construction sites next door. 
Applesauce was charming and cuddly. So friendly and made the place more homy. 
Great value for the location. Worked great for our purposes. "
4388148,24182646,2014-12-22,1485065,Mette,"Me and my boyfriend absolutely enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Jordan's appartment matched the description, and we had a great time there. It was really cozy to have Applesauce, Jordan's cat around :) The only negative thing was that there was a lot of noise from the heating element in the room and from the construction site outside the window. "
4388148,25259602,2015-01-10,4510649,Teresa,"Cute, clean place as shown in pics. Applesauce the cat was adorable and led us right to the correct apartment. Only two blocks to a street with many options for dining. Didn't hear any of the construction others mentioned, so maybe they don't work weekends or the project is done. Host responded quickly, with clear instructions. Would stay again."
4388148,25325628,2015-01-12,21463427,Marco,"Jordan's place was great. To start off with, Applesauce is one of the nicest cats I've ever met. Jordan's apartment was tidy and well decorated, and there was plenty of space for two or three people. The area is close to lots of restaurants and bars, and public transportation was easy to access. Jordan left us a bottle of wine, and was in touch quickly when contacted. Would definitely stay again."
4388148,25551623,2015-01-19,2226346,Kenneth,"Jordan apartment was perfect for my weekend getaway to Seattle! It has all the basics i needed for a comfortable stay. The cat was cute and friendly, no trouble at all.
However, what really stand out about his place is the location, ultra convenient to lots of shops, cafes, and restraurants, all were steps away. If i need to get down to lower capitol hill, and didn't feel like to walk, Uber is easy and inexpensive to use. This was my first time using Airbnb in over 2 years and was a great experience. Thanks Jordan!!"
4388148,26511744,2015-02-14,27560232,Manabu,"Jordan was very quick to respond and was very helpful with my forst experience with an airbnb stay.  The location was great with a walgreens less than a block away and also with lots of nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops close by.  There was a safeway a couple of blocks down and it was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Capitol Hill area where there are more bars, restaurants, etc.  

All in all it was a great, last minute 1 night stay and we were lucky to find this place in the area for such a great price."
4388148,26912437,2015-02-22,3056272,Phyllis,"We didn't meet Jordan during our 4-night stay, but everything was easily arranged and the key was exactly where he said it would be.  The cozy studio suited our needs and is conveniently located in a great neighborhood steps from cafes, restaurants, bars, markets, pharmacy, a great bakery, and public transportation.  There is a pretty view of the sunrise from the kitchen window.  Jordan's cat was very friendly and took care of itself."
4388148,27255348,2015-03-01,15267711,Marco,"We didn't meet Jordan however the apartment was exactly what we needed. Comfortable, clean and extremely cheerful place with lots of great natural lighting. The best part was the location - just blocks away from great restaurants and bars and made it extremely convenient.  Applesauce, the cat, was another charming addition to the apartment and even though he kept to himself mostly, it made the experience all the more fun. Highly recommended, would certainly stay here again."
4388148,27912515,2015-03-14,25446284,Megan,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4388148,28702506,2015-03-29,26062799,Angela,"The space, location, and host were amazing! Jordan was quick at getting back to me whenever I had a question and was very accomodating. It was our first time in Seattle and it turned out so well in part by being able to stay at Jordan's rental. The space was cozy and welcoming and very comfortable for two. The bed and couch and pillows are highly recommended as they allowed for a very comfortable stay. Applesauce was the perfect little housemate, she's so friendly and low maintenance. Everything was close by. We walked EVERYWHERE and when our feet complained there were bus stops conveniently located nearby. Good restaurants surrounded us; we had lovely breakfasts a couple of blocks away every morning before heading out to explore the city. I cannot recommend this place enough. Coastal Kitchen, Jamjuree, Harry's Bar and Olympia Pizza were a couple of favorites nearby."
4388148,29049300,2015-04-03,9677690,Jenny,Nice little spot outside of downtown. Walking distance to restaurants and bars. 
4388148,30387653,2015-04-21,15935007,NORMAN John,"The apartment was great for our needs, and well priced for what we got.  Note that there is a flight of stairs to climb.  Everything was prepared for our arrival.  Capitol Hill location is excellent; 15th Ave is just one block over, with abundant coffee shops, good restaurants, craft beer bars, etc.  It's in a small apartment building in a quiet and very attractive neighborhood.  Will very likely stay again."
4388148,31177171,2015-05-03,16793024,Jennifer,"We arrived a little early and Jordan welcomed us in with a nice chat about the local places.   Great neighborhood with lots of bars, coffee shops, grocery stores and major bus routes within a few blocks. The apartment was properly represented and we were even able to do some laundry in the coin op machines downstairs.  Jordan was quick with communication if we had any questions.  Applesauce the cat had important things to do outside but would pencil us in for some belly rubs, playtime and cuddling.  The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was easy to use. We would definitely stay again."
4388148,32916608,2015-05-23,32368569,Marisa,"Jordan was so accommodating! The apartment had all the basic hotel essentials - he even threw in some beverages and a train pass!! The apartment was near all the things we needed - amazing food, good shopping and uniques sites."
4388148,33215483,2015-05-25,25815785,Elizabeth,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4388148,33626101,2015-05-30,7174463,Stacy,"We had a great time at Jordan's place. Was located near many great restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store. Apartment was clean and was a comfortable space to live in for a few days. "
4388148,34117567,2015-06-05,23404298,Dwaine,Jordan's studio apartment is an older style but is functional and clean. Importantly there is WiFi and good TV; exactly what a tired traveler sometimes needs.
4388148,34362561,2015-06-07,34011623,Anna,Stayed at Jordan's place with my girlfriend for 2 nights. Excellent location - walking distance from great food+drink options. Place was pretty much as described/pictured. A little dusty but not too bad. It is a little difficult to find parking but not much to do about that but be patient. We didn't actually meet Jordan - but he was responsive to our texts and messages and we had no trouble. Overall a positive experience. 
4388148,35584449,2015-06-20,12671572,Diana,"It was very nice to stay at Jordan's apartment! The neighborhood was quiet and safe and convenient! There was a little construction noise, but it was fine since it only started after around 10am. The cat Applesauce was a very lovely cat! We enjoyed playing with her. We would always expect to see her at he front door when we came back home. She is definitely something special during the stay!"
4388148,35836367,2015-06-22,13958830,Jc,Jordan's place was exactly as described. We were so happy to have a cute kitty that would come and go as it pleased! It was very easy to find the location and super convenient to a lot of shops and restaurants. The parking is the only thing that was a little tough but that's what you get when ur in a city. I definitely recommend this place and we would stay again if we passed thru Seattle!
4388148,36419354,2015-06-28,13457085,Madalene,"Perfectly described and Jordan was kind enough to leave some refreshments in the fridge for me. Great communication and easy to work with the entire time. In addition, highly recommend for convenience and location."
4388148,36648729,2015-06-30,25423971,Mat & Manon,"Great place, very comfy bed, Chromecast is a big plus!
Applesauce is a sweety, always around for some love and belly rubs.
Bit of construction noise but nothing crazy. Also quite warm but when it's 30°c + outside that's just a given!
Overall great place, you won't be disappointed!"
4388148,37105905,2015-07-04,36828925,Hannah,"Jordan's place was outstanding! The apartment is located in a really fun neighborhood with numerous places to eat and drink within a block. The apartment was very clean, kitchen was stocked. Jordan made every attempt to make us feel welcome, from leaving the window fan on (during Seattle's record-breaking heat wave!) to stocking the fridge with bottled water! He was very good at communicating and it felt like we were staying with a friend instead of a stranger. The apartment was just a joy to stay in, impeccably decorated and the cat Applesauce was very friendly. The bed was comfortable, and the even though the shower was small the water pressure was on point. This was my first time using Airbnb and now I'm hooked!"
4388148,38438588,2015-07-15,7743973,Deana,"Jordan's apartment has a lot of charm and made my stay in Seattle enjoyable. It's within walking distance to so much - good restaurants, coffee shops, grocery store and bus line - all which I found very convenient. The addition of Applesauce was such a bonus too - very cool cat!"
4388148,38657667,2015-07-17,37926537,Tori,"Wonderful experience! The apartment was very clean and cozy. The bed was super comfy. It's located in a very safe area and the neighborhood was really cute. The owner's cat was there, and she's such a sweetie pie! Felt like I was home. Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."
4388148,39206982,2015-07-21,2623702,Cara,Jordan was very welcoming and accommodating! Apartment was cute and clean and bed was comfortable. Location was perfect -- very close to lots of shops and restaurants and a pretty easy walk to downtown. 
4388148,39851930,2015-07-26,38704742,Susan,"Jordan's little studio apartment made our short stay in Seattle spectacular! 
It was very nicely furnished and he had kindly stocked up everything for his guests. From the stocked fridge to all the toiletries in the bathroom, Jordan provided us with a great stay. 
His studio is located in Capitol Hill where safeway and local food stores are close and convenient. 
We couldnt be more happier with out stay! "
4388148,40375498,2015-07-30,9965326,Alexis,"What a great spot in a great location! If you are looking to be near the hub of Capitol Hill, this is the spot. Clean and airy, the apartment was perfect for two people. Jordan was so helpful and getting in and out was a breeze. Would definitely come back!"
4388148,40966046,2015-08-03,7682949,Kaitlin,"Had a great experience! Jordan was extremely accommodating. The apartment was nice and clean.  It is a great location, next to good restaurants and transportation.  "
4388148,41312513,2015-08-07,27854125,Alicia,Jordan was a great host! He was very helpful and communicative. The place is very nice and in a cool and safe neighborhood.
4388148,42010010,2015-08-10,29069094,Melissa,"Jordan was a fantastic host! The location was convenient to bars, restaurants and coffee shops on Capitol Hill. Jordan was attentive and quick to respond to all inquiries we had. I would definitely recommend staying at his place. "
4388148,43267664,2015-08-18,38789038,Edward,"Jordan's apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a perfect location to explore Seattle by foot. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Street parking in his neighborhood was fairly easy to find."
4388148,43819185,2015-08-22,20493553,Jennifer,"Capitol Hill was a perfect location for our first trip to Seattle. Our airbnb was near grocery stores, delicious restaurants, trendy bars, convenient public transportation, attractions and sites, and everything necessary to make for a successful trip. The listing was very comfortable and clean and the towels and bath amenities were a major plus for someone who had to pack light. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, so sleeping at night with windows slightly open was not an issue at all. Jordan was very accommodating and helpful! Would definitely stay again. Wish we got to meet Applesauce!"
4388148,44585686,2015-08-27,12471218,Liza,"Pros: Jordan's place had the ideal location right in the heart of Capitol Hill. With this prime location, the apartment is still very quiet and I had no trouble sleeping and relaxing there. I really appreciated how clean and tidy the place was when I arrived.  Pictures of the space are accurate. I will add: The bed is super comfy.

Host: Jordan was a responsive host and was thoughtful enough to leave me snacks and food for my stay. 

Cons: Like many Seattle apartments, this one has an old built-in carpet. Not much you can do about that; and this is very evident in the pictures. But: If you have allergies, take note."
4388148,44807277,2015-08-29,6986584,Caitlin,Comfortable place in a great neighborhood! Jordan was an excellent host and very communicative. Definitely recommend this place as a base to enjoy Capitol Hill. 
4388148,45122888,2015-08-31,12095593,Sam,We loved the location of Jordan's apartment. It was a great base to explore the Capitol Hill area of lovely Seattle. The bed was super comfy too!
4388148,46014290,2015-09-07,41662324,Nick,Never met Jordan but he was very friendly and accomodating. The place was everything I had expected from reading the review. Bus 10 picked up a short 3 min walk away and took us to the middle of downtown Seattle. There were also some great places to eat and a couple of grocery stores within very close walking distance. It was a great stay here!
4388148,47825106,2015-09-21,24638531,Angelo,"The place was easy to find and was exactly as listed. The fridge was stocked with water and breakfast foods, and all were offered to me which was great! Jordan always responded to questions instantly so communication was very good. The place was also one block away from a street full of restaurants, so plenty of food options close by. Would definitely stay again!"
4388148,48153729,2015-09-23,21842197,Janelle,"Great location and terrific host. Perfect place to walk to broadway, 15th, parks, and if you like long walks, downtown. Jordan was very accommodating and replied almost immediately to every question we had. Also left necessities in bathroom and kitchen. Highly recommend!"
4388148,48747050,2015-09-28,42505014,Aleesha,"Jordan was in the area when we arrived at his apartment so he was able to stop by and give us the keys personally. Jordan was very thoughtful - when we arrived he had a bottle of wine and 2 glasses out for us. He also left bottled water, orange juice, Greek yogurt, eggs, bacon, and English muffins in the refrigerator for us to eat for breakfast. Jordan was accessible throughout our stay; I had to contact him for help getting Netflix to work and he responded very quickly. It is a small space but this is advertised in the listing so I was not surprised. Overall, Jordan was a very accommodating host."
4388148,49957742,2015-10-07,36239609,Zak,"Great experience with Jason and this apartment.  Nice and clean little place, great location."
4388148,51189516,2015-10-18,1234964,Ira Mae,"Jordan was such a good host! He gave full description how to locate the key and everything and he also made sure that we had a good stay and even left food and wine in the refrigerator! Location was good, close to bars and restaurants, which I wanted and it wasn't far from downtown! But be aware, parking sucks at night but other than that, had a good stay at Jordan's place. When I go back to Seattle, I know where to stay again!"
4388148,51981472,2015-10-25,20908427,Nadya,Jordan certainly went above and beyond by leaving us a bottle of wine and a fully stocked fridge.  We loved the neighborhood and felt very at home!
4388148,52540434,2015-10-30,37926537,Tori,"Once again, I had a lovely stay at Jordan's. Clean, cozy, in a fantastic location, and I adore his cat, Applesauce! Will very likely stay here again. "
4388148,57169492,2015-12-22,20524167,Dan,"Where to begin.. Jordan's apartment is awesome. It is in a wonderful part of town and has every amenity you could want without feeling like a hotel. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud and the bathroom is large and luxurious, with white fluffy towels. We will absolutely be staying here in the future. His apartment made for the best anniversary getaway imaginable!"
4388148,58378385,2016-01-02,48104154,Katherine,"Jordan made our stay great - starting with leaving a bottle of wine! He was happy to offer his help in getting to know the area or give suggestions regarding anything in the city. The neighborhood was great and was walking distance to restaurants, bars and even a Walgreens. We loved our stay and Jordan was a great host!"
117165,452241,2011-08-16,858206,David,"This property is absolutely beautiful, newly~built house with full view of Puget Sound from living room and large deck. Judith is a real person, just beginning as a BNB host. The guest bedroom is in the back, own bathroom and also a separate desk area. Total quiet, which is not as easy as it sounds in Seattle. The only problem with staying here is that you won't want to leave the deck, so peaceful and inviting."
117165,467740,2011-08-22,974954,Matthew,"This experience was absolutely wonderful.  It was my first time in Seattle and I was visiting a friend, and low and behold I made another friend through this service.  
The home was absolutely stunning, and Judith was more than welcoming and friendly.  The part of Seattle that she lives in is gorgeous.  Reminded me a lot of San Francisco, except that you have a view of mountains beyond the sea!  The back porch rivaled my view that I have in Colorado.  Close to a great market, bike shop, Alki beach (which is just the greatest place in Seattle), and lots of shops, restaurants and bars.  
The home is a quiet place to relax after enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle.  Easy to ride a bike from her home, down Alki Beach and to downtown.  
I am certain this home made my trip as amazing as it was.  Without this home and the friendship gained with Judith, it would have just been another trip to another beautiful city. 
I will not stay anywhere but Judith's home when visiting Seattle!"
117165,479689,2011-08-27,959164,Julianne,"It as a pleasure to stay at Judith's lovely place. The view from the deck is amazing, I was there in summer so I was catching the water taxi into town, which was a real treat - (you have to get a shuttle to the wharf).  I'm not sure how frequently buses go if you're bussing it, the place is a walk and bus ride to shops so keep that in mind if you're not driving.

Judith is a delight - and helpful with information. I'd definitely go back there. "
117165,482104,2011-08-28,868700,Catron,"Judith is an amazing person and her place is equally stellar. The experience is one of a kind with a home this gives you a feeling of being both in the air and at the ocean. It's one of the most amazing travel stay experiences I've ever had. Quiet, spacious, private and with Judith you are graced by a host is who is both worldly and down to earth. Really incredible overall!"
117165,491237,2011-08-31,997608,Jessica,"Judith,

Thank you again so much for a wonderful weekend. My mom and I truly enjoyed staying with you in your beautiful home. Although we didn't get to spend much time together, I can tell you are a wonderfully spirited human being and I am glad to have met you. Sorry again for the surprise dog and working with us to make it comfortable for everyone. We really appreciated getting to spend more time together. 

Hope all is well,
Jessica"
117165,511578,2011-09-07,993940,Sana,The house is great.  Wonderful view from the deck.  Judith is extremely helpful in planning your stay in Seattle and surrounding areas.  She knows the area very well.  Judith also provided us with fresh towels and access to her kitchen and intriguing conversation.  I would recommend this stay to anyone.
117165,609864,2011-10-08,278220,Ellen,"Do yourself a favor: stay here! The home boasts an incredible view from the patio (on my next visit, I would probably just get a book and hang out on the patio all day!). The house itself is spacious and clean, and Judith was very open to us sharing all of the common space on the first floor (kitchen, dining, living room). The guest suite has a comfortable bed, a huge bathroom (both super clean). We didn't use the office space, but there's that too.

It really is good to have a car...we rented one for four days and didn't regret it. Plus, Judith will recommend the best places to visit in the nearby area and it is worthwhile to have a car.

The best part our our stay was Judith! We felt more like friends that strangers renting a room. Judith greeted us with hugs and refreshments, had coffee and muffins every morning for us, and throughout are visit we had opportunities to share conversation and get to know her. She is an incredible person and so interesting to talk to! She was also so kind in recommending us places to go or visit, and even loaned out her own personal gear since we came ill-prepared. If you stay here, don't miss out on getting to know her!"
117165,642853,2011-10-18,1134899,Dino,"Judith& her cat Kody are all very friendly and easygoing, also won't disturb u anytime. She is a graceful woman who can take good care of herself and the guests. The responsible and positive attitude to life can gives u a very wonderful feeling. Judith also have a good taste in art. You can feel it from her beautiful house which has a fantastic waterscap vision. I will miss u,Judith&Kody(^.^)
This is my first time using airbnb, fortunately it was so amazing and cool!!
The house was just looks like the pictures shown in Internet.  I hope I can have more chance to feel the home-like feeling with airbnb & remarkable host:)"
117165,652878,2011-10-22,1238047,John,Judith was a great host. She worked most of the time and we chatted in the morning over coffee. The views from here deck were spectacular. One afternoon  I decided to work from the deck and watch the sunset. 
117165,671506,2011-10-28,1289958,Ivan,"
Judith is an amazing host and very friendly person. Her house is quite and gorgeous, with specious living room and incredible view over Puget Sound.  She provide us with access to the kitchen, coffee and muffins every morning.  We've had conversations and  get to know each other.
  The house is a short walk to the public transportation  - water taxi shuttle or city bus, couple minutes down to Alki beach and surrounding restaurants.  
 
Definitely  recommend this stay to everyone.
 
We'll miss you Judith and Kody! 
"
117165,692385,2011-11-04,1351017,Sas,"Awesome views and a wonderful host. I would stay here anytime I'm in Seattle. It was our first time ever to use such form of accomodation. Now that I've discovered this other great and more affordable way to stay in Seattle, I would not wish to stay in any hotel ever again if this place is available.
Locationwise it's convenient to the best spots in Seattle.
Judith generously offered us her living room and I used her dining table everyday to do some work away from home.
Thank You for a wonderful stay.
"
117165,706506,2011-11-09,1351017,Sas,"We stayed twice at Judith's place and loved it. She is the best host that anyone could have. She gave us lots of space to use and was always available to answer any questions that we had.
I would'n t want to stay anywhere else if i'm in the area.
Her place is home away from home.
"
117165,711964,2011-11-12,1335659,Deana,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was pretty nervous about staying with a stranger. Judith was warm and welcoming--her house is fantastic (the view is phenomenal)--and the stay couldn't have been nicer. Comfy bed, clean and roomy accommodations and I came and went as needed for work, though it felt like a retreat getaway. I'm hoping to stay at Judith's place every time I come to Seattle!"
117165,723428,2011-11-15,1256486,Karl,"I looked forward to meeting Judith as she was a highly recommended host. I appreciated her kind consideration and willingness to book me on such short notice. Immediately evident was that her home was beautifully built and kept. She provides first rate accommodations with private bathroom and office off master bedroom. Arcadian architecture features spacious living area with stone fireplace, hardwood floors, and wood planked cathedral ceiling with rustic rafters and great gabled wall of windows welcoming picturesque waterscape of Puget Sound. Enjoy majestic mountain views and spectacular sunsets from the comfort and convenience of this home, whether inside or out on the deck. It's a short distance to town where shops, eateries, and restaurants are along Alki Beach waterfront that boasts the most beautiful panoramic view of downtown Seattle day or night. Sublime seascape meets lofty landscape stretched by spectacular city skycrapers hugging the  horizon. Bring your camera! Pictures are worth a thousand words but the experience of being here says it all. This is one of those places you'll want to write home about and visit again... "
117165,734660,2011-11-21,1359544,Kevin,"First experience with Air BnB and what a great way to start! Terrific home,and wonderful host. I would definitely do it all over again. Thank you Judith."
117165,746994,2011-11-27,186102,Tara,"Judith's house has the most unique architecture of any home I have been in.  The interior is very well maintained and spacious. For the chance to be somewhere quiet yet still a fairly brief drive to the airport or downtown you couldn't find a better place. If you enjoy going for a walk on the beach it is accessible by walking about 8 blocks. For those who want to ""shop locally"" there are many shops at the Alaska Junction (2 miles away, car recommended) . There is also a well furnished kitchen which is great if you want to fix some breakfast in the morning or, as a tourist, fix a bite to eat at the end of a long day. "
117165,805362,2011-12-25,1445473,Vladimir,"Everything about Judith's place is amazing, she's the kind of host I hope to find at airbnb. The home was well maintain and clean with wonderful views easy access to food and entertainment. Judith made sure that I had everything I needed including special dinners with friends. Also, I had to say that Kodiak the cat(my new friend) is a wonderful pet. My visit and first experience with airbnb and Seattle were wonderful. "
117165,866845,2012-01-16,707453,Penny,"Everything about my experience in Judith's home was top-notch.  The house itself was clean, well-maintained, and comfortable.  The house itself is beautiful and the view was incredible, as expected.  Communication with Judith was easy and companionable.  I hope to stay here again soon!"
117165,898540,2012-02-02,316021,Rodica,"Judith is a most graceful & warm host - very open, extremely easy to talk to, and very welcoming to her guests. 

The house itself is even more beautiful and cozier than the pictures, if that's possible! I've had a lovely time and I can't wait to return in the near future. "
117165,903187,2012-02-05,862358,Deborah,I was fortunate to stumble on this listing. Judith's place is beautiful and cozy with a comfortable en suite/office arrangement. The unusual warm(ish) sunny day in Seattle that allowed me to enjoy sitting on the deck in February added to making this a wonderful experience.  
117165,923585,2012-02-15,1678217,Rick,"Judith's home is wonderful! It is just as beautiful as advertised, and Judith's graciousness and her warm welcome were terrific. I couldn't recommend this location any more highly!"
117165,935295,2012-02-20,348996,Mustafa,We had an awesome stay with Judith and an even better Sunday morning breakfast/brunch in her lovely home. Me and my fiance Heidi stayed in Judith's home on the Presidents Day long weekend for my first ever trip to Seattle (from Vancouver). We were held up at the border and were about 4-5 hours late to our ETA at Judith's home but she was still waiting for us. The  home is beautiful and our was very cosy and clean. We also had a lovely companion in Kodiak (the ragdoll cat). The views from the home are fabulous. I would recommend Judith and her home to anyone looking for a quiet and indulgent place.
117165,1015727,2012-03-18,1022206,Tamer,"Gorgeous place - it's crazy to think the house is only 20 mins or so from downtown! The view overlooking the water is worth it alone, but Judith is a super accommodating host, and great for a chat on a rainy day!"
117165,1081789,2012-04-04,1681762,Rollin,We were looking for a quiet place to celebrate our anniversary and the views and the home certainly lent themselves to a great celebration. 
117165,1129149,2012-04-14,2053919,Karen,"A wonderful place to stay, with views over the mountains and sea and beach walks nearby. We saw seals playing in the bay and sunset over the water. There are good local restaurants and the city is just a 10 minute boat ride away. Perfect for anyone who wants both the city and the outdoors."
117165,1236611,2012-05-06,2032996,David S.,Judith was a pleasant and competent hostess. The place was exactly as described. The view was truly awe inspiring. The suite in back was private and accommodating. No complaints whatsoever. A delightful stay.
117165,1466346,2012-06-12,2204529,Kara,Judith's home is absolutely breathtaking. She was a very pleasant housemate to live with. I would recommend this accommodation to anyone who is looking for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Kody the cat is a cutie pie as well and has been fun to live with!
117165,1484173,2012-06-15,1738865,Anne-Grete,"I had never believed it possible to arrive to an ""old friend"" instead of a regular host! But that is the way it was. Complete match host, guest and house with surroundings. Welcome to Norway Judith! "
117165,1514827,2012-06-19,2173041,Tim,"I have never stayed in a home and rather stay in hotels so I was a bit nervous about how everything works.  Judith did an amazing job at answering and communicating things along the way prior to my trip so that when I was on my trip I could sit back, relax, and just enjoy life. And that's just what I did.

Judith was a very gracious host and her home was truly a mark of beauty on the West Seattle hillside.  I could have sat and starred out off the deck at the lovely view for days on end.  It is truly breathtaking and a sight to see!  The house was everything and more than I get out of a hotel stay so in my opinion I am glad I came across this place!  Everything was placed neatly to accommodate anything a  traveler/visitor could want.  A nice breakfast bar, table, reading nooks, and the front deck of course!  All very quaint!  I love how this house was put together!  Very decorative and the pictures don't lie, only seeing it in person IS much, much better!  Thank you for your courtesy Judith!  I will be back after I leave my mark in other cities around the world!  THANK YOU!"
117165,1554400,2012-06-25,485759,Ann,"Judith is a very special woman who, very luckily for us, is sharing her very special home.  The house looks exactly like what you see in the photos and the views are incredible.  Alki Beach is wonderful and a very nice change of pace from downtown Seattle.

Judith - thank you! My husbanh and I felt truly welcomed by you.  We hope to visit you again.

"
117165,1744435,2012-07-19,536521,Eline,"Traveller, were you drawn in by the pretty pictures? So we're we, and in reality, the house and the views are even better. But what makes us want to go back is Judith. She is an amazing host, super friendly, knowledgable and very funny. If you have the chance, go here!"
117165,1836431,2012-07-30,480018,Kate,"Judith was a very friendly, generous, and accommodating host. She has a beautiful place with an absolutely fantastic view :) Thanks to her for a great stay! "
117165,2048777,2012-08-20,2810947,Linda,"This was a great place to stay, beautiful view, and a very welcoming hostess.  We were in the area for a family wedding, Judith was very gracious, allowing my son and stay in the afternoon between the wedding and the reception.  My Mom spent the night, and enjoyed the whole experience.  I would not hesitate to suggest this location to friends and family, and would love to stay there myself sometime.  "
117165,2140632,2012-08-30,2257482,Leonard,"A stay in the house of Judith Cederblom is like a stay with your favorite cousin.  She is warm, friendly, intelligent and funny.  Her house is immaculate and beautifully located overlooking Puget Sound.  We took breakfast on the deck, as well as wine and cheese, watching various boats passing by..  Our room  had a comfortable bed and chair and a spacious private bath.  We spent several evenings together, sharing stories and conversations in her living room, overlooking her large stone fireplace.  When you visit with Judith, you are visiting with your new best friend."
117165,2207112,2012-09-05,3074740,Kenneth,"Judith's home is a treasure. Looking out from her deck is one of the most beautiful views I have ever enjoyed. She is a charming hostess who made us feel like close friends, while allowing us all the privacy we wanted."
117165,2301259,2012-09-17,1198413,Mike,"Judith says she can be cantankerous. I'm not so sure. We found oursleves drawn closely to judith, loved the room, the house, the views and the area. It really was quite a problem realising that we had to go back to England after our final couple of days with Judith. Our final dinner in USA was on Judith's balcony overlooking Puget Sound as the sun came down.
Thanks Judith"
117165,2456679,2012-09-30,838778,Ann,"WOW!  What a wonderful and beautiful home!  The view, the location, the view, the host, the view, the deck...  did I mention the view?!  :-)   We had such a great time at Judith's home for 3 days; so relaxing.  Alki beach area in west Seattle was great.   The area felt like you were in a lil' island community.  You are out of the city, but only a quick water taxi ride or car ride away.  Next time we are in the area we will definitely stay with Judith!!   "
117165,2665883,2012-10-20,291971,Maïté,"I was about to arrive to Seattle.
I wanted a nice place with Wifi and an ocean's view.
And I shared much more !
Judith was nice, very helpful before my arrival. I had some last moment issues but she was very accommodating. She invited me to go to a very interesting event with her, she helped me for grocery shopping,... And we had very pleasant moments together. We had long talks and funny times. I really enjoyed staying with her. Judith was part of my great meetings of my trip.
Plus, she has many leaflets or other helpful documents to make your way to Seattle.
 "
117165,2871478,2012-11-12,880598,Brandon,"Judith is an absolute doll!  She has a wonderfully beautiful home overlooking the Sound from above the Alki Beach area.  She is an easy drive to the shops and restaurants on California and we found staying here absolutely magical.

The room and attached bath are on the main floor, everything was very clean and comfortable.  Judith also has a great selection of tea to accompany the coffee.

I would highly recommend her home for a great place to get away and relax!"
117165,3442979,2013-01-30,4584691,Luke,"A very nice house, we loved the view!  Judith is a very nice person, a pleasure to stay at her home.

Thank you for having us over :)"
117165,3526772,2013-02-12,4654205,Natalie,"While planning a trip to Seattle,  my daughter suggested I try airbnb to select a place to stay.  I chose Judith's lovely home based on the location and the reviews.  It was perfect.  She is a wonderful hostess and went out of her way to make me feel welcome in her home.  She has a wealth of knowledge about the area and a wide variety of activities.  Sipping coffee in the morning with her and taking in the view from her deck is a perfect way to start the day.  "
117165,4842841,2013-05-28,880598,Brandon,"This was our second time staying with Judith.  In fact, there was another place on AirBnB closer to where we needed to be, but the chance to see and catch up with Judith again was not worth passing up!  Judith is a wonderful host, an amazing woman, and I can not say enough good things about her, her hospitality, and just the warm feeling you get by being welcomed in to her home.

Everything is clean, comfortable, convenient, and the views of the sound in the morning (especially on sunny days) just make you feel happy all over!  Don;t hesitate - book now!"
117165,4929745,2013-06-02,1928841,Megan,"Judith's home is beautiful, peaceful, and so very relaxing - exactly as it appears in the pictures but even better because you can feel the breeze from the water, hear the birds, and enjoy the views from the huge glass windows (or even better, from the deck when the weather cooperates).  Judith is a delightful host who knows how to strike the perfect balance between interacting and allowing for privacy.  I stayed with her the week before I was moving and was very busy with work and details, and only wish I had more time to connect with her, but appreciated her allowing me the space I needed to focus on tasks while also relaxing.  I didn't feel like I was intruding on someone else's space, and I also didn't feel like she was having to change her routine - really, a perfect balance.  Highly recommend Judith's beautiful home to anyone looking for a location outside of the city to relax and recharge.  "
117165,5106919,2013-06-12,5657524,Shannon And Jeff,Judith's house is beautiful and in an awesome location.  My husband and I had the best time there and even shared drinks and stories with Judith and some friends of hers.  We felt so welcome and at home there.  I will definitely stop by again if I am in the area.
117165,5360986,2013-06-26,5523584,Ed,Judith is a sweetheart.  Very easy to work with and condiderate.  The house has spectacular views and it is a very comfortable and clean place to stay.  Location is a convenient walk to Alki Beach.
117165,5496223,2013-07-02,6847567,Jimmi,"This place has one of the best views! Beautiful deck over the water, mountains with snow cap mountains, 15-20 minute walk to the beach! The house was very architecturally unique, beautifully decorated, and the rooms were very clean. Judith was very welcoming and treated us like a true guest.

The profile for this place is very accurate. Since my girlfriend is Turkish and Judith speaks turkish, they hit it off really well, and the whole trip was superb. Also, it was sunny and warm almost every day we were there. Maybe Judith did that as well?

Very relaxed environment both with Judith and when she is not there. A great home away from home if you do go to Seattle.

Cok misafirperver bir ev sahibi ve cok guzel bir ev. Tesekkurler Judith!"
117165,5662112,2013-07-10,6817143,Robert,"This was our first airbnb experience and what a fantastic discovery Judith and her lovely home were for us.  The pictures are incredible, but in actuality the setting is even more beautiful than captured on the pics.  Judith’s home is neat, clean and inviting with shared space for visiting and private space for resting.   What could be better than starting one’s day with coffee on the deck and finishing the day with a beautiful pastel sunset?  Judith was a wonderful host and her home is a retreat/respite for any traveler.    Thank you, Judith -- for making us feel welcome, relaxed and content.    You are truly special!  (Bob and Mary)"
117165,5798262,2013-07-16,4653382,Caroline,Judy was an amazing host and her place sure is beautiful. I especially liked hanging out on the deck in the mornings and late afternoons. She had some good recommendations for my stay here and even drove me to the bus stop when I left!
117165,5894415,2013-07-21,340411,Clinton,"We had a fantastic time with Judith - she's smart, well read, full of energy and has a wicked sense of humour!  We ended up staying up well into the early morning, putting the world to rights.  The house itself is beautiful, with a deck looking out over the Puget Sound.  Very sad to leave as it felt like we were parting with a friend. See you in Barcelona, Judith!"
117165,5968677,2013-07-24,7036657,Thomas,"I almost hate to share because I want to keep this spot for myself. Judith is truly a beautiful person, her house is wonderful and the view of Puget Sound extraordinary. We would still be sitting on her deck looking over the Sound if it had been possible. I'm not sure what was more lovely, Judith's personality or the view from her home, both were fabulous. The next time we need to recharge our life batteries we're going to Judith's."
117165,6077547,2013-07-29,7074546,Peter,"Fantastic location and fantastic view.
Highly recommend this suite + office and the owner is very helpful and accommodating."
117165,6159903,2013-08-01,5048060,Wendy,A great place to stay when visiting Seattle. Judith is a wonderful host. Helpful and accommodating and the house is gorgeous. The view is stunning. 
117165,6946878,2013-08-31,8294660,Penny,"Judith is delightful, welcoming, her home is so beautiful and the view is to die for!  The location is perfect for a lovely brunch and mid-day walk at Alki beach and an easy drive to downtown Seattle.  We highly recommend Judith's lovely home...we look forward to visiting again soon! "
117165,7016293,2013-09-03,7775157,Michael,"Judtih was a fantastic host, and her home was even more amazing than the pictures online lead you to believe. 

She was very accommodating and extremely helpful in guiding us to our journey around the city. She knows all the cool spots, sights to see and events going on.

When we go back to Seattle, we are going to see if Judith is available first, and plan our trip around her vacancies! That's how much we would want to stay with her again. 

If you get a chance to stay here and interact with Judith, don't miss it.  "
117165,7331779,2013-09-16,3039188,Chong,"My favorite thing about the house was the view, and what a view it has! absolutely gorgeous! Judith's house is very sweet and cute as well as full of light. The entire house is completely soaked with the most beautiful sunset in the evening, if you are lucky with the weather. Judith is a very engaging person and we had a lot of fun talking about a lot of things over wine and meals together. The area is very quiet and remote so you need a car to get around, but I would definitely stay here again instead of the busy downtown area. "
117165,7424537,2013-09-19,4802670,Ann,"Quiet,serene place.The view is beautifull! Bedroom is clean, comfy."
117165,7491539,2013-09-22,8599656,Jason,"We had a great experience at Judith's place.  Both my wife & I agreed that staying with Judith contributed significantly to our enjoyment of our time in Seattle.  She was a warm, welcoming and humorous host.  Great bedroom & bathroom.  And the postcard-perfect views from her home were beyond expectations!  Hope we have the opportunity to visit again..."
117165,7778977,2013-10-02,3173798,Paolo,"A really gorgeous house, a superb view and a perfect host!
Could you ask something more?
This is perfect if you stay in Seattle, a corner of peace, silence, culture and light.
Judith is a special person, she will share with you not only the house, but also her culture, humor and tips.
We really had a very pleasant time there, and Judith’s home has been determinant.
"
117165,8121962,2013-10-16,4998294,Ania & Joe,"I couldn't have asked for any better first time American experience. Judith was ever so generous at all levels. She introduced me to best people, best places and best events  of Seattle. I gained friend for life besides high quality days in her magnificent home. 
"
117165,10572345,2014-02-25,1142709,Maureen,"Staying at Judith's was the highlight of our winter travels.

The atmosphere breathes rest and comfort, and the many chambers seem full of welcomes.

117165,13281234,2014-05-24,14697375,Lynn,"We couldn't have asked for a better host (quote from my husband, ""She couldn't have been better."")  You'll realize you've chosen the right place when you see the breathtaking Puget Sound view and then meet your host, Judith.  She truly cares that you have a nice stay, but even more, she is wonderful to get to know.  She had everything we needed for a comfortable, cozy stay in her beautiful home.  A 10 minute ferry from beautiful Alki Beach in her neighborhood is a fun and easy way to go to downtown Seattle.  And we loved just being in Alki Beach.  We will be back to stay in Judith's house in West Seattle.  It was perfect!"
117165,14556622,2014-06-22,14413558,Paul,"Perched on a hill with panoramic views of Puget Sound, this really is a Room With A View. The house is fabulous and the deck is the perfect spot for breakfast while watching ships go sailing by. It's also a tranquil location; a great place to think big thoughts without disturbance or outside intrusion. Judith's a wonderful host with a wealth of good books and music that you're welcome to share, With a little encouragement, she might even recite some Shakespearean sonnets or Persian poetry for you. "
117165,15405194,2014-07-08,15940166,Hugh,"A beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood with a stunning view!  Many thanks to Judith, our hostess, for making our first airbnb stay such a wonderful experience.  She made us feel at ease and at home during our four-night stay.  Judith is also a pleasure to spend time with and to get to know.

The room is very private, quiet, and comfortable.  There is a large private bath directly attached to the room, and there is also an adjacent work space.  My partner and I were surprised to find that we slept better in this room than we do in our own home!

Close by is a very good and very popular Italian restaurant -- an easy 7-minute (or so) walk down the hill towards the waterfront.  The main Alki strip is about a 20-minute walk away.  While we had a car, we often walked to the restaurants at Alki Beach because we enjoy the exercise when we are on vacation.  The Alki Beach / West Seattle neighborhood is a little gem that is often overlooked by visitors. It has many interesting shops and good restaurants that will not disappoint."
117165,15859447,2014-07-17,7412891,Nick,"What a beautiful home and beautiful person.Everything is exactly as it appears in the picture, however cannot capture just how beautiful it really is.  Judith waited up to make sure we got settled after long flight delays.  The room was comfortable and sparkling clean.  Judith is an amazing host and so very thoughtful.  She is one of those people you cross paths with and feel like she is an old friend.  She has an amazing feel for knowing what you need and when you need it.  We truly loved staying here.  The view, the home and the host will remain with us!  "
117165,16077141,2014-07-22,1309991,Urs,Our stay in Judith's home was the best beginning of our west coast trip we could imagine. We had inspiring discussions having breakfast on the terasse deck of her house with this amazing view over pudget sound. She helped us in any kind (restaurant tips etc.) and was the perfect host. We would come back at any time.
117165,16540450,2014-07-29,3735256,Deborah,"Judith was a wonderful host. She welcomed us on arrival, and made certain that we had everything we needed. Her home is lovely, peaceful, and quiet. The view of the Puget Sound is unbeatable, and we spent most of our time sitting on the deck looking out over the water and the Olympic range. The neighborhood is high on a hill, but it's an easy walk to Alki. We loved it!"
117165,17752900,2014-08-17,16020074,Jill,"More amazing then the picture...The home and views are beautiful!..Thank you Judith for thinking of all the important details...we had a restful, fun holiday...Location is great to get to beach, downtown all that the Seattle area offers! "
117165,18259431,2014-08-24,18949248,Mary Jo,"We can't imagine staying at a more ideal place in Seattle than Judith's beautiful home. This was our first experience staying at a personal residence instead of a hotel, and we're so glad we made that choice. Located a few (hilly) blocks from Alki Beach, this wonderful house surrounded us with beauty, comfort, and peace while still allowing us to easily access downtown Seattle via water taxi, bus, or car. The accommodations are lovely, and from the deck, we enjoyed world-class sunsets and fantastic views of Puget Sound and the mountains. Judith is the perfect hostess. She made us feel very much at home, offering information and suggesting resources while allowing us to come and go at will. Judith is a treasure, and we look forward to staying at her home again."
117165,18505917,2014-08-27,20290109,Kay,"Gracious and welcoming host.
Lovely private room and bathroom.
Spectacular view!
Hope to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle!"
117165,18979255,2014-09-04,12295742,Rodrigo,"The home is beautiful, the view is fantastic, the location couldn't be better and Judith is absolutely fantastic. What a marvelous host! She helped us plan our days in and around Seattle and Mt Rainier and her knowledge was invaluable. My girlfriend and I had the time of our lives staying at Judith's! Already looking forward to coming back some day! "
117165,19278986,2014-09-09,19705705,Katja,"We really loved our stay in Seattle with Judith. The setting was wonderful and Judith's home was so lovely and cozy. We loved all the facilities and wished that we had a rainy day so that we could cuddle up on the sofa directly in front of the large window front to enjoy the beautiful view over the English Bay. Instead of that we got three very sunny days which we use to explore the city. And Seattle is awesome! Thanks so much to Judith for sharing her home with us. All the interesting talks and the time we spent together made our stay in Seattle so much more memorable. We will definitely come back!!! Thanks, Judith! Andreas & Katja, Germany"
117165,19631051,2014-09-15,14438802,Steve And Kathy,What a wonderful time we had with Judith! A beautiful comfortable home along with an even more precious lady. We'll be back! 
117165,19889104,2014-09-20,20492550,Trish,"Spectacular experience. Lovely host , comfortable home, extraordinary view. "
117165,20357251,2014-09-28,8461829,Morris,"If other hosts are as gracious and as interesting; if other airbnb homes are as comfortable and as beautiful; who could want to stay in a hotel? Judith is one of a kind, managing to carry on her own life and still care for and care about her guests. We experienced the best of two possibilities: we came and went as if it were our own place, and at the same time, we met a new friend."
117165,20568567,2014-10-01,19069239,Jia,"Judith's home is beautiful and  the view is fantastic,How confortable that I stay here.I have a good time staying at seattle,thanks Judith. I'll come here again ..miss you !"
117165,21224224,2014-10-13,21340572,Hee Kyung,She was so nice. We were so  happy while staying there. Suite was awesome. I have a plan to stay there with my whole family in near future. Love it!!
117165,21984392,2014-10-27,22298884,Martha,"We arrived at the house and Judith was there to welcome us and get us settled.  She is warm and friendly.  The house itself is gorgeous, as described.  Everything you require is there ready for you.  The views from the deck really are beyond description.  Whether it is a sunny or stormy day, the views of the Puget Sound are mesmerizing.  "
117165,23495610,2014-12-02,9895636,Yuriy,"I was moving to Seattle from across the country, and spent my first month at Judith's house. I could not have asked for a better place and better first impression of Seattle!

The place is absolutely amazing - unbeatable views of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains, extremely well designed and decorated, in a beautiful, quiet, peaceful neighborhood. 

Judith was a wonderful host and great person to get to know - I really enjoyed her company during my stay. We had many great conversations, and I learned a lot from her. Kiri, the cat, was great company as well - even if she can be a bit of a brat at times! There's also the neighbor, Gary, who was very nice and helpful as well. 

The location is wonderful is you want something peaceful and beautiful. It doesn't feel like being in the city at all, and yet it's just a 20-something minute drive to downtown DURING RUSH HOUR(d readily recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle!"
117165,24527040,2014-12-30,11156199,Lee,"What a fantastic home! The views from the living room and deck are amazing, looking over Puget sound and the snow capped Olympic mountains.  We actually saw a pod of Orca whales swimming and breaching in the sound! Judith's home is clean, in a safe convenient area,comfortable and very quiet. Judith is so welcoming and full of great knowledge about the surrounding area and offered some wonderful ideas about day trips, wine bars, and ferry rides to the islands.  There was a hot pot of coffee waiting for me each morning and I enjoyed chit chatting with Judith. She is so welcoming and made her home such a comfy place for me. I now have a new friend in Seattle and plan on staying with her again when I visit  my daughter who recently moved to Seattle.  "
117165,25333354,2015-01-12,19136687,Jeff,Very nice house. Judith was a very gracious host and was very sweet us. the view is amazing and we enjoyed the fires at night watching the city lights Thanks
117165,25687120,2015-01-23,5765158,Roza,"I loved Judith's home. Very bright, excellent view and comfortable bed. I have never seen such a peaceful cat Judith has, a white ragdoll. We went for a stroll together :) The house was clean, very warm (underfloor heating and 2 fireplaces) and pictures are very accurate.  And above all, Judith is an excellent host!"
117165,25899589,2015-01-29,16359790,Yang,Judith是位超级nice的主人，我和女儿在她漂亮的家渡过难忘的四天，她与女儿在灯下联弹琴的画面将定格在我的记忆中……
117165,29880445,2015-04-13,29406571,Kelsie,"My husband and I stayed in Judith's home (which far surpasses the photos seen in this listing) over a weekend while I had training in Seattle. We had a changing, inflexible schedule and Judith was very accommodating. It's about a 12 minute drive (scenic and beautiful the whole way) from downtown Seattle and has absolutely beautiful views of the Olympics, the Sound, and occasionally, huge bald eagles who nest nearby. Judith has a very comfortable home (the bed was so cozy and wonderful, the bathroom was spotless and private) with many eclectic decorations and souvenirs from her life's travels-as well as a profound gift for hosting and making her guests feel welcome. Her rag doll cat, Kiri was also a pleasure to be around (my husband didn't think he liked cats until he was around Kiri). Judith's home is within walking distance from Alki beach and several restaurants and shops, and she is a pleasure to get to know. We didn't want to leave! I am sure we will be back! "
117165,30045245,2015-04-16,25659597,Otto,"Judith's house is an incredible structure situated in an amazing (though also slightly out of the way) location. It sits at the top of the hill and overlooks towards the Puget Sound with 3 and half stories worth of giant windows. The porch is big and comfortable and the house itself is spacious. Judith was a fantastic host and I had a great time just talking with her. She was accommodating and my room was kept to high standards. She was also very helpful with anything I wanted to know about Washington.

Kiri, her cat is also very sweet and amusing. I walked to Alki beach a couple of times and the nearest bus stop is about a 10 minute walk. If you're thinking about going anywhere besides Alki beach, I would recommend renting a car."
117165,30609716,2015-04-25,2373743,Einat,"I stayed at Judith's with my husband on our 1st year anniversary during our adventurous trip to gorgeous Seattle and Washington. I have never felt more welcome or more connected to a place as I did on that one heavenly week, hovering above the color painted waters of Puget Sound in our own private suite in the trees. We had the great pleasure and honor to come to know Judith, an exciting, energetic, insightful personality with many stories to share. As an unexpected benefit, we both felt for that brief but memorable time with her as a part of the family, spending quality time enjoying the company of her plush kitty, her neighbors and friends, be it the frequenting fowl on the front deck or the kind and open-minded conversational humans.
Staying at this utopia of a home, carefully and sensitively designed with details of personal history and a natural taste for comfort and spiritual wholeness – made our time go by with a peaceful smile and many good random fortunes gravitating our way with every new day. 
As far as the neighborhood is concerned – we took it all in by landing nearby in the ferry and exploring hilly West Seattle with our rental car. We indulged on scrumptious local eats and dinners we've prepared ourselves in Judith's splendidly equipped kitchen.  We had everything we needed at our disposal and savored the magnificent sunsets, the greens and blues and spring flowers that surrounded us.      
This was far more than just a place to crash; this was a comforting, soulful, beautiful place to call home for a while – and someone new to call a friend. 
I look forward to being back there when our lives allow us to venture far and long once more, this time hopefully with our baby girl which we are anticipating to meet this July.
Thank you Judith for everything and be sound,
               Einat & Niv

117165,30953170,2015-04-29,30967488,Lu,"Judith is a very nice, friendly hostess. She loves her life, enjoys friends and traveling, makes her house so warm and beautiful. The long and great talk between us that evening will always in my memory. Judith is so smart and we learned a lot from her. I like sitting in the dining room or standing on the deck watching sunset over the mountains. It's great. Kiri ,the cat , so cute, ""escape artist"",made a funny story when we lived there. The house located by the side of Alki beach and takes about 20minutes drive to downtown Seattle . Worth to try!"
117165,31371617,2015-05-04,28694467,Xiaochen,"We had really great experience when we lived there. The view was amazing and Judith is pretty nice and kind. She always help us if we have any questions. By the way, thank you for nice tea. We will come back and recommend here to our friends. Thanks!"
117165,31999122,2015-05-12,14169249,Olivia,"Regarding the house: It is exactly what the picture shows!! The bedroom is neat and clean, and you can find a lot of beautiful artworks. The living room with the astonishingly beautiful view is our favorite. We like the window, Kiri (a cute cat), the plant judith have been working on ... well, we like almost everything. 

Regarding the host: Judith is a very kind lady, who picked up us at the train station and always glad to have a conversation. I wish we could have more time to talk with her, but we have a tight schedule in Seattle. 

I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends, and come back again next time visiting Seattle."
117165,32595040,2015-05-19,1249534,Dharani,"VOW ! The house with the best view in Seattle and yet close to all activities.
We really enjoyed the company of host Judith. She was kind enough to share books and ideas for our day trips in Seattle and introduce us to her neighbor to learn more about hiking trails.

It was never easy to leave Seattle after the stay :) "
117165,33071673,2015-05-25,27266752,Sebastian,"Pasamos tres noches con mi esposa en esta hermosa casa. La vista es indescriptiblemente bella y la tranquilidad del lugar hace que incluso sea difícil querer salir de allí.
Judith es amable en todo momento y está atenta a cualquier duda que tengas o ayuda que puedas necesitar.
La gatita Kiri es hermosa, fue definitivamente un extra inesperado de nuestra estadía allí.
En resumen: casa, vista, tranquilidad y anfitrión se llevan el más alto puntaje posible. "
117165,33601453,2015-05-30,23449286,Anita,"Judith is a wonderful hostess.  Her house is gorgeous.  Very comfortable and the view is outstanding. We had a lovely time staying at her home.  Lots of fun together.  If we come back to Seattle, we will definitely try to stay with her again. :)"
117165,34416268,2015-06-08,26603561,Deb,"Judith was warm and welcoming and her beautiful home is as it appears in description and pictures.  Fantastic location, close to Alki Beach, short drive to downtown Seattle and views that simply take your breadth away.  The bedroom, bath and office area was perfect for our needs. Only regret not making more use of the beautiful space!   Thanks so much for the beautiful memories Judith! Until we meet again!"
117165,34647068,2015-06-10,28617514,Jessica,The house is so gorgeous!Everything here just like what u see in the pic.Judith and her house give me a beautiful memory in Seattle!Judith is really nice and helpful.I keep on troubling her these days but she has so much patience.I hope I could come back soon.I really miss the life there!
117165,36005245,2015-06-24,29291198,Heidi,I came to this place really needing a place to relax because I had a really intense training I was coming to the city for. The minute my GPS led me down the road to Judith's house after a 10 hour day of training was just what I needed..The road leading up to Judith's is a treat as you are right down by the water (Puget sound) and it relaxed me even before I got to her house. Her cat Kiki (sp?)is waiting for you when you get to the house as was so adorable! And Judith makes you feel right at home...Thanks for the great place to stay Judith...I will be recommending your place to others and will come back for sure! :)

117165,44797334,2015-08-29,20989439,Anne,"Judith was an absolutely lovely hostess. She was very kind and ensured we had everything we needed. The house itself was gorgeous, and getting to stay there was very much a pleasure; her view from her front porch is the sort that soothes the soul. 

The room was comfortable and the bed was warm - we slept very well. The bath was clean and lovely. All in all, I've rarely felt so welcome, and if we get the chance to come back to Seattle in the future I would be delighted if we could stay again. 

Seattle is an easy water taxi ride, drive, or Uner/Lyft from the city, if you're worried about the distance. "
117165,46013296,2015-09-07,6228678,Samarth,"Me and my girlfriend stayed with Judith over the labor day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Judith is a remarkably wise, generous and welcoming host and shared lots of tips/suggestions for our short trip. The house is very well managed and has great collection of books and varied art. It is also easily accessible from I-5 and just 15 min from the airport. Due to our packed schedule we came home late pretty much on all nights but she was very accomodating. We'll definitely try to rebook her place on our next visit to Seattle ! Thanks. "
117165,51052091,2015-10-17,19756684,Cody,"The pictures don't lie, folks. This home is gorgeous and the view was unmatched. Judith is pure class and was very welcoming. Just a quick tour around the house, an introduction to her charming kitty and we were on our way to a lovely week.

In truth, my review should go under her ""entire-home"" version of this posting, as Judith graciously let us book the whole place. With that, I'd like to mention its worth every penny doing so. The jetted tub and fold-out bed in the loft (best view of the Sound) made for some pretty unforgettable mornings. For my second ever AirBnB stay - this place made up for my less-than-impressive debut stay ten-fold.

If you're staying in Seattle. Book with Judith.  "
117165,57703036,2015-12-28,3996151,Michele,"We so enjoyed our time at the Judith’s home, exceptional hospitality and we felt like one of the family. The main house, common area rooms are all beautiful, spacious, clean and comfortable AND THE VIEW! The photos don’t lie. Tranquil night sleep in the Suite room and good strong coffee in the morning. We are pretty low maintenance so we didn’t require much of Judith, though she graciously offered.  While it was good to have a place to lay our sleepy heads, the pleasant surprise was the great time getting to know our hostess. Thank you Judith, we’ll be back!"
7388225,41252157,2015-08-05,842061,Sarah,Great apartment in the middle of Capitol Hill in Seattle.  We lived in Seattle for many years and picked this place as it is in our old neighborhood. The space was BEAUTIFUL and exceeded our expectations. It and Magic were incredibly welcoming with lots of extra special touches. We had a great time on the trip and would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Seattle. 
314180,974226,2012-03-06,1822115,Leah,"This home is incredibly charming & comfortable.  The views are amazing from the 2nd floor balconies!  The neighborhood is lovely, quick walk to Gasworks Park, cafe/bakery, restaurants & bars.  I had a great visit with family in Cam's home, we had everything we needed to prepare meals, plenty of room to relax, and we all slept soundly in comfortable beds.  Cam was very easy to communicate with.  The info. sheet on the property & neighborhood answered any questions that we may have had.  This property has so many wonderful details, and the host is a super nice, gracious guy who (if you are as lucky as us) might leave you chocolates & whiskey!      "
314180,1437284,2012-06-08,2243716,David,"We were extremely pleased by our stay in Wallingford.  Cam's home is very well kept with a modern, spacious kitchen and living area.  The location, location, location is simply excellent with very nice restaurants within walking distance.  Two couples share the home while attending a family graduation making the stay very cost efficient.  This was our first experience with airbnb and we couldn't have been more pleased.  "
314180,1465506,2012-06-12,2099181,Lynn,"My family absolutely enjoyed a week-end at this home.  Roomy bedrooms with comfortable beds. Well equipped kitchen for preparing meals. We love the city view from the balconies.  Wallingford is not walkable to downtown Seattle but the house is in a very  quiet neighborhood, every house has an interesting well kept flower garden that truly makes our daily walk an enjoyable affair.. This location is quite central for driving to various attractions"

We really enjoyed our stay.  Our purpose was to visit our extended family but I can totally see any visitor to Seattle will have a wonderful stay there.
You can go explore Seattle by walking (Wallingford itself has a lot to offer), with public transit (conveniently located) and come back to the beautiful home....  Highly recommended.
Thank you,  Cam!"
314180,2107913,2012-08-27,1982019,Jin,"Cam's place is a little gem in nice quiet neighborhood.  I could see stars from his windows and balcony, the bed was comfortable, and on the street parking was easy.  He was very accommodating to all our needs including early check-in and late check-out.  Also quick reply on emails and texts.  The house is kept clean and neat, with detail touches to make the guests feel relaxed and welcome.  A walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and the water front.  Old gas park about 2 blocks away is a great place to run and watch the seaplanes.  Will be back for longer stay next time. "
314180,2341907,2012-09-19,2077097,Laurie,My Family stayed here for our September Wedding.  Everybody loved the space and location!  Cam is very easy to work with and extremely helpful!

Cam was communicative and helpful throughout the trip. "

314180,4776006,2013-05-25,5760491,Natalie,"I do a lot of travel and normally try and find unique hotels but decided to try AirBnB as I had a longer stay. It was a great start. Cam was very easy to work with and the property is amazing. I really appreciate the work put into the house and the many great features including the entertainment set-up, the kitchen, the balconies, the coat hooks, a chalk board! Highly recommended...unless of course I would like to book at the same time. 

Thank you Cam for your responsiveness and flexibility. "
314180,5081798,2013-06-11,6041346,Dan,"Cam is a very nice man who gave us special consideration on an issue when he did not have to.

I would highly recommend renting from him.

314180,5206734,2013-06-18,5726396,Leslie,"Cam was extremely hospitable and helpful, right down to the detailed welcome packet he compiles for his guests. This was by-far the most gorgeous place I've ever had the pleasure of staying at, and it was really rough to leave it behind. The house has surprising, stylish details at every turn, and - above all - was extremely comfortable. Seriously, I want to track down the bedspread and get one myself! 

The location is great; walking distance to many Seattle landmarks, restaurants and bars, yet quiet enough to get some rest when you need it. 

Thank you, Cam, for being so great and lending us your home for an extended weekend! "
314180,6750084,2013-08-24,5284943,Alexander,"Cam blew our expectations away: the house is in the perfect area of Seattle, we enjoyed living in his house a lot. Cam is a great host, always answered any of our questions immediately, we gratefully thank AirBNB and Cam for the awesome stay the last 10 weeks in Wallingford.
We love you, Seattle :-) Katinka & Alex"
314180,6931625,2013-08-31,4295288,Stephen,"This wonderful house provided a great setting for a week in Seattle. It is beautiful, comfortable, and conveniently located.
The host, Cam, was super responsive to all my inquiries.
I would highly recommend a stay here."
314180,9439145,2013-12-29,8733148,Leigh,"We just spent a fabulous week at Cam's house. It was exactly as advertised - a lovely space, perfectly clean, with goodies left by our host. Cam was very accommodating in setting up an air mattress so we could all fit comfortably and was in touch to make sure we understood everything about the house. A neighbor even came over with cookies!  His hospitality and care about our experience made spending the Christmas holidays in Seattle a memorable experience. We will be back!"
314180,14336163,2014-06-17,11369780,Aleta,"Cam was a perfect host, providing us with complete information about the house and the neighborhood.  He thoughtfully provided several printed guides about things to do in Seattle and kept in touch via text to make certain everything was to our satisfaction.  Lovely home and very conveniently located to shops, restaurants, parks and the University of Washington.  All amenities were provided and the home was beautifully decorated and furnished.  Our stay was great!"
314180,15027173,2014-07-01,11541905,Barbara,"I really enjoyed the nearly two weeks I spent in Cam's beautiful home in Wallingford.  The pictures on the site are excellent, and still they don't do the interior justice.  It is spacious and full of light, and the views from the upstairs are spectacular.  In June when I was there, the trees had leaves on them, and it was a little bit of heaven to sit out on the balcony in the cool breeze with a glass of wine, gazing out at the Seattle skyline and Mount Rainier.  The neighborhood is very quiet even though it is within walking distance of Green Lake, Fremont, the town of Wallingford and the UW campus, and while I had a car during my stay, public transportation will take you to Cam's front door.  I highly recommend this property and its owner, who was gracious and always available if I had questions.  You can't miss with this house!"
314180,15744591,2014-07-15,11773230,David,"While we were very busy during our stay in Seattle we were delighted to be able to come back to our ""away home"" to be able to relax and enjoy the neighborhood and the house. Cam was very informative and kept in touch throughout the time there. The place is beautiful and if the need ever arises we would definitely stay here again. 

Thanks Cam!

314180,32981406,2015-05-24,27145585,Sally,Cam was as good a host as you could hope for and his house was fabulous. It was beautiful and comfortable and situated in a great area and Cam was relaxed and accommodating. We would recommend it highly.
314180,35069413,2015-06-15,29005617,Louise,Our stay in this home was perfect.  The owner made us feel very welcome; there was all sorts of interesting info about Seattle left for us in the kitchen along with a very nice note.  He was available by email or phone if we had questions and always answered promptly.  He went way beyond the basics when he fixed the grill for us so we could make food for a small party.  The house is beautiful and had everything we needed and was very clean; I wish it was mine!  We would happily stay there again and again and recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle!
314180,46367878,2015-09-10,15334723,Sharon,"Cam's house is in a beautiful leafy part of Seattle, close to the bars and restaurants of Fremont but with a more laid back atmosphere. It is a fantastic location to base yourself. We booked for just over 3 weeks and had a wonderful time. Cam is an extremely helpful and friendly host, and gave us lists of cool things to do before we arrived and left guidebooks out for us to use while we were there. The house is AWESOME - stylish and comfortable - wish it was our house! We would definitely stay here again."
314180,47096678,2015-09-15,1793405,Annie,"My family of three lives in Seattle -- when my mom and brother were flying in from the east coast to celebrate her 65th birthday, we wanted to stay under one roof. And my small home wasn't going to cut it. I chose Cam's listing because I'm familiar with his neighborhood and our family loves a good front porch. We could easily walk to bagels and coffee in the morning (Eltana!), take a short walk to a gorgeous view of Seattle's skyline (Gasworks Park!), and shoot over to the nearby grocery store (QFC!) before cooking dinners in the great kitchen. Added bonus: when my mom was ready for bed, the rest of us were ready for some nightlife (Fremont!).  Couldn't recommend this spot enough for a true Seattle visit. 

The house is big enough that we each felt there was space to be alone when we wanted it, but welcoming enough that we spent many hours together around the coffee table. Perfect place for our family weekend.

Cam is kind, professional, and, communicative.

314180,48021117,2015-09-22,28994623,Kyla,"Cam's house is perfect! I was worried about finding a place that would accommodate 5 adults -comfortably-, and I hit it out of the park with this place. The home is beautiful and comfy with great views of the skyline, including the Space Needle and Queen Anne! Communicating with Cam was easy and he is a super nice guy. I hope we can come back again!"
314180,55388698,2015-12-01,14654336,Anjuli,"Can was excellent about communication and super pleasant to deal with. His place is pretty rad. It has a lot of character and is extremely spacious. Beautiful large windows in the living room area, ample kitchen space for multiple cooks. Great neighborhood and easy street parking (for Seattle). Had easy access to W/D in basement. Would definitely stay here again."
7501919,41264212,2015-08-05,39344640,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful stay in downtown Ballard!  The apartment was beautiful, almost brand new, and very comfortable.  We were close to tons of restaurants and entertainment as well as being just a short drive to all the downtown attractions.  Thank you for your hospitality!"
7501919,42448164,2015-08-13,15274689,Angela,The location is great with many restaurants and shops. The Shishole Marina and other landmarks are near by.  The host Jennifer is a very pleasant and attentive person .  The apartment  is very clean and the bed is comfortable for 2.  There is a wonderful terrace on the roof to relax and BBQ too. I am very happy we chose this place.
7501919,43539934,2015-08-20,10114893,Frank,"This was a wonderful experience for us! The place was even nicer than it was described. It was exceptionally clean and modern. The appliances (stove, refrigerator, washing machine, dryer, etc.) all looked new, and all worked perfectly.  The bed was very comfortable, plenty of pillows, and the apartment was furnished beautifully and tastefully. There were clean dishes, utensils, pots, pans, coffee maker - perfectly set up.  Plenty of closet space. Iron, ironing board, hangers.  

We were close to everything on Market Street (easily walkable).  No problems with noise at night, and there was a great rooftop grill and club room where we cooked a dinner one night. 

Whenever we had questions, our hosts communicated with us right away - I don't think we ever waited longer than a minute for a response, after sending a text.  

We had a great time, and a great experience - we'd definitely stay there again.  My main concern in this review is that I might be leaving out something wonderful - I'm positive, though, that I'm not leaving out anything negative, because, sincerely, there weren't any negatives!"
7501919,45997822,2015-09-07,6762263,Catherine,"It was a pleasure to meet Jennifer and stay in Ballard. The apartment building is brand new and located within walking distance of terrific bars, restaurants, and shopping. The apartment was exactly as pictured--and included a lovely ""welcome book"" with recommendations for eating & sightseeing. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to friends!"
7501919,47189611,2015-09-16,41409670,Judith,"Jennifer always answered texts promptly and met us with the keys. She was also very prompt and flexible about picking up the keys .
It might be helpful, like some vrbos to have a system where the renter could check in and out on their own. "
7501919,47744775,2015-09-21,23386815,Caroline,"Jennifer's place was absolutely PERFECT for exploring downtown Ballard. We could easily walk to tons of restaurants, bars, shops and the Sunday farmer's market. The apartment was super clean, comfortable and the building had great amenities like a rooftop and social room. Jennifer was very friendly, easy to work with and got back to us right away about any logistics. We had such a wonderful trip. "
7501919,50360165,2015-10-11,30019270,Paige,"The apartment was great! It's a new apartment and is actually much nicer than it appears in photos. The location is great if you plan to hang around in Ballard. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance. If you need to go downtown it's a bit of a drive. Jennifer was quick to respond to questions, and when she wasn't able to meet me to drop off the key, she sent a friend in her place. "
3396140,14896030,2014-06-28,11420719,Autumn,"Jeanna was amazing! She had to put up with our stupidity of locking ourselves out of the place, and graciously came back during a business dinner to let us back in... Place was very warm and cozy as well, and immaculate in terms of cleanliness.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place in Seattle =)"
3396140,15118846,2014-07-02,5901723,Katie,Jeanna was a wonderful host! The bedroom was very cute and cosy and the location was amazing - right in the heart of a great neighborhood. Jeanna was super helpful and made us feel very comfortable and welcome - even left some snacks to take along with us on our Seattle adventures. I'd gladly stay here again! 
3396140,15285123,2014-07-06,7099154,Dustin,"Jeanna was such a kind and accommodating host which made our stay at her place that much better. Her place is in a great location with lots of food and drink options within walking distance. She made sure we knew all the local gems and let us be, which we appreciated. "
3396140,15478062,2014-07-09,17625388,Quinne,"We stayed one night in Jeanna's fantastic little flat, located right in the heart of Capitol Hill. We didn't meet Jeanna, however she organised getting her key and parking ticket to us, without a problem. Her house was lovely, welcoming, and in a great neighbourhood. We highly recommend her place. Thanks so much for having us."
3396140,15595574,2014-07-12,16444678,Brett,"Jeanna was a great host! The location was perfect for exploring Seattle. Walkable to the marketplace, also close to many bus stops and zip car locations. Jeanna had many great recommendations for places to eat and people watch!  She very flexible in accommodating our late check in and check out times "
3396140,15934901,2014-07-18,7748763,Jacqueline,"Jeanna was the absolute sweetest, and her place is impeccably organized and clean. She was thoughtful enough to leave us notes in our room with recommendations for activities and places to eat around Seattle! All her suggestions were amazing.

She is responsive, thorough, and always made sure we felt at home. One of my favorite Airbnb experiences thus far. I would highly recommend! :)"
3396140,16124057,2014-07-22,3509844,Louis,"Jeanna's place is nice. It's a pleasant walk from downtown and it was a great way to visit friends for the weekend. I did not meet Jeanna personally, but she made sure I had everything I needed to be all set by myself. Towels, tea, wifi, and a comfy couch for reading.
"
3396140,16422249,2014-07-27,13928779,Ricardo,"Great place, location, and host! Jeanna and I didn't get a chance to meet, but her presence was definitely felt due to very helpful notes about the flat, area, and arrival/departure instructions. Capitol Hill is a terrific neighborhood with lots to do and Jeanna's suggestions are spot-on. Would definitely stay again :)"
3396140,16676400,2014-07-31,17888573,Stephanie,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Jeanna made it such a pleasant one.  I was in Seattle for work meaning endless meetings and it was so nice having such a calm place to come back to.  Leading up to the trip, she provided me with all the info I could possibly need to get around to my meetings and get to her place from the airport.  Once I got there, I found a list of suggested restaurants and activities in the neighborhood.  I even had to have a FedEx package delivered to her house and she helped me out with writing a letter for the delivery man to make sure it was left at the door while we were out.

All in all, it was an entirely positive experience and I would recommend Jeanna and her place to anyone visiting Seattle."
3396140,16815266,2014-08-02,3491393,Petra,"Jeanna's place is in an excellent location for great restaurants and so much more. The space is set up extremely well for guests and checking in and out was a breeze. We had the chance to chat with Jeanna briefly, but we were on our own in the apartment overnight."
3396140,17304741,2014-08-10,18772668,Jessica,"Jeanna was very efficient about getting things squared away but was also really patient with me as a new person on this site. Although I didn't end up meeting her, she made it extremely easy to stay there as well as park. She also left us great recommendations. Her apartment is right in the middle of Capitol Hill and we ended up walking everywhere because it is so convenient. I would recommend it to a friend that wanted to be able to walk about the city.  "
3396140,17524075,2014-08-13,18596691,Tammy,"Jeanna was great about communicating with me prior to my trip.  Never being to Seattle before, she was great with assisting me in getting from the train station to her place.  Jeanna keeps her place clean and I found my guest room to be very comfortable.  I loved the bed...it's very comfortable!  Jeanna left some snacks on the kitchen counter for me, which is a nice gesture.  I was not familiar with the Seattle neighborhoods prior to my trip, so the location of Jeanna's place was a gamble for me.  My gamble was a great bet as her place is easy walking distance to Pike/Pine street with the restaurants, shops and bars.  Most important to me was that her place is about a 20/25-min walk to downtown!  I would stay at Jeanna's place again and/or recommend it to friends/family."
3396140,17649048,2014-08-15,7695533,Roger A,"Nice clean place, clear directions, very helpful!
"
3396140,17949366,2014-08-19,1328621,Natalie,"The room is moderately appointed, clean, and comfortable. The location is perfect, close to all the Capital Hill hot spots but set back on a quieter residential street. Highly recommended!"

Extremely clear,warm and friendly host!

Clean, simple, beautiful and perfect location for enjoying Seattle. We both enjoyed Jeanne who went above and beyond.... Helping us with all kinds of info and directions, while also giving us privacy. We definitely want to return! "
3396140,18694557,2014-08-30,1416037,Alice,"Jeanna was a great host and made us feel right at home. The location is perfect, I would recommend anyone to stay here for a good few days in Seattle."
3396140,18852324,2014-09-01,1101488,Kelly,My wife and I stayed here for two nights and had a great stay. The apartment was clean and organized.  It was also  conveniently located. Jeanna sent us easy directions using public transportation. Additionally the apartment was about a 10 minute bus ride to Pikes Place. Jeanna was very kind and when she was at the apartment she was quiet and helpful. She also gave us excellent recommendations for things to do in the area.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  
3396140,18999010,2014-09-04,3093962,Karen,"All very easy and breezy here. Very comfortable bed. Nicely clean, sleek environment. A quick walk down the hill to the Pike Market. I needed a quiet and good night's sleep and that was just what I got. Jeanna is very organized and all goes smoothly when you stay at her well located him. Thanks to you, Jeanna."
3396140,19047319,2014-09-05,20416470,Ariel,Jeanna was so warm and welcoming! She did everything possible to make us feel comfortable. Her apartment is near a very vibrant neighborhood and still only a 30-minute walk to Pike's Place. We really enjoyed her local recommendations and the stay overall! Thank you!
3396140,19108731,2014-09-06,14812535,Tiffany,"Excellent stay! Jeanna made communication very easy about checking in and out. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and situated in an ideal location in Capitol Hill. She is a great and thoughtful host."
3396140,19141435,2014-09-07,19514314,Eric,"Jeanna was very helpful in advance with public transit instructions to get to her place from the airport and everything was as described. The apartment itself was lovely and everything was clean and tidy. There were even an extremely helpful list of recommendations written on the bedroom mirror if you were looking for places to go and handy ways to get around. For a first time airbnb'er, this was an excellent introduction to the service. I would definitely stay here again."
3396140,19307123,2014-09-09,7650677,Justin,"Great place, great location, great host!"
3396140,19530800,2014-09-14,6602588,Christine,"The apartment was clean and tidy and right off the 10 or 11 lines from downtown- very convenient. The room looks just as pictured.  There are a number of products for you to use in the bathroom, and she has a water jug in the kitchen.  After my last Airbnb experience, I appreciate a person who knows how to clean a bathroom.  Jeanna was only there one night of my stay.  She is very personable."
3396140,19972365,2014-09-21,21112330,Cameron,Jeanna is a very attentive and conscientious host. Her place is very clean and she has prepared thoughtful recommendations of the surroundings in Capital Hill neighborhood and of the City's best attractions; including a foodee's guide. Her place is really in the heart of it all and we would stay again without hesitation. 
3396140,20252942,2014-09-26,8015411,Anissa,"Jeanna was an absolute pleasure to stay with! She had a list of local restaurants, cafes, sight seeing activities for us to enjoy. Clean, quite space. Very accommodating to anything we needed, and a sweetheart!  "
3396140,20831696,2014-10-06,17273036,Chris,"Overall; our stay was very pleasant; the apt in general was in good shape; The neighborhood seem safe(becareful of the uneven sideways that can twist an ankle at night :-) ).  The room is a bit small (not much walking room/space) but for us; we are out most of the day and just come back to sleep; so it was OK.  

Jeanna was there for one night; she was welcoming and seem pleasant.  

Just make sure there is no misunderstanding(&keep your records): she tried to charge us an extra night thru Airbnb when we only stayed&booked 2 nights(I was bumped that she just assumed we stayed an extra night.  A simple conversation would had reveal the truth & took care of the misunderstanding).

The apt is definitely a good hike up capitol hill so if u are in good shape; then you have nothing to worry about else u might consider something in downtown.

The apt is definitely just walking distance from some great restaurants (just beware of the up hill hike).  It is not a big deal.  You can take bus #10 or #11.

"
3396140,21539851,2014-10-19,7226515,Emma,"Jeanna was a very warm and welcoming host. She was very responsive when reserving and planning our trip, and had written up suggestions for her favorite places to eat/drink/sightsee, which we definitely took advantage of! The apartment and room were just as advertised - Neat, clean, and in a great location with lots going on. My only complaint is that the bedroom was very small for two people, with not much room to unpack or move around. In that respect it seemed a bit expensive for the setup, but maybe rates are just higher in this area."
3396140,22615164,2014-11-10,18097997,Diego,"Jeanna's place was great-beginning with the location. It is truly in the middle of it all! I had a rental car because I was going to a wedding outside Seattle but did not even need to move it otherwise. The apartment itself is very cozy. Jeanna was also super pleasant to interact with, though she was actually not in the apartment the majority of my stay. She left many suggestions written for us and made herself available to anything we required. Very comfy bed...would recommend!"
3396140,23868752,2014-12-13,8097561,Adrian,"Jeanna sent over very clear instructions before my arrival, making check-in super easy. Her place is a 5-minute walk from Pike & Pine, my favorite area in Seattle, with so many excellent restaurants, bars, cafes, and shops. 

Also, Jeanna has conveniently left a list of her favorites written on the floor-to-ceiling closet mirrors in the bedroom. She's not kidding about the hot dog stand recommendation, either! "
3396140,24765640,2015-01-02,325000,Jacqueline,"Jeanna is a great host.  She made the effort of giving us transportation suggestions and directions to get to her place.  She even had a long list of places and restaurants she liked that she thinks we might enjoy.  The apartment is very clean and organized.  She  made sure that everything we might need is there.  Also, her apartment is located in Capitol Hill where there are a lot of good restaurants to choose from. It was also walking distance to downtown.  "
3396140,26184083,2015-02-06,7448809,Kirk,I enjoyed staying at Jeanna's place. It was comfortable and clean and close to all the places I wanted to visit on the Hill during my stay. Jeanna wasn't around much but we had a nice chat one evening. I'm hoping to stay there again on future work visits. 
3396140,26549512,2015-02-15,17538063,Stephanie,Jeanna was the most gracious host! Her place was super clean & neatly organized. All the stuff that was said to be provided was laid out nicely. She wrote helpful tips on where to eat and go sightsee and how to get around on the mirror in the guest room. Also she left maps of Seattle and bus routes to make getting around easier. She answered any questions I had instantly and never hesitated in asking if I had any more concerns. I would definitely recommend staying at her place to anyone coming to Seattle! She will do everything she can to make your trip enjoyable and easy! 
3396140,26923775,2015-02-22,26027650,Steve,"Hi Jeanna,
What a great apartment!  Quiet location, comfortable bed, nice shower.  The location couldn't have been any better as it was only one block from my daughters apartment right in the heart of Capitol Hill.  Sorry I didn't get a chance to meet you while there but will hopefully see you next spring when I come out to see my daughter again.  Would  highly recommend your place to anyone considering Seattle's Capitol Hill district and looking to stay in the ""Middle of it All"" .  Thank you for the Lemon Cherry coffee cake on Saturday.  It was delicious!
Best,
Steve "
3396140,27280465,2015-03-01,16342997,Cynthia,"While we never actually met our host, everything was exactly as described, no problem finding it or getting in. It was comfortable and quiet and super convenient!"
3396140,27502139,2015-03-06,7448809,Kirk,This was my second stay at Jeanna's. I love the location and the room was very comfortable.
3396140,28930801,2015-04-01,26309653,Anwesha,"Our trip to Seattle wouldn't have been the same without staying at Jeanna's! She immediately made us feel welcome and had plenty of suggestions for sightseeing etc. She's a wonderful host and a very friendly person. 
As for the apartment, the location is awesome. It's a quiet neighbourhood right on the bus line to downtown. The room is on the smaller side but immaculately clean and very well-organized. Jeanna had towels, bath stuff, snacks, tea nd coffee etc. for us so that was really convenient. She was also very considerate and let us keep our luggage past check out as we had a late flight.
Overall, my first experience with airbnb couldn't be better :)"
3396140,29351979,2015-04-06,2255036,Ife,"Very accurate listing. Jeanna is VERY welcoming and does everything to make your stay enjoyable and easy. The apartment is clean and in a great neighbourhood (Capitol Hill) which I just loved, great coffee shops, restaurants, cinemas, theatres etc all within blocks. Also generally it's very easy to get around - I actually walked everywhere which is a great way to see the city. Jeanna also has travel info available in the flat, and suggestions for places to eat/visit/see etc. She actually HOSTS you rather than just renting a room. "
3396140,30397351,2015-04-21,28968257,Rebekah,Jeanna was such a great host! She has a wonderful place in a great location - just steps away from all of the best bars in Capitol Hill. The room was super clean and cozy - check-in was easy! I love that she took the time to make sure that her guests have recommendations at their finger tips. Such a generous and kind person - one of the best Air B&B experiences I've had!
3396140,30960795,2015-04-29,8473765,Rose,"Jeanna was the ideal host. The check in process was easy and she was very responsive throughout my entire stay. I appreciated the thoughtful details Jeanna took the time to put in place: clean stack of towels, new soaps, coffee/tea, notes with restaurant recommendations, etc. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay and the location is ideal, walking distance from groceries, restaurants, and bars. Although I only saw Jeanna once during my stay, she was friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend staying at Jeanna's apartment. Thanks Jeanna!"
3396140,31831173,2015-05-10,5792487,Jeffrey,Everything was as advertised and Jeanna was incredibly helpful and accommodating. The neighborhood is neat and full of character. Definitely a great way to experience Seattle!
3396140,32191524,2015-05-15,4286,John,"This is an easy review to write.  It really comes down to three elements:
1) The place was spotless and extremely comfortable.  I have traveled a lot and I bet this was in the top 1% in terms of cleanliness.
2) The location was exactly as described; absolutely in the middle of the Capital Hill district.  You can walk anywhere in 5-10 minutes.
3) Jeanna was a very thoughtful host.  She did all of the little things that are unexpected to make my stay even more comfortable."
3396140,32636684,2015-05-19,14663809,Matthew,"Jeanna was very helpful and is clearly willing to go the extra mile to make sure her guests are comfortable. The bathroom was clean, the bed large and comfy, and the bedroom bullitein board filled with good suggestions for things to do in the city.

The location is ideally located right outside of the more urban parts of capitol hill so that it is relatively quiet but is a short walk from anywhere you would want to be. 

Would definitely stay here again."
3396140,33138800,2015-05-25,8523562,Fay,"Jeanna is very sweet, thoughtful and professional. Although we only met her once on the day before our scheduled arrival during our entire stay, she was responsive to any questions we had before and during our stay. She was very accommodating allowing us drop off our bags the day before when we happened to ride with friends downtown. This helped tremendously for us to take the bus to her place the next day. She ensured we were comfortable and had provided everything we needed, including a new blender for my morning veggie juice even though hers was broken when we booked the room. She has one of the best showers and bath amenties we have experienced, comparable to some of the 4/5 star hotel we stayed at before.  

The bedroom is cozy with a firm bed, roomy closet, and a couple light blankets. The apartment is a bit farther uphill than expected but it is still walkable downhill as advertised. We walked to Seattle Center daily to attend the folk life festival and took bus #8 back after dark. We enjoyed our stay at her nice, quiet, and cozy apartment. 

Thank you again Jeanna for our first airbnb experience. What a lovely stay!!  We will be back.
"
3396140,33478948,2015-05-28,9762218,Michael,Great host! Very nice and flexible!
3396140,33832830,2015-06-01,4457371,Sera,"Jeanna's amazing home has it all: location, comfort, cleanliness and efficiency. She puts SO much thought into the guest's experience, from communication to offering everything with a genuine heart. Every single thing was perfectly arranged and immaculate. Jeanna is an absolute angel and the best host we've ever met. She is so sweet, caring and resourceful! Even before we knew we needed something (like some fresh fruit or a recommendation), POOF! It was ready for us. Thank you for the amazing experience - especially for so generously offering us your parking permit and space to leave our luggage! You made our trip so efficient, fulfilling and unforgettable. The price is totally fair for the location and quality - highly recommended for couples on vacation. The room is so romantic and cozy."
3396140,34101527,2015-06-04,23267692,Gillian,Jeanna's place was great. It really was in the perfect location for us. 20 mins walk downtown and 5 mins to the Capitol Hill area (great restaurants) and the most beautiful parks. I'm glad we stayed here because it gave us an awesome overview of the city. If we had stayed downtown we may not have ventured out. I would recommend to anyone. 
3396140,34456575,2015-06-08,6351144,Eric,Great location on Capitol Hill.
3396140,35106433,2015-06-15,32928192,V Vien,Jeanna was incredibly welcoming and helpful! The directions were very clear and I was able to locate the place easily. Great location and wonderful neighbourhood!
3396140,35393408,2015-06-18,26650909,Caitlin,Jeanna made booking with her a breeze. Her home was warm and inviting. And take her up on her neighborhood suggestions! My boyfriend and I tried Nue for a quick bite and have said we will be back there on our next trip to Seattle!
3396140,36820622,2015-07-01,668767,Eva,"An amazing Airbnb experience! Jeanna's place is organized and spotless, not to mention in a central Capitol Hill location. Jeanna also has a lot of great recommendations, and even gave me valuable house hunting advice since I was in Seattle mostly to look for a new apartment. Definitely a super host and super spot! "
3396140,37080571,2015-07-04,10133248,Liz,"Jeanna was a great host--friendly, accommodating, and full of suggestions. She made my guest and I feel incredibly comfortable during our three-day stay. Also, Jeanna's listing was in a lively neighborhood and in a great location--I could walk nearly anywhere or take a short Uber ride. I highly recommend Jeanna's listing!"
3396140,37509529,2015-07-07,14453508,Angie,"Jeanna's place was a sweet apartment, a few stairs to navigate and once inside (getting my key was a fun treasure hunt!) I found my cozy room at the end of the hall.  There's a window in the room - so lots of natural lighting and a closet in which to put all my bags (or hang up clothes if needed).  The bed was so comfortable and clean and pretty.  The bathroom was ""typical apartment"" tile decor - and clean.  The street was relatively quiet, great tucked-away street. Read: safe, friendly neighbors, just a few blocks to the action on Pike and Pine Streets.
I was happy to have the use of her kitchen, I had some things to store in the fridge. Jeanna tipped me off about the neighborhood Farmer's Market (year round on Sundays), with marked-up maps. I was so delighted to find this! Found Washington's summer berry bounty there!
We met in person 2 times. She was so sweet and helpful with suggestions and happy to know what I was discovering in the neighborhood.  She made it ok to text or call her if I needed anything. I would definitely return to stay at her place."
3396140,37870397,2015-07-11,35055251,Eri,すてきな体験になりました！初めてのairbnbだったので最初は緊張しましたが、場所はわかりやすく、なによりもダウンタウンに近いというところが高得点です。バスならダウンタウンから１０分ほど、そして頻繁にきますので時間が無駄になりません。時間に余裕があるなら歩きをおすすめできるほど、ダウンタウンまでの通りにはおしゃれなカフェやレストランなどがたくさんあります。ホストのジーナさんもとても明るく迎えてくださり、何かあったらいつでも連絡してと、とても親切にしていただきました。お部屋ですが、タオルも用意されていて、清潔で、日本人の私でも気になるところはありませんでした。
3396140,38597565,2015-07-17,11248782,Tom,"Jeanna had great communication with us before and during our stay and everything was exactly as described. The place was very clean and convenient with nearby restaurants and a short walk to SeattleU. Jeanna had lots of suggestions for things to do in the area. Overall, a wonderful stay. "
3396140,38936886,2015-07-19,19248926,Caroline,It is obvious that Jeanna takes a lot of pride in being an Air BNB host. She had many options of things for us to do in Seattle listed in her guidebook and at the place. The room was clean and orderly. She was easy to communicate with and followed up with any questions and/or changes I had. 
3396140,39512195,2015-07-24,20243220,Natalya,"Jeanna has a perfect location for a first time or repeat Seattle explorer/vacationer, positioned one block from pine and 2 away from pike, we were happily introduced to the Seattle counter culture headquarter that makes it a top destination, sprinkled with happy hours and independent shops galore.  We ventured out a few more blocks and found another district we thoroughly enjoyed close to parks and famous viewpoints.  Regarding the the interior, we found it thoroughly easy to wade our way through the labeled kitchen and found it quite comforting to slip into the cozy queen size  bed.    "
3396140,40934067,2015-08-03,31350538,Beth,Jeanna was a fantastic host! We arrived late at night but the directions Jeanna provided from the airport to her place were extremely clear. Her home was extremely clean and well decorated. We loved the cork board in our bedroom that directed us to places to eat and hang out. The location was perfect for us. There were loads of bars and restaurants just around the corner and it was an easy walk/cheap lyft to downtown Seattle. This was a fantastic first airbnb experience for us! 
3396140,42383983,2015-08-13,32273620,Anne,"I had a great stay at Jeanna's apartment. Although I didn't get to meet Jeanna (she was away), she nevertheless made me very welcome and it was easy to communicate with her. Jeanna's notes and recommendations on how to get to her apartment, where things were in the apartment, places to go see and restaurants/cafes/bars to eat & drink at were all very detailed, organised and informative. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable, with plenty of space and tastefully decorated. The guest room has a comfortable double bed, plenty of wardrobe space and a bluetooth set of speakers to which you could connect your music device of choice. The kitchen was well equipped and both the kitchen and bathroom were very clean. Jeanna made me feel welcome to use both the kitchen and the lounge. The location was great, quiet but very near to the lively Pike/Pine areas with lots of cafes, restaurants and shops nearby. It was easy to walk to more central areas (20 minutes or so to downtown) or to catch buses nearby to places further afield (Jeanna provided plenty of information on public transport). I tried out one or two of her food recommendations and liked in particular the bagels at Eltana. The only minor downside was that when one of Jeanna's neighbours had a bit of a party on the Saturday night, some of the noise woke me up in the early hours of the morning, but it was only the one night out of seven nights that I stayed, and otherwise the neighbourhood was very quiet (plus not something that Jeanna can control, so it's not a real criticism!). I would strongly recommend Jeanna's place as a great place from which to explore Seattle."
3396140,43688941,2015-08-21,29540654,Emily,Highly recommended for any length stay in Seattle. Jeanne's apartment did not disappoint - it is in the best location for exploring lovely Seattle. The apartment itself is spotless and the room is also clean and very comfortable. Perfect amount of space for one or two people. Jeanne made me feel so welcome and accommodated my every need. She responded to all of my questions and gave me tips for getting off the beaten path in her city. I met her once during my three night stay and she is even more wonderful in person. Thank you Jeanne for hosting me and my brother!  Would definitely stay in your space again when back in Seattle.
3396140,44557951,2015-08-27,652848,StevenJon,"Jeanna was very friendly and helpful.  She gave us a parking pass so we wouldn't have any problems keeping our car nearby, and she gave us many useful suggestions.  There is a wonderful food co-op on 16th and Pine where you can buy all kinds of things at reasonable prices even if you are not a member.  Cal Anderson Park is less than two blocks away and frequently features professional musicians who are paid by the city to perform. The bed was comfortable and Jeanna was always respectful of our privacy.  The immediate area is quiet and it is a short walk to numerous restaurants and little stores."
3396140,44968655,2015-08-30,39867690,Scott,"Jeanna makes your stay very personable. Although our paths never crossed officially due to our schedules, we were very pleased with the accommodation.

The area was very central and served our purpose well.

Jeanne accommodated our last minute parking arrangements too.

We would definitely stay at Jeanna's home again."
3396140,45719866,2015-09-05,38831368,Kelly,Jeanna was an excellent host. Her apartment comfortably fit two people and was very convenient to restaurants/bars/sights. We walked almost everywhere. She was extremely communicative and provided excellent directions for getting to/from the airport as well as getting in the apartment. She went above and beyond by providing maps and recommendations for guests. We only had the chance to meet her on the last day as we were leaving but she was friendly and made us feel right at home. We would definitely stay here again if we were in town.
3396140,46168547,2015-09-08,7679118,Nichole,"Unfortunately, my husband and I did not get to meet Jeanna throughout our three day stay.   We some how kept missing one another.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed our accommodations and found Jeanna a completely helpful, kind host!  

The whole apartment was extremely clean.  As a former housekeeper, I have absurdly high standards and Jeanna surpassed them.  The bed was comfy and I loved the extra touches Jeanna put into the room, such as the cute suggestions bulletin board and our welcome message on the mirror.  It is obvious that Jeanna takes hosting seriously by how she takes care of her place.  

The neighborhood has a lot of choices in terms of food and drinks.  (Amazing ice cream shops and drinks!) We enjoyed the walk-ability of the area as well.  It was a nice walk to Pike Place.  In our three days exploring, we only used the bus once.  It was our first time visiting Seattle, and I couldn't imagine a more perfect location to stay.  I highly recommend this room!"
3396140,47191198,2015-09-16,11248782,Tom,Everything was just as Jeanna described. Communication before and during the stay was just right. 
3396140,48271951,2015-09-25,15190888,Nathan,"The apartment of Jeanna is located near the bustling Pine/Pike area with nice bars and restaurants. We were surprised about how quiet it was at night (with the windows closed). The bed is comfortable, it's clean and the communication with Jeanna, via the Airbnb app, was quick and friendly. It was nice to stay here for a night to explore downtown Seattle."
3396140,49232808,2015-10-02,7448809,Kirk,I had another great stay at Jeanna's place. I love the location and Jeanna is always very friendly and helpful.
3396140,50684619,2015-10-13,4950687,Wendy,"Unfortunately I did not get to meet Jeanna in person but I loved her place. Super cosy, close to everything and is everything she described it to be. Very clean too. Jeanna had everything well organized and planned out prior to my arrival. Would definitely stay again if I am back in Seattle and would definitely, 100% recommend to friends and family! "
3396140,51974470,2015-10-25,44547781,Isabelle,"Jeanna was my first Airbnb experience and I can easily say that I've been spoiled. If there is one thing in this world I appreciate more than anything, it is cleanliness, and Jeanna has far beyond exceeded my requirements. Apartment is SPOTLESS. Bed very comfortable, multiple towels provided, along with toiletries. Her kitchen was labeled making it very easy to navigate through. She even provided us a map of her favorite places around. I also loved the personalized note she wrote on our closet mirror! Never actually ran into her, but instructions were very clear and was easy to get in touch with. Overall, a very very wonderful and accommodating place to stay during our short trip. Short walk to Pike/Pine and a short Uber ride to downtown. Definitely worth it. My boyfriend and I decided that if we were to come back to Seattle, we would definitely try to book her apartment again! "
3396140,55262341,2015-11-29,35677601,Man,"My friend and I took a trip to Seattle during the thxgiving holidays, and  we feel so lucky to stay in Jeanna's place!  Jeanna has been thoughtful, considerate and very sweet. The bedroom is neat and clean and the bed is very comfortable!（Sound sleep guaranteed） Jeanna really attends to the details that she left us sweet welcome note( She's out for Thxgiving) and  she even provided a bose speaker. (which turned out to be very useful, I connected the speaker with my computer and watched hunger game with perfect sound effect, very cool experience !

3396140,56285237,2015-12-11,46475253,Adamno227,"Firstly the description of the location is accurate.  The house is in the middle of an exciting neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  Perhaps more importantly, the living space is, as described, so very nice.  The room was very clean and one could 'hang out' in the rest of the house.  Finally, Jeanna is a really nice person who makes a great effort to make her guest feel welcome.  I would definitely stay here again."
5930473,34065034,2015-06-04,374500,Melissa,"Lynda's cottage was absolutely perfect for my one-month stay and Lynda herself so kind and ensured I had everything I needed leading up to and during the stay. Her cottage is two stories (lower level is the garage with storage space and a washer dryer, and the living area is the upper level.) The cottage was very clean, nicely decorated and had beautiful natural light thanks to all the windows that looked out to trees and the rest of the neighborhood. I especially loved the balcony and often it felt more like I was staying in a cabin, which was awesome! Her cottage is also conveniently located. It's a minute's walk from the Burke Gilman trail and just a little further to get to a grocery store, cute restaurants, a coffee shop and nail salon. I have use AirBnb for several years now and I highly recommend Lynda's cottage. Lynda was so nice and she did an excellent job designing and building her cool and cozy cottage. Thanks, Lynda!"
5930473,44889234,2015-08-30,30264146,Gabriel,"I stayed in Lynda's apartment for three months during the summer, and it was perfect in every aspect - It is clean, well organized, and beautiful.
It is great for up to two people - My girlfriend came to visit me  for one month during my stay, and we both agreed that in a very short time we felt at home.
The neighborhood is very quiet during all hours of the day, and the neighbors are lovely, kind and welcoming.
Lynda was a great host, she promptly took care of every request I had during the summer, while respecting my privacy in the apartment at all times.

I wholeheartedly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle, and would love to come back myself! "
5930473,48995108,2015-09-30,34067193,Anne-Marie,"Fabulous studio apartment! Perfect size for me and my daughter as we  get to know Seattle. The neighbors are all wonderful, the location is perfect - close to the Burke Gilman trail (take your bike north or south and enjoy great views!) and an easy walk to a nearby bus station. Bus #65 is just a 15-20 minute ride to the UW campus. The apartment is clean and bright! Lynda has made settling in here a wonderful experience. I highly recommend her as a host!"
7227464,39670612,2015-07-25,11277884,Michele,"Andrea was VERY welcoming, going out of her way to prepare a ""travel"" manual [my words] for those coming in from out of town.  The location of the apartment was in a neighborhood convenient to downtown.  However, being in a neighborhood allowed you to escape the noise of the city, and walk in neighborhood parks.  The apartment was perfect for two people, with all needed amenities available."
7227464,40167078,2015-07-28,27542657,Alex,Loved the apartment! Key was ready in the lockbox and I didn't need to meet or interact with anyone. Everything in the apartment was brand new and made us feel like right at home. By far the best Airbnb experience I've had so far! We took advantage of the washer & dryer and came home with clean clothes. Internet was very fast. Loved the coffee and french press.
7227464,41116992,2015-08-04,36462004,Linda,"My husband and I stay at this lovely apartment. Although we never met the host, her apartment manager was available and very helpful. The apartment is exactly as described, perfect for one or two people and very clean. We were there for the record breaking heat wave and the fan came in handy. If you are used to a rural setting, the little bit of street noise might need getting used to.
We spent a lot of time in Green Lake and Ballard, and both were an easy drive.
Overall it was a great stay, in a really convenient location."
7227464,41989527,2015-08-10,11878123,Emily,"I arranged this stay for a family member visiting from out of town and it was the perfect situation for us.  The apartment is clean, quiet and comfortable with all the amenities we needed.  Andrea and her assistant, Greg were very responsive and attentive.  I live and work in the Queen Anne, Magnolia area and it's nice to have such a great option in the neighborhood for my out of town visitors!  "
7227464,42571012,2015-08-14,38881839,Samantha,"My experience at Andrea's place is Seattle was awesome. The place is pretty small, but not crowded or stuffy. Perfect size for two. The kitchen has all of the necessities you need, the pull-out couch is great for relaxing, the moveable TV wall mount is a huge convenience, and the bathroom has very large and soft towels. We did not interact with anyone the whole time we were there, but that was exactly how we wanted it. Andrea was still very welcoming over email/message and she really prompted us to contact her or the property manager if we needed anything at all (of course we didn't, because the apartment had everything we needed). Having a lock-box at the front door with the key is a perfect idea for this type of hosting. 

There were little things about this apartment that showed Andrea really cares about the people staying here. Netflix and Hulu Plus are already installed and logged in to the SmartTV, there was ice in the ice trays in the freezer, and there was an already-filled water filter in the fridge. 

I am personally a huge fan of blankets, and she provided extra blankets that made the place very homey. I also can't sleep without a fan, and even though it was never too hot during our trip, the box fan was a great convenience. 

The only thing my boyfriend and I had some trouble with is the bed being a bit too short for him. I am 5'4'' and it was not a problem at all, but he is 6'2'' and his feet hung over just a slight bit.

Altogether, the place is wonderful and I would rent from Andrea again and recommend her to anyone."
7227464,43120693,2015-08-17,39777221,Nour,"Really excellent! Andrea was extraordinarily helpful, very responsive, and overall just really easy to work with. The apartment was spotless, airy, and very well stocked with amenities. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
7227464,43797943,2015-08-22,7659656,Carlos,"Andrea is one of the best hosts I've ever had. She has thought of everything! By providing us with a detailed guide to her home and neighborhood, all of our needs were met. Having never been to Seattle, I was unsure of how accessible Downtown Seattle and it's many great neighborhoods. Magnolia was the perfect location to stay. Magnolia was only 5-10 minutes from Downtown Seattle, Queen Anne, Ballard, and Freemont. We loved the quiet neighborhood so much we looked at home listings on Zillow. Let's talk about Andrea's home. It was better than ours and so much better than an overpriced hotel. While on the smaller side for a home, though larger than a hotel room, we were extremely comfortable. We loved the modern look and feel, and appreciated the new appliances. Let's talk about how clean this place was. No carpet, hypoallergenic sheets, pillows, etc. The place is well taken care of. "
7227464,44436426,2015-08-26,23159811,Jana,"Wow! Andrea was above-and-beyond great to work with! Timely, thorough, and specific info. And when we had a last-minute snafu with our schedule, she was responsive and helpful. (Thanks again, Andrea!)

And the place was great! Even though it's an apartment, it feels very private. Each entrance is secluded. The kitchen was well-equipped, and just big enough. The bus stop is literally several steps from the building, and in about 9 minutes, you're at Seattle Center; a few more to Pike Place. It was a great base for our five-day stay to visit family and see the city."
7227464,45117731,2015-08-31,19989536,Lalitha,"Andrea was a great host and her apartment was exactly as described. The location was quiet, and it was easy for us to get around (we used Uber, but public transportation was definitely easy to access). 

Andrea and her property manager, Greg, were great communicators, which we really appreciated. I would definitely stay here again!"
7227464,46148348,2015-09-08,2707681,Sandy,"Andrea is a wonderful host! Her apartment is clean, modern, well equipped and at one of the best areas in Seattle. Communication with Andrea was fantastic as well, she is really detail oriented and send us instructions days prior to our arrival. I really appreciate her checking in during our trip as well. We would definitely stay here again when we return to Seattle!"
7227464,46500873,2015-09-11,31995670,Veronica,"Andrea’s communication is stellar! All the information we needed to know about the apartment (as well as neighborhood and Seattle attractions) was clearly and promptly provided to us before our arrival, and she also made herself available for any questions during the stay. The apartment is as described, comfortable, very clean, and quiet; the on-street parking was also ample and safe. Andrea is a great host and I would recommend this apartment for a vacation in Seattle. It’s a great place to rest and relax after walking the many hills in Seattle!"
7227464,47059396,2015-09-15,18652212,Jennifer,"Andrea's unit is perfect for a short stay in Seattle - providing all the comforts of home - with Andrea being an incredibly warm and attentive host.

The one item I would note to those looking to stay without a car, is that the unit is a bit removed from the city (not walkable) - with public transit, or Uber, being a necessary to see many of the sights and sounds Seattle is so famous for.

7227464,47731007,2015-09-21,26227723,Kimmy,"The place was great, very clean and perfect for the two of us. Well stocked and in a great location. Was easy to find as well. Will consider this place in the future."

7227464,49238274,2015-10-02,42917178,M,"Everything was perfect - any details I needed were all shared via email and quickly, the host is extremely pleasant and helpful,  I was able to get in via lockbox at my convenience, the place was easy to find and centrally located. The apartment is perfect for a one-two person group. I used it while on a week long business trip and it had everything I needed. It was a little hideaway quiet and beautiful views walking or running in the area very close to town."
7227464,49901675,2015-10-07,12120448,Rob,Andrea and Greg were great at making us feel welcome.  We arrived late but they arranged the keys for us.  All the amenities were there and the apt is in a great neighborhood.  Andrea made a long list of things to do in the area and we had a blast.
7227464,51028944,2015-10-17,16380235,Christine,The location was perfect for any first time visitors to Seattle! Andrea's directions were perfect and the amenities were amazing. The bus stop located directly outside the complex takes you directly to downtown which worked perfectly for us. The neighborhood was quite and so lovely. We would definitely stay here again!

370361,1075385,2012-04-02,1757208,Colleen,Sheldon is a kind and generous host.  The studio is very nice and clean in a quiet neighborhood. The queen bed was very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep.  We enjoyed being able to walk to a grocery store and local coffee shops. Ken's Market has everything you'd need.  Sheldon's sightseeing and dining recommendations were excellent.  He took the time to print out information on things to do and places to go in the area. We would certainly stay here the next time we are in Seattle.  
370361,1129366,2012-04-14,1995022,Stephen,"Sheldon is super helpful and a great host...his studio is very new, clean and comfortable...highly recommended....great spot on Phinney Ridge"
370361,1290263,2012-05-16,2080356,Megan,"Sheldon's studio is on a lovely street in a great neighborhood. The table and outside patio are nice as well, while the inside is beautiful and well-maintained with the extras, like a nice tv and warm bathroom floors. The bed is super comfortable! Sheldon is a pleasant and trustworthy host."
370361,1393185,2012-06-01,1989353,Patrick,"Fantastic 2 week stay! Sheldon is a most gracious host, who could be called Mr. Seattle for all of his insight into the city. His recommendations were great! The neighborhood is very comfortable and walkable, a great spot for a base camp - the rest of the city is so close - although the streets right around Sheldon's place offer plenty to explore. The studio was very comfortable -> super comfy bed, everything very clean and well taken care of. Enjoyed my 2 week stay at Sheldon's very much."
370361,1445057,2012-06-09,2479220,Kevin,"Sheldon's suite was tidy, comfortable and quiet and worked very nicely for my stay.  Thank you!"

370361,1515570,2012-06-19,921369,Rick,"A wonderful spot in a great Seattle neighborhood, convenient to most everything we like about Seattle, such as Greenlake, the Zoo, bus lines, PCC, Ballard and the Greenwood district.. Great walkable location, seems private and secluded. Sheldon is a great host and an avid gardener. We would definitely stay here again."
370361,1569732,2012-06-26,2585007,Nicole,It is a really pleasant and nice room with very quite environment. My parents had great time staying here! The host is also very nice and patient . It is definitely a great place to stay during vacation in Seattle! Strongly recommended!!!
370361,2157081,2012-09-01,2192675,Celinda,"I am a single female and, while looking for a place in Seattle for a two-month stay during summer, it was my good fortune to find Sheldon’s guest studio available.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I needed something affordable, safe, and quiet but also in a convenient location.  In addition, because I was to live alone during my Seattle stay, I didn’t need a large place. This studio met all my requirements - a nice size room, full bath with tub, a nice sized refrigerator and bar with microwave and coffee pot.  Since I did limited food preparation during my stay, the lack of a kitchen wasn’t a problem for me.  The studio has its own private restricted access entrance. It also has a small outdoor patio with a table and two chairs situated under a nice shade tree.

There were a number of other things that made my stay special.  First, there was Sheldon the landlord/owner.  You would be hard pressed to find anyone nicer, more thoughtful, or more accommodating than Sheldon.  He made certain that I was comfortable and responded to my every request eagerly and with good humor.  Sheldon has that trait that everyone wants in a host, the ability to take exceptional care of his tenant without being intrusive.  He also knows Seattle very well and can be depended upon for recommendations of things to see and do. Second, there is Phinney Ridge, the great little neighborhood community where the studio is located.  Besides being lined with wonderful well kept older bungalow-styled homes and populated with friendly people, it is a great neighborhood to walk, run, or bicycle.  Numerous shops, restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops are within easy walking distance.  It is also within walking distance to Green Lake Park with its great lakeside walking, riding, and cycling trail.  Finally, and very important to me, Sheldon’s Place is bright, clean, and I felt completely at home during my entire stay.  
 
I would definitely stay at Sheldon’s studio again and I highly recommend it!"
370361,2206428,2012-09-05,1771388,Carla,"The room was very tastefully appointed with a very comfortable bed. There is a private outside entrance with a small table, chairs and bbq grill available. There are nice chairs and table inside for a quick breakfast or happy hour, a microwave and fridge and a few dishes for enjoying the take-out leftovers from the many neighborhood pubs and cafes. Coffee can be enjoyed at many nearby cafes after strolling through this leafy and quiet residential neighborhood. Sheldon was a very helpful and knowledgeable host!"
370361,2345131,2012-09-19,3200143,Terri,This was an absolutely lovely place to stay.  Very comfortable and quiet and the little private patio area was great for relaxing after a long day.  A great neighborhood and having the market so close was a huge bonus.  Sheldon was a perfect host as well.  I hope to be able to stay there again on my next trip to Seattle.
370361,2371895,2012-09-22,2044950,Scott,"Great apartment -- spacious, well decorated room with amenities (mini-fridge, dinnerware, microwave, cable tv, internet, etc.) and attached bathroom.  We got into the unit a little late (11pm), so Sheldon just set up an entry code so we could let ourselves in.  Unit is attached to Sheldon's house, but is totally contained within itself and the entry code really made it feel private.

The two times that we spoke with Sheldon (casually ran into him outside the morning after we arrived/day we left), he was incredibly helpful in guiding us to fun activities in Seattle (theo's chocolate factory, bun shop at pike's place) and on our drive down to Portland (St. Helen, really cool bonsai gardoen).  Very responsive to text messages as well and nearly instantly confirmed our request to stay here. 

Quiet little neighborhood -- good food nearby (recommend Mr. Gyros - (website hidden)).  Taking the bus into downtown (about 25 minutes) wasn't a problem -- it picked up a 2 minute walk away, ran on time, and drivers were really nice/efficient.

We chose this unit over a hotel that was near the Space Needle and charged $120/night. Man, are we glad about that -- Space Needle is in a sketchy area and it wouldn't have been nearly as comfortable.  Even with a couple of $25 cab rides back from downtown ($27, including tip from Amtrack), this was still way cheaper.

Highly recommend for anyone on holiday/vacationing in Seattle."
370361,2436517,2012-09-28,3315307,Christina,The room was very clean and furnished nicely. The bathroom was just right  and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood is charming and quiet.  The host was very accomodating. I would return here.
370361,2492244,2012-10-02,3702711,Leslie,"My father needed a place to stay while visiting me and my family for the weekend. We live near Green Lake and the hotels in the vicinity are not worth the prices, so we found this wonderful studio with kitchenette, full bath for a very good price. The neighborhood is one of my favorite in Seattle, the house is beautiful and the studio is very nice. Much nicer than a hotel room in the area. The host was wonderful--he accommodated us the same day of booking and was friendly and helpful. I'm recommending this place to my friends and family from now on! Very comfortable, private, clean, and nicely decorated."
370361,2551467,2012-10-08,3732247,Robyn,"This place was perfect for me! Nice quiet neighborhood close to shops and restaurants, and the accommodations were squeaky clean and comfortable. Sheldon was wonderful about guiding me to area restaurants and sharing his awesome, home-grown tomatoes! I really can't recommend this property highly enough and will definitely be staying on my next trip to Seattle. Thank you!"
370361,2644462,2012-10-17,3760511,Maria,"I had the most amazing time in Seattle, a truly great experience. Sheldon lives in Phinney Ridge which is this awesome community with so much to see in walking distance. Sheldon, was a great host and a really nice person. He gave us great information about the city, and the local area. He was very attentive to our needs and his studio is perfect! Very cozy, clean, and comfortable, and lots of privacy! I fell in love with Seattle and it's tucked away treasures like Phinney Ridge!"
370361,2759162,2012-10-30,138503,Yvonne,"Great location  within walking distance of coffee and a quaint store.
The bed was so comfortable.  The host cordial and respectful of privacy.
Would return."
370361,3018715,2012-12-03,4199746,Steve,This worked out really well for us and appreciated finding this place at Phinney Ridge.  It was a nice place and provided what we needed for our four day stay. 
370361,3144740,2012-12-24,1648168,Marianne,"I really enjoyed my stay at Sheldon's studio.  The location is wonderful, and the place itself is well-appointed, quiet and comfortable.  I hope to return when the weather is more favorable!"
370361,3313117,2013-01-08,2050760,Amelia,"Our experience at Sheldon's studio could not have been better. It's beautifully furnished and very comfortable. Plus, it is ideally located, close to bustling shops, cafes + transport. Sheldon was a fantastic host - flexible, communicative and full of insider's advice. We can't wait to return! Highly recommended."
370361,3449111,2013-01-31,2315832,Abbie,"We needed a 6-night stay at the last minute when other arrangements fell through on a trip to Seattle combining a family visit for the two of us and a professional conference for me. We needed a place with wi-fi and a private bathroom that would give me an easy-enough commute to and from downtown that would also be comfortable for my partner as a home base while I was out. Phew! Sheldon saved the day! 

His place is just as pictured and described. We really appreciated having both a clothes closet and a pantry/scullery closet. Sheldon clearly put good thought as well as good taste into appointing the room. The kitchenette is spare and little bit tight quarters next to the bed, but has everything you need. The full set of dishes includes two wine glasses and a bottle opener, and there is a dish tub with dish cloth, soap etc. in the pantry. The wi-fi is great, with outlets everywhere you need them, including a surge suppressor power strip beside the bed. Nice!

As others have said, Sheldon is a mellow and kind host. If you need anything, just ask. All we really missed was a bath mat, and a second full set of bath towels. We called Sheldon, and he brought a bath mat--and washed and replaced the towels for us not once but twice during our stay.

If you spend much time in the room during the day you may feel a bit in a fishbowl despite the privacy of the fence outside your entrance. Curtains instead of or in addition to the blinds on the glass entry door would help with this, I think. That said, the street is quiet, the furniture is all comfortable, and the room is beautiful. As everybody says, the bed is cushy-cozy and gave us wonderful sleep.

The neighborhood is terrific. We could always find parking on the street within 1/2-block of the door. There are all kinds of restaurants and shops in walking distance up and down Greenwood--and the public library, too. Ken's Market is a short walk south on Greenwood, and the PCC Co-op is a quick drive away on Aurora. We had a fabulous meal at Yanni's, and Diva Espresso is lovely. 

The #5 bus on Greenwood takes you to and from downtown in 20-25 minutes, taking you past Woodland Park Zoo and through Fremont on the way (don't miss Fremont while you're in Seattle!). Walk up to 85th and catch the #48 to the University District. It's also easy to get around by car from here.

Thanks again, Sheldon!"
370361,3514789,2013-02-11,851906,Jim,"Sheldon was a great host who did everything he could to make our visit a great one.  It's a great location that is close to Green Lake and downtown and  within walking distance of several good restaurants including Chef Liao's (order the black bean chicken chow fun), Red Mill, and a 3 minute drive to our favorite pizza - ever - Veraci Pizza.  Also a short drive to Golden Gardens Park, a beautiful beach on Puget Sound with an awesome view of the Olympic Mountains."
370361,3596669,2013-02-20,1648168,Marianne,"Great location, great studio, great host!"
370361,3709056,2013-03-06,3200143,Terri,"I just came back from my second stay at Sheldon's and it was just as great as my first, if not better.  The room is perfect for me and Sheldon is such a great guy that I am beginning to feel like family.  My 4 year old granddaughter recognizes his house and always want to come and tell Sheldon hello.  I love staying here and will be back again soon.  "
370361,3766955,2013-03-12,1552666,Cass,"Sheldon's place is very nice.  It's nice to have easy chairs, a table, some basic kitchen things, and a comfortable bed.   There are many amenities close by.  Sheldon is willing to help in any way.  I'd happily stay there again!
"
370361,3927168,2013-03-28,2044255,Danica,"What a perfect location!!! Easy access to anywhere via bus, plenty of entertainment and dining options within walking distance. Very cool and safe door locks.  EXTREMELY comfortable bed! And don't worry if you're tall, being 6'3"" was no issue here! Love the added bonuses of great furnishings, appliances, and especially the towel warmer! We will definitely stay here again!"
370361,4474642,2013-05-07,5539808,Joan,"This is my first time using airbnb and the experience has been excellent from the first contact with Sheldon to the time we said goodbye. I booked for one month and extended another nine days. 
This is also my first time in Seattle and have many requirements for an extended stay. Sheldon's place meets all of them. His studio room is impeccable and homey in a nice, quiet and safe neighbourhood. I love the private entrance and the sweet little garden. The place is as what the photos show and I was very reluctant to leave after being slightly attached to it.
Sheldon is a fantastic host. If not for his tips on where to go and what to do, I would not have enjoyed Seattle as much. 
There are beautiful parks, restaurants, shops, supermarkets, public library, yoga studios and interesting places within walking distance or short drive away.
Bus stop for Metro No.5 to Downtown is a 2-minute walk and the ride is about 30 minutes one way. Its very convenient to get to Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum, International District and the various tourist attractions. 
Timing was great too. Managed to see the cherry blossoms and spring flowers in full bloom. When the sun comes out, Sheldon invited me to plant tomatoes with him in his back garden.
Many thanks to my fabulous host for making my first time to Seattle a wonderful experience. 
Highly recommend Sheldon's place for a comfortable, private stay and I will definitely come back when I have the chance to.
Thanks, Sheldon."
370361,4922152,2013-06-02,6091151,Rachel,"I stayed here for about 3 weeks and it was great! The room was very comfortable and quiet and I loved the neighborhood. The streets are beautiful and so much fun to explore. The bus is only about a 3 minute walk away. There's also several great coffee shops and restaurants which Sheldon was nice enough to direct me to when I arrived. In addition to being a very kind host, he was also a great resource to learn about the city and surrounding areas. I would definitely recommend this room! "
370361,5044416,2013-06-09,6663794,Dieter,"Had a great time Sheldon's, his accommodations are very comfortable and his location is great, great restaurants, ""Prost pub""  is a must, it's near bus stops, green lake and red mill burger (man vs food)  are all within walking distance, plus  its close to down town. My wife loved the private entrance."
370361,5183205,2013-06-17,4888564,Aina Nadia,I rented this place for my parents while they were in town and we really like the place. It is very clean and just as shown in the pictures. Having a private door entry is really convenient and allows us to come and leave whenever we want t without feeling like we are interrupting the home owner. The neighborhood is quite and lovely. Mr. Sheldon is especially helpful and friendly. He checked on us and made sure that we are comfortable and provided us with other small requests we needed. He is also very responsive with any inquiries.
370361,5274661,2013-06-22,5856450,Jennifer,"Sheldon was a wonderful host, his space is perfect in terms of location, set up, and comfort, and overall this will be a place we will definitely stay at again for our next trip to Seattle. My husband and I stayed there with our two year old and we had a lovely visit. "
370361,5372146,2013-06-26,6336004,Kelli,"Sheldon was a fantastic host, and he made himself available for tips about great places to see in Seattle! The room was neat, clean, and very comfortable, perfect for our three-day stay! His home is in a great neighborhood, and we loved the private entrance. We'd recommend him to anyone staying in the Seattle area!"
370361,5524642,2013-07-04,1619776,Elizabeth,"My parents had a great stay at Sheldon's. They were close by, it was quite, and the apartment was very walkable to good coffee and restaurants. Sheldon was very friendly and helpful. "
370361,5732192,2013-07-14,6532581,Finbar,"Sheldon's place is pristine and quiet. Sheldon was helpful and friendly at all times. I love the neighborhood... everything you need within a few blocks and right of bus route downtown. Also convenient to areas of Greenlake, Fremont and Ballard. "
370361,5864720,2013-07-20,6705526,Sara,"We had a great time and the room was just what we needed. Sheldon is a gracious (and quiet!) host, he made sure to check in on us unobtrusively throughout the week we were there. The bed was most comfy so it really was a great resting place for us during our busy visit. Sheldon even played tour consultant by providing some great ideas for places to go. I highly recommend the room and the host! Thanks!"
370361,5943611,2013-07-23,6647417,Kris,"I loved my stay at this private unit.  The room was beautiful very clean and had everything I needed. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Great neighborhood, lots of restaurants and shops nearby.   Sheldon was very welcoming and strives to give you the right amount of attention, depending on your needs.  I was in town for my 40th high school reunion, and know Seattle quite well so did not need much any tourist information.   I will stay here again if the unit is available.  

The only thing I was nervous about before my stay was the on-street parking. The area is somewhat hilly and I am not a good parallel Parker.   I had no problem parking at all, and the only time I was unable to park right in front of the unit was my last night.  The house sits on a corner and the street running north- south is flat. 

I highly recommend this guest studio."
370361,6049822,2013-07-28,6933319,Shelley,"Check-in was effortless...Sheldon was there to greet us.  He provided us with suggestions of where to eat, shop, sight-see, all within easy reach of his place.  That was great because Seattle traffic means getting from point A to point B can be time-consuming. The area where Sheldon's place is at, is easy to get to.  A couple of major routes get you right ""downtown"" for all the ""touristy"" things to do while in Seattle, and he's pretty close to a major shopping centre if that's what you want as well. Would we stay at Sheldon's next time we head to Seattle?  You bet!  It was everything we needed."
370361,6711855,2013-08-22,6965370,Mick,"Sheldon was a fantastic host! We truly enjoyed the special touches such as fresh cut flowers and fresh picked cherry tomatoes from his garden. The room is just as advertised including all the necessary amenities but the experience was even better. If you're looking for a place to stay in the Phinney Ridge area of Seattle, this is that place. Thanks a lot Sheldon! See you next year."
370361,6890095,2013-08-29,6408900,Cherie,"Our stay at Sheldon's place in Greenwood was pretty much perfect. The room is perfect as a launching/crashing pad for jaunts to Ballard, Greenlake, Golden Gardens, the U District and even downtown (buses regularly leave from just a block or so away). Sheldon greeted us as we arrived, noting the details of the place and surrounds and offered little delights, like delicious fresh tomatoes and a vase of fresh flowers waiting for us upon arrival. He repeatedly offered to do anything to make our stay more comfortable. I'd definitely recommend staying here and with Sheldon. "
370361,7115398,2013-09-07,4965820,Aran,"My parents stayed at Sheldon's place while in town visiting from the East Coast. They loved it. They said it was very clean, and loved that there was a little porch to sit on and drink their coffee in the morning. There are lots of places in walking distance to eat, and the room was cozy and quiet. Sheldon was a great host. "
370361,7291158,2013-09-14,2520312,Sarah,The room was clean and sleek. The host was very nice he explained well and it seemed. I enjoyed the stay. Thanks! 
370361,7392696,2013-09-18,3191033,Leslie,"Sheldon's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle as it was close to our daughter's place and we could easily walk back and forth.  Sheldon met us when we arrived and showed us the space which was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  We were pleased with the comfort of the room, how quiet the neighborhood was, and delighted with the gift of some cherry tomatoes which were left on the table outside our door.  Thank you, Sheldon.  "
370361,7489989,2013-09-22,8531683,William,"My friend and I had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed our stay at Sheldon's place!  His Phinney Ridge guest house is in a great location, very clean and private.  I highly recommend it!"
370361,7579582,2013-09-25,921369,Rick,"Sheldon's studio is a wonderful place for us to stay when in Seattle. It's convenient to shopping, dining, transportation and other things we like to do while there and it's always spotlessly clean. Sheldon is an interesting and gracious host. We highly recommend this place!"
370361,7812356,2013-10-04,8157983,Janet,"What a wonderful experience for our ""first"" with Airbnb!!  Studio was clean, well-appointed, cozy, comfortable, and in a very quite neighborhood!!  The location is especially nice since it's close to several coffee shops, an ale house, and food sources.  This is a real find for us as a great home away from home when we visit our daughter in Seattle.  Sheldon, who met us at the door late at night, was most accommodating {he made sure we could operate the security system and the shower :- )! },  and we look forward to many return visits to his studio!"
370361,7917535,2013-10-08,8152252,Teresa,"Sheldon has thought of everything! This gracious host provides an umbrella for those unpredictable Seattle days, a flashlight by the bed, a night light and a power bar to charge all the electronics as well as his happy smile and yummy tomato snacks in season.  The room is sparkling clean and welcoming!  I will definitely return to this easy to reach place in an absolutely charming neighborhood.  I love the little lending library just down the block!"
370361,8263105,2013-10-22,3567820,Jay,"Great experience! The room was small and exactly what we needed, a place to have a cup of coffee on the porch, or in the room. Plenty of room for the two of us to have a home base for when we weren't out exploring. We loved the new restaurants and coffee shops popping up in Ballard, and the morning walks to them from Sheldon's place, were immaculate! Incredible greenery and nice and quiet the entire day.  If we're ever in Seattle again, we will absolutely stay at Sheldon's. "
370361,8361650,2013-10-27,9600525,John,"We stayed in the guest studio for three nights (Oct. 23-25) and found it to be great for our requirements. Nice clean, secure, good location, etc. we would go back and /or refer to friends and family.
"
370361,8439136,2013-10-30,9595910,Kristana,Went without a hitch.  Pleasant room completely private.  Why would anyone pay more to stay in a hotel?
370361,8585754,2013-11-06,9125913,Deborah A.,"The Phinney Ridge studio was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced.  Sheldon was the perfect host, with attention to our needs and knowledge of the area.  We hope to stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.  Thank you, Sheldon!"
370361,8661224,2013-11-11,9327403,Kacy,Sheldon's guest studio was so wonderful!  We enjoyed our stay immensely.  Sheldon was kind and extremely helpful.  We loved having a private entrance so that we could come and go as we pleased.  The Phinney Ridge/Greenwood area was far and away one of our favorite places in Seattle--there's several really great places within walking distance of Sheldon's home.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
370361,8797809,2013-11-18,3039949,Laura,"Everything was as described.  All my needs were met by Sheldon's attention to detail but I was sure that if something were lacking it would have been quickly remedied.

Great neighborhood in which to stay!"
370361,9158901,2013-12-10,8607244,Kathleen,"The Phinney Ridge studio is a perfect location for our needs. It is a quiet corner, near Greenwood Avenue, close to our family. Sheldon is a gracious host; all our needs were met and we definitely would return. "
370361,9255547,2013-12-16,5112714,Joyce,"This was a clean and pleasant place to stay. It had enough
space, privacy, and the microwave and refrigerator made it
easy to heat up some food. Very quiet neighborhood. Host gave
me the needed orientation and then respected my privacy. I
would definitely consider staying there again."
370361,9927485,2014-01-20,6983287,Leeann,"We had a great stay at Sheldon's.  The room was very clean and comfortable and set up in a convenient way.  Sheldon was very helpful during check-in, and gave us tips about local restaurants.

It is also close to the bus line if you need to venture into downtown Seattle.
We would not hesitate to stay at Sheldon's again."

Loved the heated towel rack!"
370361,11307698,2014-03-29,12599677,Raven,"Sheldon is a friendly host, he insist to meet me face to face, make sure everything in the house works for me. Sheldon also gave me advice for visiting Seattle and make sure I stay away from dangerous area.
About the studio, it is a excellent place to stay, not only clean, cozy, private and convience, it has details in every setting such as bookself, closet , funitures , I really love this place and enjoyed my staying, I would stay here again if I will visit seattle again! Thanks again Sheldon!"
370361,11460812,2014-04-03,7843321,Shane,Exactly as described.  Clean tidy studio and Sheldon was a super nice man.  Highly recommended.
370361,11825317,2014-04-16,10834069,Jd,"I would rent this again.
Sheldon is easy to deal with.
Access - private entrance
Layout - 1 room plus full bathroom.
Size - good fit for my wife and I, not suggested for adult with child or family.
Comfort - clean, simple and nice space.
Noise - quiet with occasional car noise, no noise from upstairs, fridge makes occasional noise after door has been opened.
Natural lighting - on street level so we often kept the blinds shut."
370361,12656398,2014-05-07,12882524,Rebecca,"The room was beautiful, the bathroom clean, and the bed comfortable!  The location was fantastic - a very short walk to bookshops, a yarn shop, coffee shops and restaurants.  And in a beautiful neighborhood!

We enjoyed chatting with Sheldon about his garden and learning more about the local area. The cable TV and wireless Internet were really nice amenities.

If we're ever in Seattle again, I would definitely stay here again!"
370361,12951016,2014-05-15,13960157,Marilyn,Sheldon was a very nice person and the space was great.  The neighborhood very quiet and peaceful.  Great place to stay.  Would stay again.

370361,13430706,2014-05-27,14727369,Princess,"What an amazing place to stay!!! The area is beautiful and perfect. So glad we didn't stay around downtown somewhere. The bed was sooo comfortable and pillows were amazing! My husband is making me ask Sheldon where he purchased them. Haha

The room was very clean and cozy. 
I'm not sure if Sheldon had the a/c or heat on but he did have a window open when we arrived. I would recommend opening both windows though if you like to sleep in a cool room. When we only had the one small window open it was quite warm when we arrived back that night (and it was probably 60 degrees out). Once we opened the bigger window though it was the perfect temperature. Obviously check with Sheldon though to make sure his a/c or heat isn't running. We just figured since the window was open when we got there that it was off. It ended up being great!

We wouldn't change a thing about our stay. Sheldon was so nice and great to talk to. :)"
370361,13814100,2014-06-05,11946087,Ashwin,"If anyone is looking for a private stay in a comfortable room with amenities such as high def cable TV and close to downtown (15 minutes by car), I would recommend that they consider Sheldon's place for their stay. Everything is convenient and close by. Sheldon is very helpful if you need anything. "
370361,14266862,2014-06-16,12570905,Sue,Great accomodations.  We especially appreciated the separate entrance since our comings and goings were at odd hours.  Phinney Ridge is a great location and it was nice to be part of a local neighborhood.  Sheldon is very helpful.
370361,14703598,2014-06-24,16092785,James,"Fully met our expectations.  Convenient location, nice neighborhood, adequate street parking, very comfortable bed, very clean.  Reasonably priced.  Sheldon was very helpful and accommodating without imposing.  Would definitely stay here again."

The room was very clean and nicely decorated.  The private bathroom and entrance were a big plus!  It is located in a great little neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants only a short walk away.  We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting Seattle and staying with Sheldon again.
370361,15219639,2014-07-05,3202893,Finn,"My wife and I stayed here and had a wonderful time. The place has a great location with many nice restaurants, grocery stores, and bus lines within walking distance. Sheldon was very nice and the place is great inside. We would definitely stay here again! "
370361,15395977,2014-07-08,14600940,Phyllis,"Sheldon was a great host!  He met me upon my arrival and explained all the features of this very comfortable studio in his home.  The room was clean, neat and had all the features you could want; TV, microwave, coffee pot, fridge, etc.  The location is perfect if you want to be in a friendly, vibrant neighborhood North of downtown Seattle.  There is a local grocery very close by as well as coffee shops, restaurants and local bars.  
"
370361,16302816,2014-07-25,16757197,Jeri,"Our host, Sheldon, met us at his doorway and walked us around to the studio. He is friendly and outgoing. The studio is just as described. Very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood is in a  great Seattle area with plenty of restaurants, pubs and shops etc. We were visiting our daughters and granddaughter so spent most of our time out and about Seattle this studio location made it so easy to get back and forth.  We would definitely recommend and will likely return for future  visits. "
370361,16546096,2014-07-29,1555854,Ruth And Jay,"Sheldon's place was perfect! Perfect location and perfect set up with the private entrance, bathroom, and patio! We will absolutely stay again when we visit Seattle."
370361,16821301,2014-08-03,12775996,Teresa,"I met my sister and her two kids in Seattle for four days of sightseeing. She paid $350 a night for a Courtyard Marriott; I paid a fraction of that for a comfortable bed in a clean, well-furnished room in a charming neighborhood. How awesome is that?

The guest studio is exactly as described and pictured. I am a clean freak, but there is not one single thing I can pick on in that area.  I was happy to trade the malodorous, high-traffic carpet of a typical hotel for the clean wood floors of this guest room. I slept comfortably every night and showered in a clean tub. Sheldon himself is a congenial host. He was polite and accessible and respectful of my privacy. The overall personalized attention you get from Sheldon beats the indifference of a hotel any day. Indeed, he scrupulously attended to my comfort and safety.

I came to Seattle to tour the city and do some hiking in the nearby Cascades, but Sheldon's neighborhood turned out to be an attraction in itself. I was charmed by the architecture of the homes, the friendly small businesses, and the overall tranquility. Negotiating the distance between Phinney Ridge and downtown Seattle was a cinch. Here's what you do: get yourself a hearty breakfast at Pete's Eggnest, walk four steps to the bus stop, and get on the #5 bus. Fifteen minutes later you're in the city center. It's as easy as that.

Take my advice. Save your money (you'll need it for the exorbitant price of admission for all the attractions). Rather than feed your hard-earned dollars to the hotel-chain sharks, support the endeavors of this Everyman. Sheldon will take good care of you."
370361,17047494,2014-08-06,16457874,Nicholas,Wonderful and quiet room in a fantastic neighborhood. Sheldon keeps the place spotless which is really nice. We would stay there again!
370361,17333397,2014-08-11,1998493,Roy,Sheldon was at the location to greet us and he was very cordial.This was our first stay through Airbnb and it was very good.Sheldon was very helpful about attractions to visit and getting around the Seattle area.I would recommend staying at this location for anyone visiting the Seattle area.P.S.there is a great German pub on Greenwood Ave. just a five minute from Sheldons studio.
370361,19454942,2014-09-13,14043252,Corie,"Our first experience using airbnb could not have been easier! This was our first visit to Seattle and the Northwest and it was to see our son & daughter-in-law who moved there last summer and for us, the studio and its location worked out extremely well! Everything about it was exactly as shown and described and Sheldon was very helpful and responsive. We definitely recommend it and hope to return for future visits."
370361,19789429,2014-09-18,13740672,Phil,Sheldon was courteous and made sure I was settled and had everything I needed and was flexible with my check-in. Great neighborhood and the room was as advertised and very clean and nicely arranged. Very quiet for sleeping.
370361,20019890,2014-09-22,3707444,Jon,"We loved staying in Sheldon's private guest studio. The room was well appointed, immaculately clean, very private (with its own entrance) and had everything we required for a wonderful stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, and it makes a great home base to enjoy the city. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!

"
370361,20687753,2014-10-04,16735009,Ashleigh,"Fantastic, quiet neighborhood and half way to everything great Seattle had to offer. Close to public transport. The room was absolutely beautiful, very clean and equipped with everything I could need. Loved my time here!"
370361,20997306,2014-10-09,196121,Ken,We had a very pleasant stay and found the location perfect to explore the area and visit family. Sheldon is a great host with lots of info about the area and places to visit. We enjoyed our stay.
370361,21761746,2014-10-23,3560810,Sonja,"Like the other reviews say, this studio is exactly as listed. It's beautiful and quiet. I loved the hot towel warmer, what a treat! Sheldon was very helpful with check in and check out. I'll definitely be back to stay. "
370361,22722383,2014-11-12,23316381,Sandra,"Staying at Sheldon's was awesome. The description of the place was spot on, clean and cozy.  Bed was super comfy, private entrance was great. Awesome amenities, TV, mini fridge, and heated towel rack because who doesn't appreciate a warm towel! Had everything I needed and than some. Was flexible with check in time. Convenient location! Would definitely stay here again!"
370361,23219850,2014-11-25,23437122,Larry,"Sheldon is a great host.  The accommodations are exactly as pictured and described.  The bed i very comfortable. One nice feature is the location is easy walking distance to restaurants, shops and bars, yet a very quiet neighborhood. Love Seattle!  I would defiantly rent this space again. Highly recommend!s "
370361,23392184,2014-11-30,12432466,Liz,"We spent Thanksgiving week in Sheldon's comfortable space. Sheldon was very friendly and got us settled in the first night and checked with us via text during the next day to make sure we had been comfortable. The room was just right for our purpose. We had a warm, quiet spot to sleep and spent the balance of the time with family. The room has it's own entrance to the house so we didn't feel like we were bothering Sheldon getting in late in the evening. The house is in a great location and we could walk to get coffee and breakfast in the morning. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint, the room clean and comfortable and Sheldon is a great host. Highly recommended AirBB."
370361,23877151,2014-12-13,24346864,Michael,"This is my first review on airbnb, and my first stay under my own account on airbnb. And I have to say that the stay could not have been more perfect. Sheldon has thought of everything. The room was nice and cozy, and Sheldon was very warm and hospitable host.

First the room. It was the perfect size and fit for my girlfriend and I. The bed was very comfortable, there was a TV with cable on it, wifi worked, and the lock on our door had a passcode so we didnt need a key. Everything was very clean and nice, and the back door (which was the entrance to our room), made us feel like we had our own home away from home. There were glasses in the room with a mini fridge, and also a microwave. The room temp automatically adjusted, so we never had to fidget with it. Sheldon literally thought of everything!

As for Sheldon, like I said he was a very hospitable host. Very welcoming and knowledgeable of the area. But he also gave us our own privacy, and only texting me to make sure everything was comfortable or if I needed anything. I would definitely try and book with Sheldon in the future!

Seriously, do yourself a favor and book with Sheldon. This was way better than a hotel, with our own privacy but also much quieter and more comfortable."
370361,24022001,2014-12-17,13003932,Estelle,"Host was very gracious and met me when I arrived somewhat late on the evening of the reservation. The studio was immaculate and furnishings quite attractive. After spending one night, I was delighted by the bed being superb. The location couldn't have been better as I could walk to my family's home quite comfortably. "
370361,25340829,2015-01-12,6165790,Steven,"Sheldon provided a fantastic space that was warm, clean and inviting. His room in Phinney Ridge is near everything: coffee shops, restaurants, Greenlake. Sheldon was very communicative, checking in on us periodically to make sure our stay was going well. We had a great time. "
370361,26115945,2015-02-03,26382867,Martin,"A very good stay, in a very nice room with a very nice host. Thank you Sheldon"
370361,26776904,2015-02-19,24675914,Nancy,"Sheldon was very welcoming and helpful in explaining how the guest room worked and answering any questions we had. We love the neighborhood: our son lives there and over the years we have gotten to know the area and appreciate all that is available.
"
370361,27502319,2015-03-06,27338623,Leonard (Lenny),"Great location; convenient, quiet neighborhood, available street parking.  Easy private access with key-pad lock.  Our host was very responsive, welcoming, and a pleasant fellow.  Bed was comfortable, and the room was clean.  Everything worked.  We will definitely stay again if we need a room and this is available.  "
370361,28471169,2015-03-24,27181023,Jeff,"Sheldon offers a lovely and very comfortable space in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood of Seattle. It's a quick 5 minute walk to a direct bus line into downtown, as well as some great restaurants, coffee, and food markets. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning!"
370361,28897345,2015-03-31,1435222,Dutch,"Outstanding Place!  Sheldon was a fantastic host!  This place looks EXACTLY how it does in the pictures.  Very private, etc.

Everything worked. Bed was comfortable. Everything was very clean. It even had a towel warmer (Bonus!).  WiFi, Cable TV, Sheldon stocked coffee, extra shampoo, extra towels... even supplied popcorn (I LOVE popcorn).

Quiet neighborhood, easy access, parking is no problem, stores restaurants and bars are all within walking distance, quick access to freeway.

Great place!  Nothing missing!  All details were accounted for!

I would love to stay here on EVERY trip to Seattle!

Nice work, Sheldon!  It was a pleasure staying with you."
370361,29129650,2015-04-04,29577691,Jennifer,We enjoyed our visit to Seattle and Sheldon's apartment was very nice and in a convenient location.  The neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  The bus to downtown is just a block away.  Sheldon is a gracious host and was very helpful with information about local attractions.  Very clean.  Thanks again!
370361,30075739,2015-04-17,9144576,Kevin,"Sheldon was great, the space was setup, clean and ready for us.  He met us and explained how to use the lock and details for the space.

Would happily recommend Sheldon's Studio!"
370361,30410338,2015-04-21,4635972,Felicia,"Sheldon was very helpful. His place was clean and in a fantastic neighborhood. Easy to walk to the bus with great food and drink nearby too. He was accommodating, allowing us to leave our bags early before check in and allowing us to have a late check out. There were also some supplies for making food in room which was convenient. I will definitely stay again when I am back to visit Seattle. Thanks Sheldon!"
370361,31042267,2015-05-01,7100136,Barbara,"Sheldon was a great host, meeting me at our arranged time and explaining how everything worked in the studio, including the TV and wifi.  The location is in a wonderful neighborhood, very quiet with lots of trees, but only a block from a major street with bus connections and (my favorite) the Sip & Ship Center, which combines espresso and mail.  Do be aware that the cooking arrangements consist of a microwave and a coffeemaker, without a real kitchen sink.  So plan on sampling some of Seattle's wonderful restaurants while you are visiting."
370361,35544548,2015-06-20,28015693,Carolyn,"Sheldon's private room is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood with easy access to shops, businesses and restaurants. Sheldon was gracious, very accommodating and showed interest in getting to know us. He suggested activities and outings in the Seattle area and was always available when we had questions or concerns."
370361,36652487,2015-06-30,27715703,Alicia,"We had a great stay at Sheldon's these past 10 days. The studio was located in a prime area of the city. A beautiful neighborhood full of shops and eateries with extremely easy one bus access to downtown. 
The room was of perfect size and with the necessary amenities one needs for an extended stay. The room was clean, bright and airy. Sheldon was a text away always and he always had an answer to any question we had. He was also very helpful with the fact that he knew of all the activities and festivals going on, in and around the city and surrounding area during the time we were there.
We highly recommend Sheldon's as a top pick to anyone looking for a perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle and it's surrounding attractions. 
"
370361,37783307,2015-07-10,5569785,Bessie & Bill,"This is a delightful room with a private entrance and very pleasant tiny patio in a great neighborhood.  It is one block from a frequent bus to downtown.  There are 2 good grocery stores nearby, several restaurants including a great Thai one. A good coffee shop.  Sheldon had anticipated most needs and was extremely responsive to our requests.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, walking the neighborhood was very pleasant.  It gave us a good taste of what living in Seattle might be like.  Public transportation works well and Uber provided a quick, cheaper lift to downtown than taking a taxi when we needed to catch an early ferry."
370361,38163523,2015-07-13,35813386,Cassie,"This was a great place to stay. Check in was a breeze and I loved the key code lock feature on the door. The room was immaculate and nicely decorated. We had everything we could have possibly needed. Our host took time one of our mornings to give us a tour of his beautiful garden and show us the many varieties of heirloom tomatoes he has. Although we were well familiar with the area we were staying in as we'd grown up there, it was very clear that if we'd needed suggestions or help figuring out what to do or where to go our host would be a great resource. 
This was our first airbnb experience and it was a great one. We would definitely stay again. "
370361,39529980,2015-07-24,14414948,JoAnn,"This was our second AirBnb experience which did not start with Sheldon but fortunately for us lead to his listing. What a delightful stay!
The suite was exactly like photographed only better. ..immaculately clean, tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable. We both loved the private patio and it's lovely plants...just like home.
The private entrance was also very convenient as was the in room bath,mini kitchen items and tv. All was perfect...and then there was Sheldon who could not be more inviting. He shared the fruits of his garden and it was delicious. If Seattle is on our list again, we will definitely go back to Phinney Ridge. BTW...what a great area...block from coffee shops,restaurants and a Tibetian temple I visited everyday just because of the prayer wheels.
This was a lovely memory of Seattle."
370361,40677304,2015-08-01,39494096,Jacob,"Sheldon is very accommodating and a great host!  The space was ideal and felt like home - very comfortable, quiet, and peaceful.  I slept like I was on vacation.  We could not ask for a better experience."
370361,41344270,2015-08-07,28777812,Richard,"My wife and I had a great experience at Sheldon's place. The space was very clean and comfortable, and had more than enough room for the both of us. The neighborhood was very quiet and we sat on the very private patio several times. Yet we were within a couple of blocks of great coffee shops and restaurants , even an ice cream shop. Bus stop one block away makes it easy to get almost anywhere. Sheldon was a super host and was available for any information if needed, also provided us with several of his fresh tomatoes ! Would surely return here for future visits.    Rick and Marylou"
370361,43504703,2015-08-20,35767707,Jens,"Using Airbnb for the first time, we were very excited to see how it would work for us. When we arrived at Sheldon’s place, he met us with open arms. His hospitality and kindness made us feel at home right away.  The room we stayed in had the facilities we needed for our stay and it was clean and spacious. To have access to a clean bathroom with a shower after our long city walks in the hot summer in Seattle, was greatly appreciated. 
Sheldon and I share an appetite for tomatoes, but tasting his own home-grown tomatoes of different sorts was just an amazing experience. 
Sheldon shared his knowledge about Seattle and Washington and thereby helped us plan exciting trips in the area. Especially the trip to Mt. Rainier and the national park, recommended by Sheldon, will be remembered. Walking amongst the thousand years old and very large trees in the Grove of the Patriarchs, made a huge impression on both my wife and I. We are very pleased with our stay at Sheldon’s house and we want to recommend others to visit his place, located as it is in quiet surroundings. We hope to come back here again next time we visit Seattle.
"
370361,49994101,2015-10-08,5606936,Andres,"Sheldon is a great host!  I was relocating to Seattle and stayed in his place for a month.  Sheldon was very accommodating, the place is very nice, clean and conveniently located near coffee shops with quick access to the bus.   Sheldon treated me to some of his tasty tomatoes from his garden and gave me great insight about Seattle.  I highly recommend Sheldon as a host and will definitely refer friends and relatives to stay in his place who are visiting or relocating to Seattle.      "
370361,52336513,2015-10-28,45204353,Reuben,"Sheldon was a great host  and checked with me many times during my stay to be sure I had all that I needed.  The listing description was very accurate and the room was very clean and comfortable.  
The neighborhood was very quiet and safe.  I enjoyed sitting on the private patio.  Everything that I needed was within walking distance."
370361,57491013,2015-12-26,8595438,Seth,"Staying at Sheldon's place was perfect in every respect. He communicated quickly to confirm all details and checked in to make sure my stay was comfortable. His place is a perfect private studio for two - warm and modern - for a quiet neighborhood stay in Phinney-Greenwood, which has many good restaurants, coffee shops, and a supermarket to walk to within 10-15 minutes. And Sheldon was very helpful about pointing me in the right direction!"
3522409,46744913,2015-09-13,29032279,Claudia,"Quarky Lillie was all we could have hoped for to get a unique Seattle Experience. The boat has been beautifully restored and provides all the creature comforts needed, including an awesome shower setup. 
Mike was a great host, was going and relaxed but always there when we needed him. He left kayaks with the boat - so awesome!! "
3522409,46854550,2015-09-13,1678674,Kendra,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3522409,47774239,2015-09-21,36387796,Benjamin,"Micheal was very responsive. My flight arrived late in the evening, but he was quick to message me back and give me very specific directions on where to find the key, how to work the toilet and stove, and gave us full use of the kayaks.

We were very happy with the location and there's nothing like waking up and having a cup of coffee on the bow with the sun rising. Great spot! Great Experience"
3522409,47846421,2015-09-21,42872958,William,"The accommodations were really fantastic. Great, really cool boat, very comfortable living space, excellent view, and wonderful location. Really ideal for spending some quiet time in Seattle without sacrificing accessibility."
3522409,48108361,2015-09-23,43021043,Lisa,"Adorable, we loved!"
3522409,48209756,2015-09-24,30596566,Ashlee,"Check-in was smooth, and the boat was absolutely adorable. "
3522409,48366243,2015-09-25,26131064,Ji,"It was my first visit to Seattle and I wanted to make it a special one. The houseboat was definitely one of the most unique experience I have ever had, and I really enjoyed the stay. The place was a bit dusty but even with a dust allergy, I was fine during the stay. I would definitely recommend it to a friend who is looking for an authentic experience in Seattle! "
3522409,48463280,2015-09-26,4351222,Samantha,"Beautiful boat, great location- close to downtown. Really great stay- couldn't recommend this place more!"
3522409,49493725,2015-10-04,8303643,Carolyn,This place is truly exceptional. Beautiful space - unique - and in a central location. Stay here if you have the opportunity!
3522409,49846963,2015-10-06,22800104,Scott,"We had a great stay: Michael met us at check in, and made himself available if anything came up. The boat is just as described-- I highly recommend it if available. Parking was just as described, a few minutes walk. Great spot, great host-- thank you Michael!"
3522409,50125736,2015-10-09,728883,Guillermo,"Great place, everything is as described in the listing. The place is quite, it doesn't move too much. I really enjoyed using Michael's kayak for a morning paddle. "
3522409,50194225,2015-10-10,1149939,Derek,"Michael's houseboat was absolutely fantastic and he was accommodating in every way- with great directions for my very late arrival as well. I've stayed in many tiny houses, tree houses, and houseboats around the US, and his is one of the nicer ones I've had the pleasure to overnight in. I'd stay in this houseboat again in a heartbeat. "
3522409,50533933,2015-10-12,23779817,Carol,"We had a very pleasing time at the Quarky Lillie Houseboat. It was the highlight of our visit. The houseboat was comfortable, clean and all of the equipment worked as advertised. We arrived after dark and were able to find the boat easily. Perfect location easy to get around the city. Nice run this morning around south end of Lake Union. Would come back."
3522409,50815403,2015-10-14,5028980,Joshua,"This is such a cool lodging experience.  I would highly recommend it.  The area the boat is in is close to everything.  The boat itself is very cool and the bed is really comfortable.  Also, the host Michael is great.  He has everything listed very clearly on how to work everything so your stay goes smoothly.  And best of all are the kayaks....make sure and take advantage of them.  "
3522409,50979907,2015-10-16,31337991,Jesse,"Lillie made for a perfect experience this past week. The houseboat is a nice quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city around lake Union. It's a bit cooler down on the water this time of year, but the deck and roof were perfect for sitting on and watching the sunrise and sunset. Michael was excellent to work with and made check in and check out smooth and on our own schedule. We will definitely be back!"
3522409,51156396,2015-10-18,44125756,Jonathan,The place is fantastic. Would totally stay there again.
3522409,51923701,2015-10-25,4262655,Erin,We had a great time staying on Michael's houseboat. The space is adorable and cozy! We were very impressed and would highly recommend staying here for a one of a kind experience. We were able to walk/bike to everywhere we wanted to go around Seattle.
3522409,52258668,2015-10-27,6893173,Ian,Michael's houseboat was so badass!!! We could not have anticipated how cool this place was! The place feels so much bigger than it looks in the pictures. It was chilly outside and the boat felt like a warm cabin! We got some good weather and took the kayaks out for a beautiful night on the lake. I can't wait to go back to Seattle so we can chill in the boat again!
3522409,52421093,2015-10-29,10770470,Cassie,"This was me and my boyfriend Alex's first vacation together.  The Quarky Lillie Houseboat is what made our trip special!  We did a lot around Seattle, but we were so eager to go hang out on the houseboat!  It had everything we needed, is incredibly unique and surprisingly comfortable.  The marina was quiet and easy to find, and the people in the area were all friendly.  Uber drivers are familiar with the marina, so it was easy to catch a ride!  I would do it again in a heartbeat!"
3522409,52889956,2015-11-02,2166301,Hellen,"Our stay on the Lillie was really too good. We hunkered down during a rainy three days and the boat was incredibly peaceful, spacious, well-lit. The gentle rocking of the boat during the storms was actually very calming. Michael was SUPER friendly, greeting us after we arrived, and chillin' nearby with his cool dog for neighborly chats and advice.  The toilet was a little temperamental but Michael was very responsive to our nervous text messages, and we got the hang of it soon. The land toilets were also fine! The Japanese tub/shower was AMAZING, and the hobbit-hole soft bed was BEYOND AMAZING. Thanks Michael for such a relaxing stay!!!"
3522409,54117875,2015-11-16,25401910,Charmaine,Lillie did not disappoint us. The interior's really cuuute. It's been raining most days of our trip but it didn't bother our stay at all. Mike's been very helpful and friendly too! If you like unique places to stay then you'll surely fall in love with Lillie :) 
3522409,54993409,2015-11-27,7757139,Ali,"The Lillie is a beautiful little boat, beautifully restored and furnished, clean and cozy. It was just a dream come true to stay on a houseboat and we loved it. The marina is quiet and the bed is really comfortable. We had four people - two adults and our two teenagers - and whilst the Lillie is really ideal for two people, four worked for us as we are used to close quarters and packing light. We did not meet Michael as he was out of town, but we loved the piece of sockeye salmon he had left for us. "
3522409,55536319,2015-12-01,3676656,Jaime,We had a delightful winter stay with Micheal and were lucky enough to tour both of his house boat accommodations. It was a real bucket list treat to stay at on a house boat and Michaels attention to detail in design and comfort made it a success.
3522409,55806256,2015-12-06,13338497,Sydney,"We had a wonderful evening on Lillie! It's was such a unique and fun experience staying on a houseboat. Lillie was clean, comfy, and had everything we needed. We only stayed one night so we didn't get to meet Michael but he was very responsive through email and text. We would definitely go back for longer next time and recommended it to anyone. "
3522409,56230498,2015-12-10,23987415,Gary,"Wow! What a cool experience. My only regret is experiencing this spot while I was on a solo trip. The boat is in a great area and there is a great little convenient   store right there for beer, water and really good sandwiches. The bed in the boat is the most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in and there was a nice selection of books to check out while relaxing. I woke up early and hit the market to get all fresh ingredients to make breakfast which was nice. The host was great and getting entry to the spot was really easy. I would definitely recommend staying for at least two nights. I look forward to staying here again one day but for more then one night.  "
3522409,56571360,2015-12-14,29127664,Mary,We had a fabulous time.  Photos were on point.  Michael was a responsive host.  It was a beautiful and intimate space.  We would definitely return.
3522409,56872844,2015-12-19,11933220,Thomas,"Airbnb keeps nagging for a review so here is my review. Booked owner's other houseboat on 12/2 for the night of 12/19 (17 days notice). Date green-lit, all systems go. 11 days later, received a notice from owner on 12/13 (6 days to arrival) telling me the original houseboat was actually not available for the date confirmed. As an alternative was offered this houseboat a day early (reducing the notice to 5 days).   Due to my schedule this was the only option and proceeded. The difference reimbursed.

Owner not there to greet, left opened food and fish in refrigerator which created a pungent stench upon opening. Luckily the $90/bottle of Brut was new and unable to soak up the aroma of the 'curing' fish.  Not sure the boat was prepped fully. The toilet tank possibly not emptied because after a couple uses on my 1 night stay it failed to flush (water/urnine go down). Due to this and heating inefficiencies (I understand, it's a boat)-- I checked out at 8am the next morning.

Thankfully what was potentially making for a hurdle of a night, proposing to my girlfriend of 7 years that night (on the boat) was a success, she said yes. We attempted to take a picture of the ring (obligatory social network engagement photo) using the house provided Japanese Polaroid camera that was left for guests and for the purpose of documenting memories on the boat, said there were 7 shots remaining to which guests were allocated 2 photos due to the cost of the film (which I completely understand because the film is spendy-- I have a nearly identical camera from my travels to Japan, however mine was the chocolate bar version if that makes any difference). Either way, fired off 2 shots and nothing coming up, knowing that the camera is likely out of film, opened it up and sure enough. Completely empty but still showing 5 photos remaining, bummer. The moment unfortunately not documented for the boat and future guests, which might have been cool."
3522409,57264567,2015-12-23,10762730,Majdi,Michael was a great host and it was such a wonderful experience staying on the houseboat. It was the middle of winter and the boat still felt warm. Fully recommend it if you're visiting Seattle! 
3522409,57593262,2015-12-27,51590436,Christine,Everything was great! The boat was exactly what we expected it to be and it was such a perfect experience for a few of us spending a night out of town. Michael always made sure we knew we could call him if we ever needed anything. We didn't though because it was perfect just the way it was! Thank you Michael!
1609922,8062466,2013-10-14,9168947,Claire,"We LOVED staying at Katie's house!!! It is so adorable and impeccably clean. Katie and Dan were such warm hosts- they left us local beer and some snacks! And they gave us some helpful info about the neighborhood, which is fantastic with many restaurants, bars, and really cute shops. 

Every room of the house is great, and we especially loved that the living room has a fireplace and record player which we were welcomed to use. We took advantage of that and had an amazing Washington experience. I'd definitely recommend this booking!!"
1609922,9016519,2013-12-02,335998,Kate,"We had a great stay at Katie and Dan's apartment over Thanksgiving holiday.  The beds were cozy, the kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary gadgets, and the location was perfect.  Just a five minute walk to the heart of Ballard, and right across the street from the Ballard Market, key in last minute food pick-ups.  

Our only gripe was there was a condo construction site directly next door.  Construction began promptly at 7am every morning, making it impossible to get some extra sleep-in time on our vacation.  

I would definitely stay here again.  "
1609922,11387075,2014-03-31,11410669,Shannon,"Katie's place was in a fantastic location close to shops, great restaurants in Ballard and only a short distance to Freemont. 
The house was very cosy with everything we needed
As mentioned in the description, parking is a little hard to find out the front of the house but no real big deal in adjoining streets.
"
1609922,11479082,2014-04-04,6945410,Cory,"Great townhome right in the heart of Ballard, pictures are very accurate of the clean modern place.  Was impressed that the owner called me during my stay to check on everything.  The description accounts for the parking challenges, but only had to park down the street so no big deal.  If you are looking for a 2br near the center of Ballard, this is a great choice!"
1609922,15330713,2014-07-07,15864137,Kelly,"Katie was a wonderful host.  We had great communication leading up to and during our stay.  She was wonderful about answering our questions quickly.  The house was amazing, cute and so comfortable!  The neighborhood conveniently within walking distance of a few restaurants and coffee! A very flexible and accomadating host.  She even left us a hospitality basket!  My family and I had a great time and felt right at home."
1609922,16065499,2014-07-21,15282932,Rebecca,Beautiful home and comfortable. Wish it was more walking distance to downtown ballard
1609922,17348413,2014-08-11,6563019,Adrianne,We had a wonderful trip and were lucky to stay in this lovely home! Everything was as described and the host was welcoming and helpful! It's also in our favorite Seattle neighborhood. We'll be back! 
1609922,18312350,2014-08-25,16890631,Matt,Katie & Dan's house was perfect. Ideally located with everything you would need for a stay. It was spotlessly clean and tidy and in a lovely neighbourhood.  We didn't actually meet our hosts but we asked many questions before and during our stay about where to eat and the best ways to travel downtown and they were extremely helpful throughout.  We were very impressed with Ballard itself. Great atmosphere about the place with lots of places to eat and some lovely shops. We visited the Woodland Zoo and Ballard Locks which are both nearby and definitely worth a visit and The Ballard Pizza Co was a great place to eat. Ballard market 2 minutes walk away was really good for groceries. We have no hesitation in recommending this house as somewhere to stay and would definitely use it again if we came back to Seattle.
1609922,18746635,2014-08-31,14064317,Catherine,"My family and I recently stayed in Katie's town home and love it. It's beautifully decorated, clean and actually a little bit roomier than the pictures make it seem. The beds were very comfy. We loved the location and neighbourhood and can't wait to go back! Thanks for your help and hospitality Katie."
1609922,19156416,2014-09-07,8015127,Seth,"My girlfriend and I had a very comfortable stay here with another couple. Everything was as described in the listing. Bonus points for the Stumptown coffee in the kitchen.

We were in town for a wedding so didn't get to explore the immediate area, but it's very close to the Walrus and the Carpenter and some other good restaurants. Discovery Park is about 5 minutes away by car. Twenty minute drive to downtown. 

Katie was incredibly responsive before and during the stay. 

I would stay here again."
1609922,20823869,2014-10-06,4564799,Elissa And Daniel,"We really enjoyed our stay here.  Perfect size for me, my wife and our 2 kids.  The townhouse was very comfortable and Katie and Daniel make you feel right at home.  Katie was super responsive to any questions.  Fantastic hosts!

We couldn't have asked for a better location.  An easy 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown Ballard and 5 minutes to all sorts of other amenities, restaurants and cafes.  Cafe Besalu has some of the best croissants you have ever tasted.  

We'll be back!"
1609922,23358194,2014-11-30,3965758,Randy,The Cute Cozy Townhome in Ballard was also very clean and comfortable... hotel-like.  We couldn't have been happier!  
1609922,26017420,2015-02-01,144765,May,"Adorable space in an ideal location to explore downtown Ballard. Katie & Dan were great hosts, they checked in on us and were very responsive with questions. Highly recommended!"
1609922,29228201,2015-04-05,24133405,Nancy,"Katie was very responsive to our initial booking request and all the follow-up questions we had. We coordinated our arrival easily and their home is a lovely town home in Ballard. We enjoyed the upstairs bedrooms w/ a jointly shared bath, making traveling with one of our parents easy and more cozy than two hotel rooms. The main floor with a living room and kitchen was nice to relax in during the evenings. Very clean and decorated nicely. We would enjoy a stay again! "
1609922,30236306,2015-04-19,3557813,Dina,"We had a great experience at Katie's townhome. Katie left us a welcome gift of local artisan popcorn and a bottle of wine... who doesn't love that! The townhome is conveniently located so we were able to walk to all the restaurants, shops, and farmers market in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle!"
1609922,33146607,2015-05-25,21731178,Tom,Katie was very easy to work with and we really enjoyed this awesome location in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and have already recommended Katie's home to our friends.
1609922,35787534,2015-06-22,28502057,Alexander,"Wir haben den Aufenthalt im Haus von Katie und Dan sehr genossen. Es ist alles sehr gemütlich, geschmackvoll und praktisch eingerichtet. Der Kontakt mit Katie war unkompliziert und sehr nett. Alles perfekt!"
1609922,37790014,2015-07-10,36831390,Peter,"Second leg of a trip to Vancouver and Seattle. Stayed for two nights.

Katie made everything really convenient! Although I never met her in person (we tried to but we got there late and something came up on her end), there was awesome communication and we were able to get in with no problem.  

The wife and my mom loved the place! So cute and quaint! Instruments available to play and books on shelves and in cabinets. Wife also loved the selection of amenities and how the rooms were decorated! Happy wife happy life right?! 

2 queen bed were comfortable and neighborhood had a really great vibe. Awesome restaurants and bars right around the corner stretching for blocks! It also wasn't as noisy as I thought it might have been at night. Very quiet except for small pockets of people walking by and chatting. Reminds me of Brighton/Allston area in Boston.

Seattle is a very cool and hip and it's reflected that while staying at Katie's! Awesome experience and would recommend the next person."
1609922,38130660,2015-07-13,501455,Steph & Julien,"We had a wonderful time staying at Katie and Dan's home. It's very comfortable and has everything you need to make the stay enjoyable. The location is awesome, so close to everything in Ballard and not far from downtown. Garage parking was a definite plus.
Communication was easy and everything went very smoothly. We highly recommend staying here! "
1609922,39008424,2015-07-20,33515373,Lindsey,"Katie and Dan were absolutely wonderful hosts! Their townhome has a very homey feel and is in such a great location. While staying there, our group was able to walk into Ballard, or take a quick drive to Fremont, Capitol Hill and Queen Anne. 

I look forward to staying in Katie and Dan's townhome again! 
"
1609922,39340777,2015-07-22,6170414,Lapde,"This townhouse was the best! My husband and dad stayed here during a short 2 night visit to Seattle but I could've seen myself living in this gem. The house was beautifully decorated and everything was clean and well organized. The floor plan and layout of the place maximized space and efficiency. Katie and Dan were great hosts and easy to communicate with. Dan met us at the house and gave us a tour before leaving us to our privacy. There was a private garage to house our car, which was super convenient. The house is located only a few blocks from the Ballard neighborhood, which had tons of great restaurants, bars, and shops. We absolutely loved staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone."
1609922,40299604,2015-07-29,14701855,Dosanna,"Condo was super clean and beautiful.  My dad and I did a father daughter trip, and this was so perfect for us given the 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living room, etc.  Blankets, towels, pots / pans, etc. were all really good quality, and honestly just made you feel like home away from home.  It made you feel like you were staying at a really good friend's house (who's clean / neat / has nice stuff) and who completely trusted you with their place.  We had a car so location wasn't a problem at all.  It was also great that there's a market across the street, a gas station right next door, and an AMAZING biscuit / breakfast sandwich shop the next street over.  All in all, this airbnb was awesome and worth every penny.  Host was super responsive in communication and helpful.  My dad and I was supposed to head up to Vancouver but I forgot my passport and was delayed a night in Seattle while I waited for my passport to be shipped over.  I had to book an additional night last minute, which the host was accommodating.  They immediately noticed that I was overpaying for fees since I had to book another separate night and had refunded me the amount - all without me asking for it!  Honestly, 5 stars for such honesty; I truly felt so comfortable staying here and would highly recommend it."
1609922,40946864,2015-08-03,37092566,Eva,"The town home was very comfortable and Katie and Dan left us a lovely welcoming note and some goodies. The house is filled with a wide variety of books, a piano and guitar, a well-equipped kitchen, and a nice layout for our small family.  The neighborhood is only a two-minute walk from the ""main street"" of Ballard with lots to do - restaurants, stores, parks, etc.  It is also near the main bus line into town.  It felt very safe.  We were there during an unusual heat spell, and there was no air conditioning, but there are balconies on both floors and good cross ventilation and fans."
1609922,41383498,2015-08-07,36469502,Rana,"They left us a friendly note with their contact information, if we needed them.  They also left us some treats and a refrigerator that contained many basic items.    The house was nicely decorated.  The D bus was a few blocks away and takes you downtown to Pike's Market.  There are 2 supermarkets within a short walk.  There is also a nice Italian restaurant about 2 blocks away on 15th.  We would recommend this accommodation and stay there again."
1609922,51045152,2015-10-17,4819835,Barb,"We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to others or return ourselves.  The house was plenty of space, warm, welcoming, comfortable and clean/ tidy. The location was perfect for public transit to the city and walking to  restaurants and shopping. We loved Ballard !  The essence of an Airbnb !  "
1609922,55207867,2015-11-29,45762173,Cathy,Everything was warm and welcoming. Katie made sure we got settled in. Perfect experience!

Met up with us right when we got to town, gave us advice on where to go, and offered us her number for any questions or concerns. The location was perfect! Walking distance to lots of fun places. We would highly recommend any of her places based on her hospitality. "
9138600,54621140,2015-11-22,1779104,Jerome,Kimberly is an excellent host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was nice and true to the description. Location is awesome. We were literally right around the corner from Pike's Market. I would definitely recommend her services to my family and friends. 
9138600,56253511,2015-12-11,31828158,Angela,Kim's apartment was in a wonderful location! She was extremely proactive in making sure we had everything we needed! Would def recommend this spot!!

5487522,28413739,2015-03-23,27507984,Sarah,"We had a really great stay at Louise's space in Seattle. 
The apartment was spacious and clean and had absolutely amazing views. 
Louise was an excellent host, she was quick to reply if I had any questions, and left little notes in the apartment so things were easy to find. We would definitely stay here again. "
5487522,30390051,2015-04-21,26537594,Mio,"Louise is a great host, her hospitality, and her cleanliness set her and her apartment miles apart from the rest. I have already recommend her to my friends traveling to beautiful Seattle and would highly recommend to anyone reading this."
5487522,33584095,2015-05-30,15516831,Michael,"Seattle is wonderful, and Louise's place is a great launch-spot for your visit!  Perfect location with quick access to downtown and Fremont, not to mention Queen Anne, Ballard and Magnolia!  It's a spacious place with two bedrooms and two full baths in an older, no-frills building.  There's a bit of a view of Lake Union where we sit and watch the seaplanes flying in and out in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The kitchen is nicely stocked so it was easy for us to prepare some meals (saving on quite a bit of eating out!).  We had a wonderful time!"
5487522,40376328,2015-07-30,2699861,Olga,Quiet neighborhood and apartment
5487522,41820633,2015-08-09,21567300,Yaro,Great place in a nice quiet location. Louise's apartment was neat and we had access to everything we needed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Seattle.
5487522,42566359,2015-08-14,11022803,Avi,"First off, the view is indeed spectacular. My daughter, wife and I all loved watching the seaplanes take off from Lake Union.  The location is good.  The building is right on two bus lines (the 26 and 28), and a few blocks away from another line (the 5).  Also, it's not too far to walk down to Lake Union, maybe 15 minutes, or even down to Seattle Center, maybe 30.  Not far from funky Fremont, either.  Lots of blackberries in the neighbor for kids to munch on, too, (at least in August when we visited). 

This is a great space that was perfect for our family's six-day visit to Seattle. Luxury-seekers take note, this apartment is not the Ritz.  It has wall to wall carpet and has comfy couches and beds, and a great living room/dining room with a table and chairs that seats four.  Two bathrooms and a kitchen with a good-size fridge for cooking, and plenty -- plenty! -- of living space.  Also has a long hallway, which lets different family members be in different parts of the house. Washer and dryer work great.  We were very comfortable.

Louise was a great host.  Her brother Rory was there to meet us when we arrived, and he showed us around, gave us keys, etc.  Louise contacted us to make sure all was well during our stay.
This is an excellent value, especially in a city as expensive as Seattle, and I'd happily stay there again. "
5487522,49365773,2015-10-03,34936450,Mateusz,"I had great time staying here. Louise is a great host. Even though my plane was late her brother waited for me 1h with a key. 
From the first minute I felt welcome and almost like at home. The place is spacious and comfortable.
Neighborhood is quiet. Bus was right outside, Fremont was a quick walk away.
Would recommend."
6991188,57147182,2015-12-22,27066622,Farah,"We truly enjoyed our stay in Washington! Ron was a great host, he made sure we had everything we needed upon our arrival and was easy to get ahold of should we have needed him. The little flat was great as well! Location was perfect to get to different buses heading into different districts and we loved how simple and cute it was. No complaints! Great place to stay :) "
6991188,58025094,2015-12-31,18783001,Lisa & Alan,"Ron's Marion Flat on Cherry Hill was very warm and cozy!  The space gave us the feeling of home away from home (something that hotels don't have!!) Ron was all smiles to greet us and made sure that we had everything we needed to be comfortable.  All the landmarks and popular restaurants that we wanted to visit were within a 10-15 minute drive which was great.  All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and will recommend this space to our friends and family!"
6991188,58378653,2016-01-02,1378582,Celia,"The Marion Flat is beautiful, spacious, clean, and very centrally located. It's close to night life on Capitol Hill and not a far drive from Pike Place, the space needle, and other attractions. 
Ron was very responsive and a welcoming host. Overall, it was a great stay for my boyfriend and me! Would highly recommend!"
8765219,53164038,2015-11-05,46011677,Marisa,"Just got back from Seattle and absolutely loved my stay at Sam's cozy home. The location was great -- an easy bus ride to Downtown Seattle and perfect area to walk around and enjoy some great restaurants and shopping. The space was very comfortable and clean, and quickly felt like a home away from home with everything you could need from a fully equipped kitchen to a washer-dryer! Really enjoyed my morning coffee in the beautiful backyard and listening to the great records Sam graciously left to be played on a vintage record player! Thank you Sam!! I would definitely like to stay here the next time I am in Seattle. "
8765219,55503545,2015-12-01,13976997,Jane,"Couldn't recommend a better place to stay in Seattle! The location is ideal -- walking distance to great coffee shops, bars, and restaurants, and not far from other fun neighborhoods and downtown Seattle itself. If you like running (or walking), this is a great starting point to explore the city (Green Lake, Gas Works Park, UW Botanic Gardens, etc). The house itself was also lovely, everything was very clean, and the beds were super comfortable. "
7462439,39882821,2015-07-26,118674,Lauren,"Great location and Matias and Dustin, as well as their upstairs neighbor were super helpful and gave us lots of tips on where to go, etc."

The house had everything we needed such as for cooking or do laundry! I also really liked the binder which listed places to eat nearby, WiFi info, etc."
8016610,49642057,2015-10-05,42999416,Candace,"We loved staying at this locations, it was very warm and welcoming.  Its out from the busy life of Seattle downtown and is in a very quiet, cute neighborhood.  It was nice to come back to after a day of walking around, we used Uber/cabs to get to the house and from everywhere we went it was usually about $10-$12.  The house decor is very rustic cabin and makes you feel like you are at home!  I would highly recommend Simon's house, you will love it!  "
8016610,51404027,2015-10-19,5537568,Joseph,Great experience. Booking was last minute but nonetheless smooth thanks to Simon and Pillow. The cottage is as advertised with really nice touches throughout. More than enough room for 4 adults and great amenities. The neighborhood is quiet and still coming along. Very convenient to Capitol Hill and the lake. We really enjoyed our stay. 
8016610,55380590,2015-12-01,16084743,Trese,Simon was a great host. He thought of the little extras to make our stay feel like a home away from home. We hope to return on our next visit.
8016610,57162233,2015-12-22,50679938,Logan,"A home away from home.

There was a gift bag waiting for us on the kitchen counter when we arrived.The inside of the house is completely updated with granite counter tops, a gas stove, modern lighting fixtures, a shower that looks like it came right out of The Jetsons, etc. Not a day went by that one of us didn't comment on how great the place was/is. We actually stayed in instead of going out to eat several nights, because we enjoyed staying there. On the evenings that it wasn't raining, we especially liked the fire pit in the backyard; we bought a few bundles of wood and made s'mores.

All-in-all, unless you are wanting to actually stay in the heart of downtown (which is slammed with construction and traffic), this is the place to stay. I know if I ever make it back, I will be hoping this house is available."
8016610,57808994,2015-12-29,7995431,Winter,"      Simon’s house has a very nice location near the Chinatown and a bunch of delicious restaurants around the house. Cuisines from every country can be found around the community. The pizza restaurant Simon recommended in the guide book is amazing as well. Since the house is also near the Pike Place market, it is very convenient as well. 
      The community is very quiet and I spent the first Christmas here in the United States with my parents. Simon’s house has a fantastic kitchen, with every kind of kitchen wares, spices. My mom cooked a hearty Chinese meal, giving me a sense of staying back at my home in Beijing. Whenever we encountered problems, Laisa was always available for help. Staying at their house proves to be comfortable and free. My whole family love Simon’s house a lot.

4461706,33469514,2015-05-28,3013570,Luke,"The Airstream was a perfect, unique way to experience the town in a relaxed and private environment. The Airstream was spotless and easily accommodated us. Tom went over all the details of how to use it and helped us get settled without a problem. We spent an enjoyable evening getting to know Tom and John, who were excellent hosts, and we loved the opportunity to get the inside scoop on where to go and what to do while we were there. 

Would highly recommend utilizing them as a way to get out of the business of downtown Seattle, but still be accessible to any activity that we wanted to do."
4461706,33869810,2015-06-01,12765999,Sara And Mike,"The Airstream was the perfect space for me during my visit to Seattle last weekend.  Tom was a very gracious host.  The Airstream is lovely inside and has plenty of room for one or two people. The queen-size bed is very comfortable, and there is a great cross-breeze from two bedroom windows.  One of the windows has a view of Lake Washington. The kitchen is well equipped. The bathroom is spacious (for a trailer), and the shower is good. The neighborhood is good for walking. You can walk down to Lake Washington and walk around the lakeshore trail.  The road is also very popular with Seattle bicyclists.

I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle but especially to someone who is considering buying a trailer and would like to see what it is like to live in one for a few days."
4461706,34042318,2015-06-03,9455871,Alex,"This airstream is awesome! I've always wanted to sleep in an airstream just to experience it and now you can if you are in Seattle. The interior is fully self contained with a shower, bathroom, kitchen and dining area. Temperature controls are accessed from the bed and there is even a flatscreen LCD next to the bed for those who like to watch shows before bed. Tom was an awesome host and i would highly recommend a night in the airstream!"
4461706,34492342,2015-06-08,28686319,Alex,"Tom and John are super friendly and Buster the dog is so cute and soft that we almost took him home ;)! The Airstream was SUPER clean and had all the comforts we wished for! The last morning of our trip Tom, John and Buster even took us on a trip to see a great waterfall and eat brunch! A last note is that the view from their place has a great view over the lake! "
4461706,35242080,2015-06-16,34149154,Janna,"Wonderful experience! The Airstream was like new and had all the amenities we needed. Our hosts were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay with them again. We were an easy walk to Lake Washington .Restaurants and grocery nearby.Highly recommend .
 Loved their dog, Buster!"
4461706,35508111,2015-06-19,35319369,Dylan,I had a great few days in Seattle staying in Thomas's airstream with my girlfriend. They live in a beautiful neighborhood with a fantastic home. As helpful as you can be and was very accommodating if we needed anything. First time in an airstream and also in Seattle and both fantastic experience. I would recommend this their place to everyone. 
4461706,35846304,2015-06-22,34924632,Kaitlyn,"My boyfriend and I visited Seattle for vacation and Tom, John and Buster were great hosts! The streamer was very clean and they were very welcoming and provided everything we could ask for, while still respecting our privacy. We only interacted a few times but they made us feel at home and at peace. We would recommend staying in the streamer to anyone and truly look forward to seeing them again on our future trips to Seattle! Cheers! "
4461706,36928413,2015-07-02,750565,Amy Lou,"I have always dreamed about staying in an Airstream (ever since I read Another Roadside Attraction as a teen)--now I can check that off my list! And the experience was SO MUCH better than I ever dreamed! The Airstream was a wonder of engineering and as neat as a pin--it seemed like it just rolled off the factory floor! The bathroom was surprisingly roomy (including a seat in the shower!) and the bed was ultra comfy. All this, with a jaw dropping view! PLUS, amazing hospitality from Tom and John. They were getting ready for their wedding, but found so much time to make us welcome and share their experience with the neighborhood. If you have the opportunity, stay in the lovely Airstream--you won't regret it! "
4461706,38051653,2015-07-12,31154255,Jon,This was our first Airbnb and it was a great experience. We were greeted like old friends and Buster couldn't say hello quick enough. The airstream itself is surprisingly spacious and full of character. I'd definitely recommend this as a place to stay.
4461706,38669774,2015-07-17,35921273,Andrew,The AirStream more than met my needs and Thomas was also a pleasure to work with. The living quarters were just as I'd hope for and the scenery was beautiful. Great experience!
4461706,39205799,2015-07-21,9892834,Jennifer,"Thomas and John made my daughter and me feel like family.  Their clean and sleek  Airstreamer, Margaret, provided us with a comfy and clean location from which to explore both Seattle and the long paths along the banks of Lake Washington.  We had a wonderful time and would easily do it again!  Thank you Tom & John!"
4461706,39967219,2015-07-27,36630200,Gerri,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it could not have been a better introduction. My stay at 'Streaming in Seattle was an incredible, one-of-a-kind experience. The Air-stream was just perfect for my needs; it was superbly well outfitted and Thomas & John were wonderful, assuring that I had every comfort while also being very respectful of my privacy. The views of Mercer Island and the lake were amazing and the location was just perfect for me to be able to walk everywhere without the need of even a rental car. I would give 'Streaming in Seattle, and my hosts Thomas and John, my very highest recommendation!!"
4461706,40263986,2015-07-29,1689710,Bretton,What a great place. The airstream is super nice and fully equipped. And just minutes from the city. 
4461706,40660603,2015-08-01,29756090,Eric,Tom and John were wonderful hosts! The Airstream was even better than we expected. It was very clean and comfortable - even in 90+ degree weather it stayed cool enough without having to even use the AC. Wish we could have had more time in Seattle and stayed a couple more nights in the Airstream. We'd definitely stay again if we make it back to Seattle. Thanks Tom and John!
4461706,40968039,2015-08-03,30123839,Sandy,"Tom and John were very welcoming, helpful, and friendly. We felt right at home glamping in their beautiful Airstream, and received excellent guidance on how to use all of the items in the Airstream. The Airstream was beautiful; very clean, neat, and a comfortable stay. Besides being a great place to stay, the novelty of being able to stay in an Airstream added a bit of adventure, as well!"
4461706,43577217,2015-08-20,13009595,Amber,"Tom (and Buster!) were wonderful hosts. We were introduced to the airstream and given the rundown of how everything worked as it was our first time staying in one. We also asked about the neighborhood and their beautiful home and it was wonderful to learn so much about both. It was a real treat to stay in Seattle's first neighborhood and Tom and Buster could not have been more welcoming and kind.

The airstream was very comfortable and quite spacious. The bed was cozy and the sheets soft. We enjoyed the cool Seattle nights and leaving the windows open to the breeze. It was a treat to experience coming from the heat of Arizona! The bathroom was also more spacious than I expected and showering and getting ready wasn't any problem at all.

I'm sure the kitchen set up would have worked well, but Columbia City was a 10-15 minute walk and provides plenty of dining options, so we enjoyed an amazing dinner at the Thai restaurant. The light rail isn't much further, so it is incredibly easy to head into Seattle 'proper' as we called it to explore or to head to SeaTac for flights.

Tom and John's place really is the perfect location. I love historic neighborhoods and theirs does not disappoint. If you stay, I hope you give yourself a few hours to walk around and enjoy admiring the homes. I was delighted by the architecture and variety of styles. I'm not sure if they do home tours in the area (we do plenty in the Phoenix area as fundraisers for our historic neighborhoods) but I would travel back to Seattle just to attend a home tour of this area. They day after my husband and I went on our own walking tour of the neighborhood, Tom took us on an extended driving tour of the neighborhood and pointed out even more amazing homes...and we got some stories about them! I loved it :)

If you are lucky enough to stay when the little strawberries from their rain garden are ripe, make sure to try them. They really shouldn't call them strawberries. They should call them flavorbombs. I don't think I've ever had anything more delicious in my life. Only with Airbnb, right?

'Streaming in Seattle provided the perfect hosts, a great retreat, the most darling neighborhood and the ideal location.

Thank you!!!"
4461706,44156847,2015-08-24,25328592,Andrew,Tom was very welcoming when we arrived and gave us a tutorial. He explained how to use the airstream because there are a lot of knobs and switches all around the cabin. I've never been in an airstream before. It felt very cozy and new with everything we wanted in the bathroom and kitchen.
4461706,45114460,2015-08-31,25965419,Sandra,"Thomas made us feel welcome by showing us around their beautiful, newly-renovated home ( with awesome lake views)! The trailer was super clean and included all amenities for our comfort- including internet access. Tom checked on us several times during our 3-night stay, inviting us to watch the football game and directing us to a great neighborhood coffee shop. The neighborhood was convenient to our destinations of Capital Hill and Downtown Seattle. We will definitely stay there again!"
4461706,45490713,2015-09-03,36999645,David,"Tom is the best Airbnb host ever. I'll get to the details of the great airstream in a sec, but first I have to tell you about how he selflessly rescued mine and my wife's marriage journal.

We went hiking at Discovery Park just before our flight out, and it wasn't until we got to the airport that we realized we had lost the journal at the park. It wasn't worth anything, but we couldn't replace the memories recorded in it, and we had no way of going back for it. And I felt like an idiot for leaving it on the roof of the car.

I texted Tom about the situation literally as the stewardess was telling us to put our phones in airplane mode. He could have very easily said I was crazy or just politely declined. But then when we landed I got a picture from Tom of our journal. He had dropped what he was doing, driven across Seattle to this park, and found our journal. Then the next day he had it shipped to us. 

Best host ever. 

Ok now the airstream:
The airstream itself was great. The mattress was very comfy, the air conditioner and fans all worked great, the shower had plenty of hot water, and it was very clean. By the time we left my wife and I were debating buying one instead of a house. 

When we got there Tom walked us through all the airstream details such as how to maintain the temperature and making sure we didn't turn off the water heater. 

There was also a welcome binder of things to do in Seattle and Tom was often on hand to recommend local places. Overall it was a wonderful experience and we would definitely stay here again!"
4461706,46184195,2015-09-08,41555061,Vanessa And David,"We had a great first Air BNB experience here! The Streamer was immaculate and Tom and John were very accommodating. We showed up late the first night and the arranged for us to have access to a key so we could get in without waking anyone up. There is a full binder they wrote inside the Streamer with information about how things work and good directions to the light rail, which was about a mile away. In the morning we got to say hello and ask questions about the place. While we had a great time exploring the city we really just liked hanging out in the Streamer! Great place to stay with very nice and communicative hosts."
4461706,46562492,2015-09-11,34779385,Richard,"We enjoyed our 1st experience with airbnb. We were on a road trip from Michigan and spending 2 nights in a beautiful airstream made for a fun and unique stay.
It was set up with everything we needed. There were maps of the area available  and information about using the local transit. 
Tom was a great host and his dog Buster was pretty cool too!"
4461706,46782726,2015-09-13,2309163,Max,"Tom and John were really easy to work with and the Airstream situation was really well thought out. Between their organization and the unit itself, we always had abundance of storage and room to relax. The property is just up the hill from a massive park that runs to the lake. It's a great area to walk and explore. I would stay here again!"
4461706,48133240,2015-09-23,43879318,Michael,"Tom and John’s airstream, Margaret, is immaculately clean and in near-new condition. Airstreams notorious quality and attention to detail made me feel like I was living inside a Swiss watch – with music! I stayed in her for one week by myself and found the space to be comfortable and of adequate size. I prepared at least one meal a day in the trailer (lunch and dinner) as well as showered and shaved without any problems. The best part (other than the hosts) was the Bluetooth sound system that operated seamlessly off my computer and iPad. I woke up to NPR and enjoyed Neflix or music in the evenings. The sound was rich and melodic and filled the space without any adjustments necessary as I moved around.
Tom and John really go out of their way to make their guests feel at home and make sure they have everything they need. They will include you in their own activities or leave you alone as you desire. They are both quality guys that I truly enjoyed getting to know. Read Tom’s novel “Airstreaming” if you have a chance. It is more than worthy of your attention. 
"
4461706,48964719,2015-09-29,24520185,Brian,"These guy's rock! They saved me from staying in SeaTac during a work trip. I was able to confirm my reservation with them within 1 hour of inquiry. The neighborhood was lovely with excellent scenery friendly neighbors. The Airstream  was very comfy with all the amenities of home. The shower was amazingly roomy and great water pressure. The bed was super comfy and if it were not for the stunning view of the sunrise over Lake Washington I would have spent more time in bed.

I had a nice interaction with Tom, John and Buster one morning. My last evening there they had me up to watch the lunar eclipse from there deck and enjoy a cocktail with the neighbors.

Columbia City has some great offering for food and drink and the staff at all establishments I visited were very friendly and helpful.
 

I got to interact with Tom "
4461706,49840131,2015-10-06,18722046,Melissa,"Tom and John were fantastic hosts and the Airstream was perfect for my trip to Seattle.  Tom checked in several times to ensure I had all that I needed for a relaxed and comfortable stay and was extremely helpful in recommending local coffee shops, restaurants and other must see spots.  Highly recommended and looking forward to going back!"
4461706,50565938,2015-10-12,35257145,Russell,"My wife, baby boy, and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here! The airstream was perfectly sized for our needs, super clean and very comfortable.

We really loved the location. We walked and picnicked down by Lake Washington, and had multiple breakfasts (and lattes) at Columbia City Bakery (just five minutes away!). The neighborhood felt very safe, which is always nice when you're traveling with a little one. 

This was truly such an awesome way to experience Seattle. Thomas and John (and Buster Brown!) were very welcoming, and (email hidden)d at the same time, we felt like we had our own little space to come and go as needed. 

10/10 would recommend. :) 

"
4461706,53146559,2015-11-05,946873,Jean Elizabeth Leitner,"We love new experiences. This listing was THE ONE from the moment I saw it. After connecting with the hosts, I was even more delighted. Not only was the unique airstream impeccably clean and cozy, Tom was attentive and so friendly. It's clear he loves his community and his favorite toy! He truly is the ""mayor"" of Mt Baker! I would stay here again for sure. Love the area, nearby restaurants and shops, light rail and walking trails. Parks everywhere! thx Tom!"
4461706,53552800,2015-11-09,47650333,Annalee,"Thomas, John and Buster were the best of hosts. My boyfriend and I loved every minute of our trip to Seattle. The airstream is a great deal. We loved having the little place to ourselves and Tom and John were great whenever we needed anything. 
"
9587410,57334599,2015-12-24,48431417,Harry,"Very cosy space, exactly as described and what we were looking for. Great neighbourhood and easy to get around Ballard and get downtown on the bus. Peggy was a lovely host and we enjoyed her hospitality immensely!"
9587410,58620895,2016-01-03,33394850,Denise,"Peggy's upstairs private bedroom and bath couldn't have been more perfect for my boyfriend and I's Seattle stay. She provided us with things to see and do in the Ballard neighborhood, and was a friendly face every time we came and went. She had coffee and snacks for us and was easy to communicate with via email and text. I would highly recommend staying with Peggy to anyone and would love to come back the next time we visit. "
7995944,45201323,2015-08-31,2414844,Jocelyn,"Matt and Rose welcomed us with the perfect balance of helpfulness respecting our privacy for a getaway in the city! The organic coffee, organic tea, and other organic snacks in the kitchen, and natural soaps throughout, were just part of the many little details that made this a sweet little spot. Tall people should know the ceiling is a bit low in the stairs and kitchen area, though I would still heartily recommend staying here!"
7995944,45358387,2015-09-01,42334636,Alexandra,Such a great visit! Matt was very accommodating and great at communication. The place was charming and exactly how described. Wish we could've stayed longer and will stay again if we visit Seattle again!
7995944,45745349,2015-09-05,12514652,Haley,"Mine and my fiance's stay at The Maple Leaf was perfect! Matt was great with a last minute reservation. The place is exactly as the photos represent, and so comfortable! We were really sad to leave. We will absolutely be back when we visit Seattle again. So happy to have found this place!!"
7995944,46048697,2015-09-07,28836383,Miya,"Matt and Rose were the perfect hosts!  The beautiful place, that looked exactly like the pictures, was amazing... a great spot tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle!  Parking and amenities were also great...we wanted to move in!!  Thanks for the awesome stay and restaurant recommendations you two! :) "
7995944,46256106,2015-09-08,5115005,Maaike,We had a great time at Matts place who was willing to have us very last minute. They thought about everything in the apartment. Very comfortable and relaxed. The location is a bit far out of town but perfect if you are heading north! 
7995944,47515080,2015-09-19,2492550,Ryan & Holly,We had a great stay here! Matt was very accommodating and we enjoyed the local restaurants. 
7995944,48911934,2015-09-29,20774432,Magen,This was an overall decent place to stay while visiting Seattle. We really enjoyed the location. The main issue we had was no sound insulation between the mother-in-law and the main house so it was a little noisy at times. 
7995944,50128423,2015-10-09,14898710,Molly,I enjoyed my stay here! It's decorated really well and has lots of little details to it. Matt was easy to communicate with and responds quickly to any questions I had.  
7995944,50400379,2015-10-11,14898710,Molly,Everything was great- just an extended stay from the other review.
7995944,50474008,2015-10-12,26331860,Adrienne,We had a great night at the Maple Leaf Mother-in-law!  It looked exactly like the pictures and was cozy and had everything we needed.  
7995944,51199712,2015-10-18,41390639,Melody,"I enjoyed my stay at the mother-in-law apartment, and I would stay here again. It is a great value, with a full kitchen, washer and dryer, dining table and chairs, large-screen TV, DVD player, and a very comfy bed and couch. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood just south of Northgate Mall. Because the apartment is attached to the main house, there was some noise from the house, but it never lasted long and didn't bother me. There are some restaurants and coffee shops a few blocks away, as well as a great independent DVD rental store. Matt responded promptly to any questions or concerns I had. I also got to meet his family, and they are all charming. Overall a wonderful experience!"
7995944,51638078,2015-10-22,594768,Anne,"This location was close to perfect, for all the places I drove in and around Seattle.  Having a parking spot when I returned each day was great.  The full kitchen was just what I was hoping for.  Having my own entrance was nice.  I would stay here again."
7995944,52192666,2015-10-26,12610882,Lauren,"First and foremost, I would highly recommend staying at Matt's Maple Leaf Mother-in-law suite.  Not only was it clean and stylish but it had a very private feeling with the entrance facing the alley.  My favorite part about our visit, however, were all the little details.  It was the bath products left for our use, the ear plugs and eye mask by the bed, the puffy slippers waiting for us at the door, the organic cocunut sugar for our coffee.  These are what made our visit feel so special.  Thanks, Matt!  "
7995944,52736366,2015-11-01,11826047,Lauren,Matt was great! The place was very clean and so adorable! I would definitely stay there again! Lots of organic treats too! :)
7995944,53303919,2015-11-07,48016477,Kara,"This was our first airbnb experience! The space was private and we loved the way it was decorated. It looked just like the pictures. The neighborhood was cute and quaint. We had a rental car and it was super easy to drive to any other neighborhoods we were interested in seeing. It was nice to have a unique experience like this instead of spending money on a chain hotel! Also, Matt responded very quickly to messages and gave us all the info we needed. We felt like he and his wife were readily available if we needed anything! We would definitely stay again! Thanks Matt and Rose!"
7995944,53796398,2015-11-12,9560573,Adam,"Matt's place was even better than I had anticipated. Completely private with alley facing entry. Dedicated parking spot. Lime Coconut-Strawberry hand soap in the bathroom, are you kidding me?! Awesome!! You'll definitely feel cared for with all the amazing little personal touches everywhere you look. Would definitely stay here again, and would absolutely recommend this to anyone coming to Seattle! Don't forget to look at the notebook on the coffee table! It's full of useful information! Including local attractions, and Matt and his wife's top pics for dining! Such a great added touch! Matt was easy to get ahold of, and quick to reply. Great guy! Thanks Matt!"
7995944,54163616,2015-11-16,3667497,Carla,"For our first Air BnB experience, I could have asked for a better accommodation. The in-law unit was exactly as the photos and description portrayed.  The apartment was clean, warm (literally) and inviting. 

The kitchen had everything you needed to create or warm up a meal. If you need the basics: olive oil, coconut oil, sea salt, peper mill, even fresh coffee beans and coconut sugar, its there.  The bed was comfortable and the ear plugs and eye mask was a nice addition, though the neighborhood is very quiet and dark at night. 

Did you forget your deodorant? Need conditioner or even makeup cleaning cloths? Its available for you.  All of the bathroom supplies from the hand soap to the toothpaste is made from natural ingredients and is eco friendly. 

The apartment is located in a very convenient area. There is a Whole Foods and a 24-Hour Fitness within a mile. The neighborhood is very quiet and my husband and I was able to sleep soundly.  We would definitely go back!"
7995944,54882244,2015-11-25,18228757,Natalie,"Can't say enough good things about this place. The decor was charming, clean and inviting with subtle touches that made us feel right at home. We found great places to eat and relax nearby and the location was perfect for us. I had a class up by Lake Washington and my sister spent her days in the central part of the city. It was very convenient to come and go as we pleased without feeling we were disturbing the owners. I have to return to Seattle several times this year and plan to stay at this charming suite. My only concern for others is that the shower is a bit low for those over about 6'3"". Otherwise, you can't be this place for the price! "
7995944,55302525,2015-11-29,14711,Ming Yeow,"Great house. big, comfortable and cozy!"
7995944,55310715,2015-11-29,17389950,Ouadia,"I stayed in this place only for 1 night , so I can't say much other than it was clean and well maintained!
Thanks!"
7995944,55829963,2015-12-06,49280171,Alissa,"This was a fantastic first AirBnB experience.  The apartment met or exceeded all expectations, and my husband and I had everything we needed for a relaxing stay.  I appreciated extra amenities like space heaters, extra blankets (it's easy to get cold on a rainy December weekend in Seattle!), and a Roku for streaming movies and music.  Everything was clean and all instructions for parking, key entry, etc. were sent to me promptly before arrival.  We did not interact with the host at all (the apartment feels very private and secluded, which we appreciated), although he stated they would be available if we needed anything. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends!"
7995944,56534068,2015-12-14,18369627,Laura,"Staying here was incredible! We were so comfortable and everything was available to us. I loved that everything was organic and environmentally friendly! but what I loved the most was the privacy of the place; It was incredible to have your own entrance and own parking spot after full days trying to find parking in downtown Seattle. Matt was a great host and came to welcome us the day we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Seattle! Thank you so much Matt, we loved your place! "
7995944,57334474,2015-12-24,2348502,Constance,"I didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, as we were out for most of the morning and day, visiting with family and friends. But the hosts left a little binder of recommendations and Matt responded quickly to messages and texts. The suite was very clean and accommodating. My stay was comfortable. We had access to cafes and restaurants, but had to Uber our way into the city. There were buses but I found the travel was longer than expected. Overall, I enjoyed our stay and would book this place again! :)"
7995944,57681206,2015-12-28,31371599,Colleen,The Maple Leaf Mother in Law was just perfect for us!  Getting there and getting in was a breeze and Matt was very helpful and communicative before and during our stay.  It's a great space and feels homey and very clean.  We wish our plans had allowed us to stay longer and take advantage of the full kitchen.  The extra amenities like shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom were very much appreciated by this forgetful traveler and the bed was sooo comfy.  Matt even provided us with warm house shoes and extra heaters since it was chilly.  We'd definitely come back to this great space in a cute neighborhood.
7995944,58057480,2015-12-31,50336243,Beatriz,We loved our stay at Matt's place. We felt at home throughout our stay and very easy access to all of Seattle yet away from the downtown rush. We will love to stay here again.
2802844,21324134,2014-10-14,7793402,Camille,"Gerry's place was exactly as depicted: it was beautiful and extremely clean. The bed was very confortable. 
Gerry was always available to answer me and ma de everything easy.
I recommend everyone to stay a his place!"
2802844,21677898,2014-10-21,9580963,Regula,"Gerry has a nice and clean place. We really liked it. the comfortable bed, the quiet and friendly neighbourhood, the little details like a really good (quality) bodywash and shampoo. 
We didn't see to much of each other though. but With Gerrys notes we found everything and new what we had to know.
Thanks"
2802844,22032971,2014-10-28,17335507,Pn,"Gerry's room was exactly as described, beautiful, clean and well-organized. We spent 3 nights at the house while visiting city. The kitchen is clean and serviceable for home-cooking, and the neighborhood has a lot to offer in terms of food and nightlife. I definitely recommend peers and friends to stay at Gerry's place on future trips to Seattle! Thank you for a great stay :)."
2802844,23792674,2014-12-10,23472094,William,We loved every moment. Perfect host along with the perfect place!
2802844,25312551,2015-01-12,16355267,Lydia,"Had a relaxing, low-key weekend at Gerry's ultramodern townhouse in the Central District.  Gerry was very accommodating to my super-late arrival in town and had everything I needed (including the wireless password!) ready to go.  The room (memory foam bed!) and living area were warm and inviting in the rainy Seattle weather -- perfect for curling up with a Kindle or real book.  The private bathroom (+ bidet!) was very, very nice and conveniently located right next to the bedroom. 

The location was perfect for me -- this trip was to visit friends living nearby, so I cannot attest to its convenience for getting to more tourist-y parts of Seattle (but if you're into thrifting, it's not too far from the world's largest Goodwill).  The neighborhood is mainly residential, and it was nice to walk around and see the new modern homes (Gerry's complex included) going up among the old Craftsmans and apartment buildings.  "
2802844,28883359,2015-03-31,8903082,Benjamin,"Finest host I have ever experienced. Everything in the listing is completely accurate except that the reality is more pleasing than what you will see virtually. I enjoy spending time in the ID and its walkable for me (I tend to enjoy longer walks through colorful neighborhoods) and it was a less than ten minute drive to/from the convention center. Easy to get to from Seatac, easy access to I5, ferry to port and cab or bike are recommended as well but it will be a challenging climb from the port by bike. 
Accommodations are the best. Bed is comfy. Everything is extra clean. I don't know who this would be a problem for but i guess the easiest way to say it is if you really hate modern homes and the associated lifestyles you might not like it.  "
2802844,32588839,2015-05-19,5951266,Gus,"Gerry's house is full of good design and furniture. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet, and the bathroom was top notch. He was a very pleasant host who mostly let us spend our time to ourselves. "
2802844,33897589,2015-06-02,2515643,Julia,"Our stay with Gerry was a great experience and certainly made our trip to Seattle all the more enjoyable.  The accommodations were exactly as described/depicted and very comfortable.  It was also a great location to easily access the downtown areas.  I would definitely stay with Gerry again on any future trips to the area!  If you are looking for an affordable but homey-feeling location, this is the place!"
2802844,34638398,2015-06-10,16997520,Melissa,"Gerry is a fantastic host, kind and so courteous. This place is exactly as described, and more. This room is on the second floor, where there is also a living room and private bath. It is airy, very comfortable and feels just like home. The bonus is the beautiful exterior and interior design. It is located in a residential neighbourhood about 35 min walk from downtown, or a short 15 min bus ride (that is just a few steps away). I highly recommend it!"
2802844,35998053,2015-06-24,13626274,Ana,"Gerry made us feel welcome and helped us out with what to do and see around Seattle.  The house was spotless.  His is an interesting  house located quite close to the city which was fabulous! We had a car and always found parking spaces on the street.
The place is located in a quiet neighbourhood with a park close by."
2802844,42374835,2015-08-13,17953055,Michael,"Gerry's place is exactly as advertised. He is a gracious host. He has a well prepared list that is available at arrival describing the setup of his place, how things are are arranged in the house, bus lines, close by places to eat. 
We really enjoyed staying at Gerry's. The layout is comfortable. Especially liked the work area in the bedroom. Although the use of coffee and maker was offered, there is a very nice coffee shop a short block away which is never too crowded and doesn't have attitude. 
Location is close to downtown and bus stops are nearby. For a those not familiar with Seattle, bus service is OK during the week, on weekends you'll need a car or LYFT/ Über. 
The neiborhood is mixed ethnic so food choices vary without having to go far. There is a large well used park across the street. 
Lastly, Gerry loves to bake chocolate chip cookies. 
"
2802844,45458268,2015-09-03,9393791,Charmaine,"Great location, super clean and comfortable home. Gerrys always communicates very promptly.  
My partner and I were in town for a 4 day convention, PAXprime and it was a short Uber ride down town. Great local food and Gerry had a list of recommendations, tips and wifi details ready, which was very helpful."
2802844,48384221,2015-09-26,22509548,Robin,"Gerry is a great host and his home is precisely described as his description at Airbnb: very modern, clean and cosy. Also, Gerry is very helpful, to provide us a lot of suggestions for our itinerary. We would like stay with Gerry once again if we have are back. "
2802844,50478457,2015-10-12,6067616,Cassie,Gerry was a great host! In the few interactions we had with him he was very kind and accommodating. The location was also great as it was right beside a bus stop that took you straight to downtown Seattle. The apartment was very clean and everything from the bed to the heated toilet seat was hotel-worthy. I definitely recommend this place!
2802844,54903455,2015-11-25,48079011,Sining,"I'm glad I stayed in Gerry's home, as this was the very first time I was doing airbnb. The neighborhood was pretty nice, quiet and not far from the downtown area (10 mins for cab/uber). There was a nice coffee shop close by - a saver for a coffee addict like me on my way to work. The guest room was comfortable and private, full of fun decorations. I really enjoyed staying there.  "
2802844,55655330,2015-12-04,41922424,Lisa,"My first Air Bnb experience was a flawless stay at Gerry's beautiful townhouse!   Coordinating access to the house was smooth and Gerry had information well laid out on how to navigate the home as well as local recommendations.  The home was also tastefully decorated with Gerry's own photography!  My room and bathroom were very clean, cozy, and comfortable.   I had a rental car and I was able to get street parking right in front.  It was also a pleasure chatting with Gerry and his girlfriend - lovely people!"
7481498,39715945,2015-07-25,6273172,Melissa,"The host went above and beyond to help/accommodate my family and  I. She was quick with responding to my inquiry and also warmly invited me into her living space. She gave me the keys and walked me through everything in her house. She was gracious and shared everything with us as well. We were a last minute book and she was able to turn around the apartment quickly for us. She was truly a life saver and AIRBNB needs more people like Heidi! 
The neighborhood was great and we were literally located 8-9 mins from all main tourist attractions by car. This is a quiet neighborhood and also had wonderful stores around the house for food and coffee. There is ample street parking outside as well that doesn't require you to move your car all day (if you'd like) - super rare in Seattle. The only call out is that there are stairs to get to this apartment so it might be difficult for someone that has mobility issues. The stairs are not bad though...it's 7 steps and then a landing (where you can catch your breath). Maybe a total of 25 steps (?) are there. It wasn't an issue for us at all. Lastly, the house is located on a steep hill so parking can be a little nerve wrecking if you are not used to it. Heidi, being the awesome chica she is, came to the rescue and taught me how to park on the hill and I learned quickly to master hill parking! 
At the end of the day, it was a wonderful space and I will rent again from her in the future. "
7481498,40830436,2015-08-02,20417293,Emma,"Great place to stay in Seattle, local cafes easy public transport to downtown which is close by. Heidi provided everything in her clean apartment we needed for a comfortable stay, well equipped kitchen, comfy beds, washer/ dryer, wifi, even leaving local coffee to get us started and some colouring books and crayons for my daughter. Right near the well known steps locals use for a great workout ( but don't worry that's not the way to cafes or downtown so you can avoid if you don't want the challenge. Fun if you do). Absolutely recommend this place!"
7481498,42034213,2015-08-10,27366877,Amazyl,Heidi has been super responsive and very helpful despite a late arrival.  The apartment is charming and quiet.  I definitely recommend it for a short stay in Seattle. 
7481498,42744727,2015-08-15,15439473,Adele,"Heidi's place is awesome.  Really homely, cool and Heidi made us feel right at home. She was welcoming and always contactable, giving us some great tips for our stay in seattle. We had everything we would ever need and more. I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in seattle."
7481498,45297728,2015-09-01,16479781,Michael,"4 of us stayed here for PAX 2015, and it was a great choice! Just outside downtown in Eastlake, it's wonderfully quiet and the views are beautiful. Heidi's place is a cozy apartment and instructions were left for anything we might've needed. Heidi was there to check us in, and made sure to check back with us after we had spent a night to make sure everything was okay. Heidi is very accomodating and we would definitely stay again. 

The only thing that I could even try to make a negative comment about is the double bed, and it really isn't a big deal, but it's suuuper creaky. Took a little bit to get used to the first night, but after PAX began, I would crawl into bed and sleep like a log."
7481498,45695103,2015-09-05,11338053,Nicole,"This place is a nice option for groups of three or four people, because it’s a private unit while also having multiple rooms (as opposed to an open space studio). Though we didn’t meet with Heidi in person, checking in and out was simple, and all amenities (towels, sheets, wi-fi access, etc.) were clearly labelled, easy to find, and functional. The space felt like a home and was as pictured and described. 

A note for those with accessibility considerations: the apartment is situated in a hilly neighborhood, so please take heed of the stairs and inclines!
"
7481498,46523968,2015-09-11,11721951,Christine,"Heidi’s place is lovely. My co-worker/friend and I stayed there for 3 nights while we attended a conference at the “Hutch”—which was a short and pleasant walk away.  The photos give a good sense of the space—it was very clean throughout and so thoughtfully and eclectically decorated in a way that made me want to come home and re-do my whole now-boring house :)   We never met Heidi in person, but she was quick to reply with any questions and left really helpful notes about wifi, supplies,recycling, etc.  The lockbox was great—not only for easiest check-in and check-out—but really perfect for sharing space with another person who doesn’t necessarily have the same itinerary.  I will note, as other reviewers have, that the apartment is on a hilly street and up a bunch of stairs on top of that.  It made it a bit challenging for me (wearing an air-cast boot), but it was workable. One other note: from the larger bedroom, with the windows open, the highway noise might disturb a lighter sleeper (really didn’t bother me though). I will definitely look to stay at Heidi’s place again when I return to Seattle."
7481498,48625376,2015-09-27,44531066,Andrea,"We appreciated Heidi's hospitality and warm welcome.  Her home functioned as a comfortable place to stay during a friend's wedding.  I wasn't quite used to the steep hills in Seattle, but I enjoyed the fun cat decorations and mature artwork about the house. "
7481498,49532005,2015-10-04,44030788,Siri,"Heidi was great and greeted us at the apartment when we arrived. She gave us helpful tips on where to go and what to see, and what her favorite tourist activities were around town. The apartment was adorable and the perfect size for 2-3 people. I even left my books there and she offered to ship them back to me! The building is in a great location, we walked all over the place. It was a wonderful experience all around and we will definitely be back to visit. Thanks Heidi!"
7481498,51226762,2015-10-18,45108160,Austin,"Heidi was very welcoming and easy to contact.  She was very quick to reply to any questions or concerns regarding our stay.  Her apartment was as advertised and was a welcomed space to crash during our weekend stay in Seattle.  As others have mentioned, the neighborhood, while quaint and scenic, is extremely hilly and would not be best for anyone with any physical ailments.  All in all, the place was exactly what we had hoped it would be prior to arrival, and we would not hesitate to try and stay here again."
7481498,53303645,2015-11-07,15580861,Robin,"I thought this was such a sweet spot to be. Walking to Capitol Hill was a breeze, and being so near a great bus line is super helpful if you don't have a car. The apartment is just adorable, super clean, and the perfect size for one (though large enough for more). As for Heidi, she was gracious and accommodating -- I would love to return again, because it was all just splendid: "
2586350,14131725,2014-06-12,4918490,Janelle,Akiko and Matt have a beautiful home and were absolutely lovely hosts. We had a perfect experience staying in Seattle in their basement suite. The location is awesome as it is within walking distance to the light rail station and the place itself is cozy with everything you could need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle!
2586350,14176241,2014-06-13,16474811,Jerry,"Great place to stay, Akiko and Matt were very friendly and helpful. We really loved the mattress, it's comfy!
Parking was very easy and light rail to DT and stadium just several blocks away. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended and thanks again Akiko & Matt! "
2586350,14633211,2014-06-23,1962553,Anastassia,Akiko and Matt were wonderful hosts and their in-law apartment is fantastic! My mom and I had a great experience staying for the week while house-hunting and we would definitely stay again. The property is close to everything / downtown Seattle but very quiet and tucked away on a nice side street. It was a very smooth process communicating with Akiko and Matt and they were very kind and thoughtful during our stay. What a great airbnb! 
2586350,14844636,2014-06-27,17057144,Aralee,"The Hosts were great.  The place was well appointed, clean and spacious.  Very comfortable and private setting. The house was easy to get to from the freeway.  Not close to downtown but very accessible and quick to get there. The only drawback is the neighborhood is up and coming.

Thanks for the great stay!"
2586350,14988855,2014-06-30,231013,Margarita,"Akiko and Matt were great hosts. Super easy to communicate with and they greeted us on check in.  The apartment was perfect.  It felt like a little sanctuary to a super busy weekend.  Lots of parking, apartment had everything you need and was super comfortable. "
2586350,15107351,2014-07-02,3137232,Paul,"Akiko and Matt were super responsive and fantastic hosts! The accommodations were superb and exceeded our expectations. Great location close to banks, UPS store, groceries, transportation and more...Will certainly stay there again if there is availability! "
2586350,15231651,2014-07-05,537827,Ivan,all was good - hosts were helpful and friendly
2586350,15335474,2014-07-07,16383968,Marijoyce,"Akiko and Matt had an awesome apartment.  Upon arriving to the apartment, Akiko greeted us - she's super friendly!  The apartment was super clean and was complete with many amenities including: a welcome binder, coffee maker, fridge, etc.  The deck (pictured) was an beautiful and the perfect place to watch multiple 4th of July fireworks.  I would definitely consider staying at this place again if we need a place to stay in Seattle.  The apartment was within a decent distance from a lot of places.  We didn't have a car but we had friends who had no problem finding the place to pick us up and we also utilized transportation services to get around - which was not difficult at all.  "
2586350,15470260,2014-07-09,15099353,Kathy,"My sisters and I loved the two nights we spent at Akiko and Matt's place! Our hosts were wonderful and accommodating and everything about the apartment was top-notch. My sisters raved about the comfort of the bed and I got a good night's sleep on the couch. The towels were thick and soft and the sheets were wonderfully fresh-smelling and comfortable. The toiletries provided far exceeded expectations. The kitchen was well-stocked with plenty of appliances, dishes, utensils, coffee, and tea. Akiko was more than happy to let us use her washer and dryer, but we were so busy touring Seattle that we decided to make do with the clothes we had. The location was convenient to the city yet away from the noise and hubbub. We would stay at Matt and Akiko's place again without a moment's hesitation!"
2586350,15542975,2014-07-11,11125952,Brian,"Matt & Akiko were amazing! We arrived early and stayed late and they were very accommodating. The place was everything we were looking for with a fully furnished kitchen and extra room to make ourselves feel at home. The bed was really comfortable with fresh linens, the bathrooms extra clean. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
2586350,15825395,2014-07-16,5438936,Jane,"Matt and Akiko were terrific hosts, very easy to communicate with. We only had the opportunity to meet Matt during our stay. He was very friendly and showed obvious pride in ownership of his home. The apartment was beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable for three people in our family.The neighborhood had an interesting multicultural mix of people and appeared to be in the process of being redeveloped. It was convenient to downtown Seattle and close to the light rail. Matt and Akiko  provided a booklet that contained recommendations to area restaurants and we enjoyed a meal at a great local organic/vegan restaurant and the next day had lunch across the street! We would not hesitate to stay at Matt and Akiko's apartment if we return to Seattle."
2586350,15899046,2014-07-17,987658,Rachel,"I enjoyed my stay with Akiko and Matt and would stay again. They welcomed me on short notice, and checkin and communication were excellent. The apartment was well-stocked, clean, and comfortable, as well as easy to find, and parking and access were a breeze. Akiko and Matt were there to greet me, and were very friendly and accommodating hosts. I would stay again for sure! "
2586350,16105784,2014-07-22,16631104,James,"Akiko & Matt are wondeful people and extremely accomadating. Akiko and Matt made us feel right at home. They did a great job making sure everything was fine and Matt provided some great tips for places to visit.
I'm just sorry we didn't get the chane to chat with them a little more prior to leaving.
Thanks again for a great stay!!!
"
2586350,16193721,2014-07-22,16153612,Steve,"This was a perfect place for us. We were ready to give up on Seattle after spending the night in a Wal-Mart parking lot. We had not made prior arrangements anywhere, it was late and for 6 hours we could not find any accommodations. The next morning we contacted this listing and they were very quick to respond with a reservation for that night so we decided to stay and tour Seattle.
Upon check in we found the apt just as pictured - clean, nicely decorated and the bed....oh the bed! Sweet! We loved it but what we loved even more was this couple, Matt and Akiko. They are sweet, warm and welcoming. They have a true gift of hospitality. We sat on the elevated deck and over a glass of wine they helped us with local suggestions. This was appreciated since we only had 24 hours before flying back to FL.
They made sure we saw the Space Needle and Pikes Place Market both of which are a treat.
Later that night they sent us to a totally unique restaurant called ""The Pink Door"". We would have never found this place on our own....and it's a gem. They even knew where to go for our chocolate martini desert - ""Tini Bigs"".
To top off the night they left, on our door step, a bottle of their favorite wine - in celebration of our 45th anniversary.
We loved this place, the hosts, and would highly recommend it!
By the way they even mailed us our laundry that we overlooked...oh and we do expect to hear when the little one is born...hint hint*

2586350,16260239,2014-07-24,1639347,Amy,"We just returned home after a wonderful visit at Akiko and Matt's Seattle home.  The neighborhood was a totally new area for us and we found it very rewarding!  It was culturally diverse, fascinating, worthy of future visiting.  Seward Park is wonderful and full of walking trails and beach waters. 

The apartment  was beautifully appointed and really was the best equipped kitchen we have ever visited!!  We loved that because we did cook!  Very spacious and cozy.  The hosts saw to every detail.  Impressive!

Akiko met us as we arrived and was very communicative during the booking process.  Easily a place to which we will return!  We look forward to investigating the light rail system so easily accessible from this interesting neighborhood.  Amy and Bill  "
2586350,16529002,2014-07-28,189515,Heather,"This experience taught me to not only research accomodations, but also surrounding areas and neighborhoods. It was not a good fit for us. Thats all i will say about that."
2586350,16643433,2014-07-30,12432647,Andrea,"Akiko and Matt's home was great. It is exactly as pictured. The rental is essentially a basement in-law suite. The rental was awesome inside; it featured a large flat screen TV with HBO, full kitchen with coffeee/teas, tempurpedic mattress, and Aveda hair products. The rental was very clean. Akiko and Matt provided us a binder that outlined local restaurants, grocery stores, and other amenities. Additionally, Akiko and Matt were very responsive hosts. My boyfriend and I highly recommend their home and hope to visit again in the future! "
2586350,16694668,2014-07-31,2506555,Daniel,"The house is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood of Seattle a short drive from the airport.  As advertised the apartment is the lower (basement) floor of a small but charming house.  The apartment is illuminated by windows, so it doesn't seem like a basement, and the space is pleasant.  I did not meet the hosts but everything was very much in order and well thought out."
2586350,17362199,2014-08-11,15201374,Thanh And Daniel,"We had an excellent experience at Akiko and Matt's home. They are great hosts and extremely friendly. They welcomed us with smiles and generosity. The home was very clean and comfortable. We all slept peacefully and everything was quiet. The backyard and balcony provide beautiful scenery. We had friends fly in from the east coast and the drive from the airport was quick. The home is very conveniently located for an optimal Seattle experience.  We made it to the waterfront and Pike Place market in less than 15 minutes. We had takeout Chinese food from downtown Seattle. Akiko and Matt provided a 3 ring binder of information that included places to eat and amenities. We had free WiFi access and cable television. The kitchen had all utensils and appliances (oven, stove, coffee maker, and fridge). We were able to iron our clothes. All bathroom supplies were provided. All of us had an excellent experience at Akiko and Matt's home. We would stay here again and recommend this home to friends and family. "
2586350,17628359,2014-08-15,5943158,Courtney,Akiko and Matt's place was exactly what was pictured and a nice place for us. They were very accommodating when we request an additional guest for our stay. Communication before and during our stay was great and they were very friendly upon our arrival.   
2586350,17951225,2014-08-19,2316268,Vinh,A great experience all around. The house is very clean and provided plenty if room for 3 people. The kitchen was well stocked. Grocery store is only 5 minutes away. We had two comfortable queen beds. Getting to downtown took about 20 minutes. Would recommend this place is you want to stay close to downtown Seattle. The neighborhood has a mix if different cultures. Absolutely no issues with outside noise. On street parking was easy to find. 
2586350,18321124,2014-08-25,17482814,Yoshio,"Matt and Akiko went out of their way to accommodate and make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  Everything was as advertised, and then some.  The deck was the perfect place to a sunny afternoon; the apartment itself was the perfect place to spend a short getaway in Seattle.  
Many thanks Matt and Akiko!"
2586350,18512494,2014-08-27,20243466,Alex,"While passing through Seattle, we spent a few nights to tourist around. The space is awesome and was much bigger and more luxurious than we were expecting. It had a large lounge room, full kitchen with all the cookware available, separate bedroom and private entrance. The biggest advantage was the 10ish min walk to the Othello train station, which makes visiting town very easy. We had a car with us and plenty of street parking made life a lot easier."
2586350,19398687,2014-09-11,9831394,Aaron,"The apartment was very nice and just like it was pictured.  Definitely the nicest house on the block.
"
2586350,19535275,2014-09-14,19594479,Phil,"Matt and Akiko are extraordinary hosts, gracious, fully accommodating and authentically generous.  It was a bit like staying with family as we sat together, around the fire-pit, relaxing with a glass of wine on our first night.  

The apartment is elegant and spotless, well furnished and rather ideal.  At the end of a busy day, happily spent working and noshing on the elevated deck, retreating to the cushy bedroom and a hot bath was superb.

The property is a quiet, upscale, retreat in a pleasant urban setting.  Restaurants and services abound within easy walking distance."
2586350,19894492,2014-09-20,20829131,Vina,"Stayed a total of 4 nights and it was pleasant. Akiko was responsive and informative during the booking process. The place was exactly as pictured and noted and the check-in was very fast and smooth. Akiko was very sweet and welcoming, we even got to meet her baby and she is absolutely adorable! The place was very clean and comfortable. 

Besides the house and kind hosts, the neighborhood gave off a slight uncomfortable vibe. We weren't walking around at night and nothing happened to us but we did get a sketchy vibe. I'm only noting this because my boyfriend and I were planning on not renting a car and walking to the light rail close to the house, we decided to rent a car last minute and I'm glad we did! Please don't make this note the determining factor for your stay if you're interested, I'm only speaking about the neighborhood, we felt very comfortable and safe at the house and were very pleased. Thank you Akiko and Matt, you've made our first airbnb experience great!  "
2586350,20031597,2014-09-22,16669591,Gustavo,"Everything was great, space, location, price and amenities.  Thank you guys!"
2586350,20623118,2014-10-02,21503466,Kathy,"What a delightful find!  Matt and Akiko are great hosts.  The apartment is clean, quiet, private, and has the most comfy bed ever.  The sofa is comfy, nice big flat screen TV and DVD player for relaxing after a long day.  It was just 2 of us on business for a week.  We could spread out with 2 desks, nice kitchen.  All the comforts of home.  Extremely convenient location.  Lots of great ethnic restaurants plus easy access into downtown Seattle.  We'd love to go back.  "
2586350,21260358,2014-10-13,11986177,Lachlan,"Matt and Akiko's place is excellent. The location is an easy 10min walk to the light rail, which will take you straight into downtown Seattle. Pre-arrival arrangements were well-organised and Akiko was helpful and flexible with arrival time. The apartment is clean, spacious and has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. I highly recommend this apartment if considering staying in Seattle for a few days."
2586350,23176747,2014-11-24,23492983,Katherine,We had a great stay at Matt and Akiko's house. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped and also had a full size fridge which was important to us since we stayed for two weeks. I'm not sure what people mean by it being in a sketchy neighborhood because it didn't feel unsafe to us at all. I will say that the smoke detectors are extremely sensitive so be careful what you cook on the stove. You can hear them walking around upstairs during the day but it was never late at night and never loud enough to bother. The apartment is super cozy and comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone! 
2586350,23957969,2014-12-15,23753751,Pearl,Very close to my adult children we were visiting. Loved the bed! Very quiet and clean.
2586350,26564315,2015-02-15,27338402,Cody,"Matt and Akiko's place was exactly what we were looking for, and they were very welcoming. We could not have asked for better hosts! The space was very clean, comfortable and private. Access to the light rail was awesome and made it very easy to get to anywhere in the Seattle area. The bed was super comfy and the kitchen was fully equipped and HBO was a bonus. We would definitely stay there again!"
2586350,27984924,2015-03-15,1696232,Amy,Very comfortable stay. It was clean and very quiet. I was able to stay on short notice and they were very accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.
2586350,28270148,2015-03-21,22019435,Kristine,We were only at the house for about 7 hours just to sleep. greeted by a very nice man named Mat.  Great host.  One of the beds was an air mattress and was chilly but the other bed was awesome.  Very clean place.  It met our needs.
2586350,28742114,2015-03-29,25883682,Erin,"We only stayed at Matt and Akiko's for one night, but it was an easy and pleasant time.  There was clear communication from the hosts, and we had complete autonomy to come and go as we pleased.  The basement apartment was pin-neat and anything we could have needed was made available.  Thank you!"
2586350,29738733,2015-04-12,343513,Rebecca,"Great space--comfortable and clean, close to transit, and lots of food options nearby (including a taco bus!). Matt and Akiko were flexible with our check in and check out times, which we really appreciated since we were traveling with our toddler. Nice place to stay!"
2586350,31214482,2015-05-03,30741721,Karl,"Matt and Akiko were very friendly and made my family and I feel welcome. They also went out of their way to help with big and little things. Everything we needed was provided for. When we discovered the owners were out of saran wrap in the awesome kitchen of the unit, Matt went out of his way by coming back from a friend's house just to hand-deliver some. By the way, Akiko helped us to find Pho and directions! Great service, nice people!"
2586350,32039161,2015-05-12,32768468,Katy,"Akiko and Matt were very welcoming, and did everything they could to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The space was clean, tidy, and comfortable, and we would definitely consider coming back the next time we're in Seattle. Thank you, Akiko and Matt!"
2586350,32222010,2015-05-15,21408584,David,Excellent stay. Like a private apartment. Hosts are super responsive.  Will stay again on my next trip down from Alaska.
2586350,32380030,2015-05-17,27993648,Jeanee,Akiko and Matt's place was perfect for meeting with my son and granddaughter in Seattle.  We stayed two nights with a all day trip to the zoo on the second day.  We were tired afterwards and enjoyed relaxing in the apartment.  There was plenty of room for my four-year-old granddaughter to play with her toys while we read.  The home was spotless and allowed us to stay in for dinner with the full kitchen.  
2586350,33142613,2015-05-25,28702282,Elke,"Die Unterkunft bei Akiko und Matt war genauso wie beschrieben, das Stadtzentrum ist superschnell mit dem light Train zu erreichen, so dass man für die Stadtbesichtigung kein Auto braucht. Akiko und Matt sind äußerst freundliche, aufmerksame und nette Gastgeber, wir haben zusammen einen gemütlichen Grillabend verbracht. In der Wohnung ist alles vorhanden, um erholsame Ferien zu verbringen. Wenn wir wieder einmal Seattle besuchen, kommen wir gerne wieder. Vielen Dank an Akiko und Matt !"
2586350,33978053,2015-06-03,18281209,Liz,"This place was perfect for 2.  It was exactly as described and had everything and more you could want in the kitchen and plenty of seating throughout. The bed was very comfortable and we had 4 great nights sleep. The hosts Matt and Akiko were there when we wanted them and very helpful. We used the light rail to go to a baseball game at night and it was fast, clean and cheap. Unfortunately the weather was not good while we were there and so we were unable to use the great deck and yard. Most enjoyable stay."
2586350,34728043,2015-06-11,31997951,Sarah,"My husband and I stayed for three nights as we were awaiting a flight to Japan. Matt met us as we arrived and let us into the room. Just as their advertisement says, they will have as much or as little interaction with you as you would like. When we took advantage of sitting on their beautiful deck, Matt came out and chatted with us. He provided great restaurant recommendations and was very personable. We did not get to meet Akiko, but we did meet their little girl and babysitter. The space itself is more than ample for two people, complete with kitchenette (everything except an oven), full bathroom and queen size bed. I can also vouch for the confines of the couch as I took a couple of naps there. The location is conveniently located near Columbia City which is filled with restaurants, little bakeries, and bars. You could walk if you had to but we chose to drive. Overall a great stay for our last couple of days in the States for awhile. Highly recommended."
2586350,35084442,2015-06-15,30738060,Madeleine,"My husband and I spent 3 nights hosted by Matt and Akiko.  The apartment exceeded our expectations.  The bed was superb, the neighborhood quiet, our hosts welcoming, accommodating and  gracious.  We shared wine on their beautiful deck with the fire pit ablaze and could have chatted for much longer.  We liked the accessibility to the light rail and buses (short walks). We would stay here again on our next trip to the Seattle area."
2586350,35323336,2015-06-17,34154312,Jennifer,"Matt and Akiko's place was terrific and perfect for our short stay in Seattle. The space was a perfect size for our family of four, the beds were comfortable and the decor was well appointed. We arrived the same time that Matt was coming home, and he was able to give us great recommendations for dinner (in addition they have put together a thorough guide of the local restaurants they recommend.) The house was perfectly located near the bus and light rail, so we were able to use public transportation exclusively with our two small kids, around their house, into Downtown Seattle and to the airport.  We were only disappointed that our busy sight-seeing days in Seattle did not leave us more time to get to know Matt and Akiko and enjoy an evening on their shared porch. We would absolutely recommend their house for your next stay in Seattle."
2586350,35802692,2015-06-22,16685800,Hsing Yi,We had a good time staying with Akiko and Matt.  They were very friendly and helped with all the questions&needs we had.  The room is very suitable for a family under 6 people.  The location is very convenient.  We highly recommend you to stay here when travel to Seattle. 
2586350,36072890,2015-06-24,36387892,Zhengjie,The place is clean and comfortable! Got the place for my family when they came to visit and they were delighted. Friendly hosts even though we didn't get to interact much as we were out most of the time. 
2586350,36682265,2015-06-30,5024231,Marianne,"The best part of this Airbnb experience was the opportunity of meeting Matt and Akiko who shared their home with us.  They could not have been more gracious and welcoming. 

Here are just some of the other reasons you should stay here:
Immaculate - nicely appointed - comfortable despite the outside high temps - best mattress and pillows - close proximity to ""Link"". We could not have found a better place to stay.

Seattle appeared to be hillier than San Francisco, our home. We are happy we made this our choice because the hills could become a burden to climb to see the city. The Link brought us right into the action.  Tip for Seniors - order an ORCA card for $3 before you leave home dropping your transportation costs to $1 instead of $2.50. The Link can pick you up at the airport and makes several convenient stops along the way ending at the base of the Monorail, downtown. No need to rent a car.

In addition to socializing with Matt and Akiko, we met other happy travelers staying there who shared their travel stories with us. We want to thank Matt and Akiko for making their apartment available to us."
2586350,37012345,2015-07-03,3272116,Michael,Super clean and nice little place. The hosts have pretty much everything you'd need and it's really a place you can feel at home at.  The bed is great too! The apartment does get a little too warm in the summer but host said he'd address it. Matt is a very nice guy and good communicator as well!
2586350,38428715,2015-07-15,35868480,John,"Akiko and Matt are the nicest host you'll ever meet. They met us at check-in. Introduced themselves and were nice and offer any assistance if necessary. We chatted briefly and then headed out. Nice, modern and spacious place. Very clean. Plenty of parking. Would definitely stay again should so find myself in Seattle. Thanks Akiko and Matt!!!"
2586350,38581395,2015-07-17,27851515,Doris,"The Appartement was very nice, clean and well equipped. It provided us with everything  we needed for a great Start of our family holiday. Thanks!"
2586350,38925610,2015-07-19,37940027,Detria,"Arriving at their home, it was very cute and quiet. The basement apartment was nicely furnished, cozy and very comfortable. 
since I wanted to make some home cooked meals for my guest, I was pleased with the size of the kitchen and all the tools they had available. Proximity to the airport was also a plus because traffic can be crazy. 
All in all I loved it and would recommend it to anyone. "
2586350,39445835,2015-07-23,38556962,Kelley,"The apartment was very warm and welcoming, exactly what we were looking for.  We have 3 children under 5 and we all felt very comfortable in the space. The backyard was perfect for our kids. Great location with parks close by and the light rail. Plenty of street parking. 
If your looking for a great breakfast check out Geraldine's Counter!!
Akiko and Matt were great to talk too!
"
2586350,40084707,2015-07-28,25866195,Denny,"The place is exactly as advertised. Absolutely perfect! Both the queen sized bed and air mattress were extremely comfortable. It's about  a 8 minute walk to the train which takes you downtown and can even take you right to the airport. Place is awesome for sports fans as it's about a 10-15 min ride to safeco and century link field.

Place in nicely furnished and I did not hear a peep from the hosts upstairs during our 5 night stay. Highly recommend staying here Matt was very welcoming when we arrived. 
"
2586350,41074749,2015-08-04,9773116,Lisa,"What a lovely stay.  Short of providing great weather (which was perfect, by the way), Matt and Akiko did everything to ensure a cozy, comfortable stay for myself, husband and two older teens. 
Even before we arrived, Matt was in communication with me about a water festival nearby that we shouldn't miss!
  You can tell a lot of thought and preparation went into the apartment from the full kitchen, eating area and living area to the cleanliness of the entire place.
The apartment was a great home base for all of our wanderings in Seattle and we would highly recommend it to anyone who is visiting the area.

Thanks, Matt and Akiko!

  "
2586350,42301067,2015-08-12,36350529,Monika,"Akiko and Matt were fantastic hosts! They were prompt in responding to our inquiries and easy to communicate with, which was very helpful throughout the planning process. They have created a wonderful setting for travelers and we felt at home instantly. It was so great to have a clean, comfortable, organized space to come back to after exploring the city. The deck is also a great part of the home we enjoyed. 

While the location is not in the city center, but easily accessible, it was a pleasant to be in a neighborhood outside of the hectic touristy streets. Other reviews were slightly misleading to us in regards to the surroundings; the neighborhood is extremely diverse but in no way unsafe. We never felt it was an issue to walk around and explore. In fact, walking to nearby Columbia City was a pleasant experience and we really enjoyed that part of town for it's eclectic vibe and great dining scene. However, we are city dwellers, so that is our perspective. 

Akiko and Matt are very friendly and kind hosts, which made us feel at ease. We are so thankful they have chosen to welcome travellers to their lovely space! We look forward to returning soon!"
2586350,43031974,2015-08-17,16067361,Erin,Loved it! It was better than the photos. Matt and Akiko were very sweet and welcoming. 
2586350,44141698,2015-08-24,13165913,Marda,"A BIG thank you to Matt and Akiko for our wonderful stay! This was our first airbnb experience and we are now hooked.  Our hosts were wonderful, friendly and accommodating.  The apt was clean, roomy and comfortable in every way.  We had everything we needed and more.  I  really appreciated the very comfortable bed and excellent bedding.  We asked for advice on where to buy a backpack and Matt quickly volunteered one of his for the duration of our trip.  Thank you so much for everything!!!"
2586350,45075858,2015-08-31,17938200,Ryan,"This was actually the second time we stayed here, unfortunately I didn't know about the time limit on airbnb reviews last time. The location is perfect if you don't want to be downtown but only a short drive/light rail ride away. The space itself is clean, and though we only spent a few hours there each day we all found it to be very relaxing to come back to after our busy days."
2586350,45588089,2015-09-04,40692521,Loyd,This home was comfortable and clean.  We enjoyed the TempurPedic bed since that's what we have in our home.  The Link ride into town was about 20 minutes and was an easy walk from the house.  A grocery store nearby provided us with all we needed for meals.  The hosts were gracious and allowed us our own privacy.
2586350,45955676,2015-09-07,11294897,Margaret,"We loved our stay in Seattle, it's a great apartment fully equipped with absolutely everything you need and more!  It's a very easy 10 minute walk to the Light Rail and takes about 30 mins to get into the city centre $2.75 single journey and 20 mins to the airport.  It was wonderfully quiet. Our hosts were lovely,  they quickly realised that we were pretty tired after 24 hrs of travel and no luggage! They made sure we had everything we needed, it was really lovely to be offered a glass of wine and receive a full bottle of local Washington wine,  it was fab and so unexpected but very much appreciated. We could easily have spent a week at this location. (Shampoo, shower gels, coffee tea,  toilet and kitchen roll all top quality)"
2586350,46759679,2015-09-13,12786170,Holly,"We were warmly welcomed and had very helpful advice on location and getting around. We slept 4 adults comfortably, but didn't stick around the house much...we had full days in the city! The walk to the train was a solid 10 minutes (so consider weather and how many bags you have to carry)...and the ride on the train was about the same. It was perfect for us to see the city on foot before we left on an Alaskan cruise...but the ideal situation to enjoy and explore Seattle would for sure be to have a car! 

There was a very quick and easy laundromat right next to train station that we utilized on our way out...also close grocery and Starbucks and great Chinese food in shopping center near train! We didn't explore any other walkable areas in this neighborhood.  But did enjoy a nice breakfast on the beautiful deck one sunny morning. Thanks, guys! Would love to come back!"
2586350,47426957,2015-09-18,43894609,Tammy,"It was a decent, quiet little apartment; older, but clean.  The neighborhood was also older...  a few shabby houses here and there and a lot of remodeling.  It wasn't as close to the light rail as I'd hoped it was, but it wasn't a ridiculous distance; still walkable, albeit I wouldn't walk it after dark.      "
2586350,47755065,2015-09-21,18217159,Luisa,Amazing!!! It was a wonderful weekend gateway!! we loved every moment there! they were so welcoming and comforting and just great!!! I highly recommend them!!! 
2586350,48014399,2015-09-22,1427220,Julie,"Akiko & Matt's place was very nice. The apartment setting was as described and very welcoming. They went out of their way to let us arrive early and leave our luggage ahead of check in time. Everything you need is there! It is just a couple blocks from light rail into city or to airport. It is a bit outside of the city, so about 15-20 minute train or can/uber ride. It was a great place to just relax after a long day walking around downtown. "
2586350,48763403,2015-09-28,1426463,Nancy,"Matt and Akiko have created a lovely, cozy and very comfortable space.  A light rail train station is conveniently located nearby for fast, cheap trips into Seattle. We would recommend this very pleasant place."
2586350,50198923,2015-10-10,1470914,Garrett,"Akiko and Matt are some honestly nice people.  They were super helpful during our stay of over a week for a family of four.

Our needs were easily met by being close to the light rail for traveling into downtown Seattle or to SEA airport.  UberX never cost more than $20USD to get into Seattle downtown or back, either.  So getting around without the light rail was a snap.

We cooked almost every night at the residence.  There are some great markets in the area; not to mention grocery delivery was a breeze using Instacart and Amazon Fresh and Prime Now.

Evening entertainment was easily covered by streaming video over internet and using their large TV.  Our privacy was also enjoyed as our young kids have nap times and go to bed early."
2586350,55225973,2015-11-29,47232338,Bryant,"This was a very nice, crisply clean and well appointed abb.  Very highly recommended.  We only briefly met the hosts because we were not around much.  But they mad it clear they would help in any way we needed it.  We will return."
7547290,45545368,2015-09-03,2905560,Louis,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Cristina and Elizabeth were very responsive, friendly and accommodating. The place is very clean, hip and comfortable, and they included a ton of thoughtful amenities to make us feel welcome. We had plenty of privacy to come and go as we pleased, combined with hosts nearby who answered our questions and gave us great tips about walks and restaurants in the neighborhood. It's a great place and we'll definitely come back next time we're in town!
"
7547290,46234394,2015-09-08,11107657,Stella,"We had a wonderful time staying at Cristina's apartment. The space was clean and comfortable, and was a perfect place to get a good night's sleep after long days exploring Seattle. Despite arriving later than we anticipated, Cristina greeted us late in the night after our long drive from California and showed us around. We loved being 15 minutes away from all the destinations we visited as well; Cristina was also wonderful in giving us many recommendations. We were a group of friends who were only in the apartment in the nights and the mornings and spent most of our time around Seattle: this is the perfect apartment for travelers of that sort. Thank you for your hospitality and we hope to stay again the next time we are in town! :) "
7547290,47429877,2015-09-18,20448298,Jeff,"As advertised. Everything is as nice as it looks in the photos. Plus Christina put out other nice things like chocolate, tea, coffee, etc. Keyless entry is a nice feature. One less thing for me to carry. I would absolutely stay here again."
7547290,47822593,2015-09-21,31935459,Jesse,Such a great place to stay! Loved the Cute and modern decor. So comfortable! The beds were so comfortable I asked after where the mattresses were from. They provide everything and anything you need from snacks to an umbrella. They even provide Netflix. Very helpful hosts and able to provide advice on things to see and eat. Safe location that was a short drive away from downtown and Capitol Hill. 
7547290,49647441,2015-10-05,2206985,Bo,Cristina was a great host! She was very accommodating and responded quickly to every question we had. Their basement apartment was perfect for my family! The space was very clean and you can tell a lot of thought and planning went into everything. We felt right at home. This is a great place to stay we will definitely be repeat visitors on our next visits to Seattle. 
7547290,50490441,2015-10-12,43826843,Hannah,"The place was great! Very clean and neat, with lots of little amenities! I'd definitely recommend this place. A very quiet neighborhood with nice restaurants and bars just a 10-15 minute walk away.  And Seward Park is a beautiful park to run or walk around!"
7547290,51937622,2015-10-25,45085205,Bea,"Privacy, cleanliness, considerate.  The place worked perfect for us.  The neighborhood was fun.  Enjoyed the local places such as the Union Bar (10% discount for union members), Rookies & Lotties.

Christina & Elizabeth were very attentive to our requests.  

Truth, as they said, if you don't like steps, this is not the place for you.  However, if you don't like steps, Seattle is not the place for you.  If you are not going up hill or climbing steps, you are not in Seattle. 

I give them 5 stars although Kitchen area is short a sink,  you can make due. We really used the space for a place to lay our heads, not as a hang out.  

I would certainly consider (website hidden) - You need a masters degree to figure out the  Seattle recycling rules. :) "
7547290,52250334,2015-10-27,184880,Robert,"Great new space, clean and stylish. Ideal airbnb experience, with zero complications. Not quite walking distance to the main area of Columbia City, but it's pretty close, and offers a lot of great restaurant options. Would definitely return. "
7547290,53002299,2015-11-03,25869503,Desiree,Gorgeous. Absolutely prefect. My 5 year old daughter was with me and she felt right at home the second we arrived. Modern and cozy. We are definitely coming back. Thank you for making our Seattle trip perfect. 
7547290,53521032,2015-11-09,7832817,Simon,All great :-) - thank you!
7547290,54274991,2015-11-17,38769068,Donata,Christina was very easy to communicate with as she accommodated my request of booking for two other guests. The place was comfortable and just like the pictures. It is definitely worth staying again.
7547290,54512683,2015-11-21,38382016,R.,"The apartment was immaculate, everything was new and pristine, very comfortable beds and linens. Cristina was helpful in organizing our arrival and stay. They were gracious when we had a delay in departure time which was greatly appreciated - even though it put them out. "
7547290,54735581,2015-11-23,12915769,Chris,"Lovely apartment, thoughtfully furnished with fun artwork. Superb communication with Christina throughout. Really well placed for Columbia City Theater. Highly recommended!"
7547290,55657519,2015-12-04,24304089,Greg,"Cristina emailed us to give us the code for the door and let us know that if we needed anything to let her know. 
The place was very comfortable although slightly lacking in kitchen amenities like a sink and the television was very limited but that really did not affect our stay. The neighborhood was good and plenty of places to eat and near public transportation."
7547290,56540554,2015-12-14,3306707,Jennifer,"This new apartment is bright and welcoming. The hosts made extra efforts to provide us with things we needed, and we're very conscientious. The neighborhood doesn't offer a lot of amenities, but there is a Starbucks drive through close by! "
486344,1576215,2012-06-27,2506845,Sin Yi,"The room is perfect and clean, and the traffic is also very convenience! I would like to go again if have chance!"
486344,1645241,2012-07-06,2739057,Molly,"Lara and David were very kind, fun, easy to get along with and hospitable. They gladly left the key for me to in a hidden location so that I may access the house while they were not home upon my arrival. The room was cozy and adequate for a short stay, and the house was very clean. They even have a dog, so if you're a dog lover, then you'll enjoy staying here!"
486344,1699607,2012-07-13,1164765,Vitaly,"My stay was pieceful and comfortable, although I only stayed two nights, and didn't get to see much of the city.  If your stay is brief, and you want to see the more diverse parts of Seattle, I would recommend chatting with Lara or David first - they are very friendly.  The 120 bus outside takes you straight downtown.  I would recommend using a bus tracking site to determine the arrival time, since it arrives once every 20 - 25 min."
486344,1721631,2012-07-16,2578619,David,"I was in town for a Wedding and needed a place to crash for the night. Ashley's basement room was perfect, and a great deal. Nice people to stay with!"
486344,1800127,2012-07-25,1619491,Lauren,"The room was very nice - the bed was comfy and cozy, and Lara was very friendly and made things easy on me (let me do a load of my laundry, keep things in the fridge, etc).  The hosts were out a lot - which made me feel like I often had the place to myself, which was great. 

It's a quick & easy bus ride into downtown, or to Alki Beach.  It's also very easy to take the lightrail & bus to/from the airport to the house - which can save you about $35 in cab fare.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. "
486344,1838958,2012-07-30,2698976,Kentaro,"I was in downtown Seattle for a conference this past week, and I was able to stay here for 5 days for the same price a hotel would have cost for one night. The house is 3 stories, clean and quite cool; the bus stop is a 30 second walk away and will get you to downtown in 15 minutes. Lara helped me get settled very quickly and helped me navigate Seattle (and the public transit system) throughout my visit. This is a great place to stay for anyone visiting the Seattle area. "
486344,1919785,2012-08-07,1643985,Uwe,"I had a great stay with Lara and David in Seattle for 3 days, with a car you can reach downtown in 12 Minutes. A good seperate room, interesting talks in the evening, I defenitly would come back. Thank you. "
486344,2011213,2012-08-17,1932054,Geri,"Lara and David were friendly and helpful.  Their place is delightful and clean - a 3 storey townhouse in West Seattle.  It lived up to its description and photos and is situated in a pretty, pleasant and quiet part of Seattle.  There are bus stops to downtown almost at the front door and Seattle is easy to nvaigate by foot and public transport.  It is easy to get to their place from either the Greyhound terminal or airport by public transport and quite inexpensive.  The waterfront and anywhere near the water in Seattle is beautiful and there is much to see and do.  Their place was quiet and due to their working odd shifts, they were not often there.  Even when they were, they spent most of their time on the third floor, so the place was always very quiet.  I have no hesitation in recommending their place to anyone who wishes to visit Seattle and if I ever returned, I would want to stay there again."
486344,2058950,2012-08-21,3195767,Phyllis,"Great quiet location, nice dog,  was there for three nights.   The dog owns the couch, but he'll share. "
486344,2153448,2012-08-31,3093261,Philipp,I stayed three days at Lara's place. The room was very comfy and it was a pleasure to talk with Lara.
486344,2440429,2012-09-28,3564269,Tina,"I stayed at this cute townhouse for a week. The room is small, but I don't really need much space either. Parking on the street, close to downtown and alki beach. David and Lara are very nice. The dogs are super sweet. The only thing that was a little disapponiting is the shared bathtube was clogged during the whole time I was there. It was really incomvenient. "
486344,3459550,2013-02-02,4650605,Soumya,"I just needed a simple room for 2 weeks when I moved to Seattle,  and Lara's place fit the bill perfectly. The hosts were gracious, and I can unreservedly recommend this place if you need a no frills place to lay your head."
486344,3597836,2013-02-20,5100133,New,"My trip to Seattle was very short notice. I was literally at the airport trying to find a place to stay. Lara's place was a great find. Affordable, quaint and cozy the room is separated from the rest of the house, so I could come and go as a pleased without having to worry about disturbing anyone. (The room also has its own thermostat, for those chilly Seattle nights) Lara and David were also very nice and respectable. The bus stop was half a block away. The ride into downtown and all the tourist attractions was just 15 minutes. Highly recommended. You must be a dog lover."
486344,3810623,2013-03-17,5370037,Justin,Lara and David are great. Photos and description are very accurate. The room was perfect for my needs. 
486344,4788017,2013-05-26,5863783,Benjamin,"When it came to move 700 miles away to Seattle, I stumbled into this room offering while my own rental opened up.   Great location right in West Seattle with easy access to the freeway (and to top it off there's a great local coffee shop very close by).  
The house and neighborhood were very quiet, I never had an issue getting a good nights sleep (and this is over the course of 3 weeks).  The 2 pups are well behaved and friendly, and while the room is not as large as some, it's plenty big enough and cozy.

Lara and David were great to rent from, was a great experience."
486344,5227227,2013-06-19,3231683,Zhihan,The room is nice and quiet as its description. Lara and David are really nice and it was pleasant stay.

486344,6056037,2013-07-28,7408853,Chris,"Lara and David were excellent hosts. I stayed in their private room for 7 days and it was everything that I needed. The location is great, close to downtown, a block from direct public transportation to anywhere you'd want to go, and West Seattle is a nice little area to explore as well. The room was clean and large enough for my needs. No need to think twice about staying with Lara and David in West Seattle! "
486344,6122205,2013-07-30,6851246,Max,David was a fantastic host; the accommodation was very welcoming! Perfect position to visit seattle; easy ride to towndown (15min); awesome coffee and muffins are guaranteed in the neighborhood cafe  :-) everytime again!!
486344,7609339,2013-09-26,8759720,Michelle,"Lara and David are such awesome and chill people. Very accommodating and super friendly. The place is at a great location if you need to commute to downtown Seattle by bus. And not to forget their awesome dog, Carlo! "
486344,7855678,2013-10-06,325837,John,"I was very pleased to stay with Lara and David in North Delridge for about 10 days.  Their location is about 20 minutes from either downtown Seattle or Burien depending on which way you choose to go on the 120 Metro bus.  Within short walking distance, I could reach either of two coffee shop, two mini-markets, and a well maintained Vietnamese restaurant.  As for my room, I found it to be very adequate for my needs.  It was quiet and easily warmed up by using the wall thermostat.  The WiFi did need to be restarted occasionally but this was easily achieved by unplugging the router upstairs.  I was especially impressed by Scarlet who occasionally came to clean the apartment.  She was very thorough.  "
486344,8753736,2013-11-16,3599975,Barbara,"My stay went well.  I was only there in the evening and all was very quiet.  I missed getting to meet Lara.  It is in a residential area, a distance from resteruants and stores...a car would be helpful but the bus is nearby.  "
486344,16754469,2014-08-01,7879551,Allen,"Amazing amazing amazing place to stay for nights!!
The place is so clean and comfy!
Check in was easy , and they have a lovely dog!!
Totally recommend it !"
486344,18725855,2014-08-31,17827124,Joe,"Clean, comfortable, good hosts. Great location for commute downtown.  Quiet neighborhood. Good experience for my first airbnb."
486344,19042664,2014-09-05,9410271,Andrea,"Lara and David were very nice, helpful, and welcoming. Lara communicated well beforehand. Carlo, the dog, is a love. A half hour trip to downtown but bus service is good and close. Interesting to be in a real residential neighbourhood. Bed is good- slept like a log."
486344,23189050,2014-11-24,10372721,Matthew,Had a great time at Laura-Ashley's place and everything went smoothly. Dog is super nice. :) 
486344,28622629,2015-03-27,2424785,Brian,"Immensely enjoyed my time with Lara and her roommate. The house is very nice, they're very friendly and quiet! The room is advertised and the bed is as comfy as you could imagine. Also, Carlo (their dog) is amazing! Would definitely recommend. "
486344,29075241,2015-04-03,11611334,Liz,Lara-Ashley was a wonderful host. The room was cozy and quiet and the bed was comfortable. The toilet was right at the top of the stairs on the second level. The full bath was on the third level. I would definitely stay again and I would highly recommend it for others.
486344,29715280,2015-04-11,27173837,Neil,"It was a great time! Lara and David were very cool! Just nice people. The room was great, it was all I needed. Thanks guys!"
486344,29897019,2015-04-13,27173837,Neil,"What a great experience! Laura and Dave are super cool people, very laid back. Carlo the dog is sweet. The room was perfect and comfortable. It was all I needed:) I highly recommend!"
486344,30163230,2015-04-18,843802,Ryan,"I had to come in very late and Lara was very accommodating. My trip involved early raising and late nights. So really I just slept there. That being said, the room was well taken care of and quiet. I would stay there again. "
486344,30346954,2015-04-20,27173837,Neil,"Another great experience, would stay again for sure! Thanks guys!"

486344,30651105,2015-04-25,27713736,Jeramy,It's a great place to stay. Would stay again. Very comfortable with amenities.  
486344,32259468,2015-05-16,22667149,Li Ming,Pretty comfortable room
486344,32442049,2015-05-17,2722163,Gordon,"Lara was very welcoming, friendly and just a perfect all around host. My first experience and won't be my last. Place was very clean and organized, cute friendly puppy and easy to get to. The day bed is large (I'm 6'3"" and fit just fine) and comfortable. Highly recommended for staying just outside the city only 5 min from downtown. You'll definitely see me again :)"
486344,40671666,2015-08-01,15620,Elizabeth,"Lara was kind and welcoming; she answered all my questions and made me feel at home.  It was bonus having the half-bath upstairs to myself (had not expected that!).  The room is small but comfortable and conducive to a good night's sleep; I do wish there had been a desk lamp for the desk, however.  There are little fans that help keep the room fresh & airy.  Parking is good, the apartment is easy to find, and the wireless connection easy & seamless.  Lara was really nice & lent me her travel iron; also I was able store my food in her fridge, which had plenty of space.  The Ritz it ain't, but quite OK for my needs & the price is certainly right.  Thanks Lara! "
486344,44634868,2015-08-28,25086210,Rowena,"The listing was accurate, my room is very peaceful and I have a lot of privacy to myself. The sheets and covers are better looking than in the picture. It's very convenient to commute from this place, at least I find many major bus lines that run through right in front of this house. The kitchen is huge and you have your own bathroom (with no shower, however). Shower is shared. Their dog Carlo is extremely friendly and it was a good stay."
486344,44970582,2015-08-30,36980701,Usua U.,"This was quite a nice visit. The home was easy to find, and more importantly, very comfortable. I was welcomed upon arrival, and shown around. The room was situated in the home such that I came and went without much hassle and any thought of bothering the hosts. The dog was quite large, yet very friendly. If you are looking for a quiet, nice place to stay while in Seattle, I highly recommend this listing.  "
486344,45348306,2015-09-01,2469295,Lee,Nice place to stay. Great price for close location on bus line to downtown Seattle. Thanks
486344,46084379,2015-09-07,2208939,Bill,Great room with easy access to West Seattle. Felt very comfortable from the moment I got there.
486344,47793365,2015-09-21,43165040,Mariela,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and a great one. Lara was super friendly and accommodating. The room is quiet and comfortable.  And if you happen to like dogs: they have the sweetest one!"
486344,48934754,2015-09-29,22882728,Natalia,"Lara Ashley's place was great! She was quick to respond to any of my questions and made the check in process super fast and easy even though I got in late at night. The room as well as the rest of the house were nice and clean and just as described. The bus stop was less than a minute walk away so that was really convenient for me since I didn't have car around. Overall a great place to stay, I would recommend it to anyone traveling solo to Seattle!"
486344,49374834,2015-10-03,3085478,Alice,"Lara was so friendly and welcoming! The room was very nice and I had my privacy since the main living space was upstairs. She had everything provided and the bus stop is only half a block away from the house. Not a bad commute to downtown Seattle if you're looking to live in a cheap place close to the city. Only thing to note is that you should load up your Orca card (public transport) since there aren't any locations nearby and the website takes at least 24 hrs. 

Overall, I'd definitely stay again and would recommend Lara and her beautiful house!"
486344,50052456,2015-10-08,28350320,Deandra,"Laura was east to reach once we got in touch, quick to respond. The place was nice, clean and private being on the first floor. Had everything I needed. Carlos the dog was really chill. It was a quick and easy bus ride into downtown, also was able to walk a ways (nice neighborhood walk) to get to some good food and music. Great view of the city from the top of the hill a couple miles out. "
9368677,57949549,2015-12-30,51550616,Susan,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a delightful one!  This basement daylight apartment described as ""cozy"" is also quite spacious.  It is modern, has a complete kitchen and very comfortable beds.  It is in prime location and we would walk downtown almost every day and then either take the bus or Uber back.  It's difficult to walk more than 3 blocks in any direction without comping upon a coffee house, bakery, trattoria, bar or some wonderful little restaurant.    Our hosts were very gracious and offered any help that we needed to get around the city or to know what sort of places of interest were near by.  "
9863484,56572621,2015-12-14,13507084,Timm,"perfect little place, clean and warm, just perfect for crashing after a rainy day in this beautiful city."
9863484,56975808,2015-12-20,318764,Michael,"Great experience! Although kind of last minute, still good choice. Joy was great, very comforting presence. Great location for anything near downtown or the space needle. Recommend to any visitor of the Emerald City. "
4384000,57810604,2015-12-29,1378717,Casey,"The house is beautiful and in a nice neighborhood. There is a great view from the living room and from the master upstairs. The listing states that there are 4 beds and that it accommodates 5 people, but we only found 3 beds(a king and two twin beds). Micheal was friendly and walked me through using the tv/cable set up and thermostat use, though for future guests it would be nice to have written notes for things like that."
3666970,17303557,2014-08-10,1309274,Marti,"A lovely old 3 story home in Capital Hill! Leah was very warm and welcoming and was very thorough in explaining the layout of the house. She responded very quickly to emails and texts and answered all my questions. An extremely great deal if you are looking to stay in this very affluent area of Seattle. Although not very close to convenience stores, the busline is very close. If you are on a budget and want to experience Seattle like a native, I would definitely recommend Leah and Michael's place. "
3666970,17466223,2014-08-12,17822404,Rachel,"I didn't meet Michael but rest of roommates were great. One even loaned me her bike for the weekend. 
The space is really nice, large rooms. Lots of people coming and going but well organized and noise wasn't an issue. The big sunny kitchen was well stocked w staples which made cooking meals so much easier. Fun neighborhood, easy to get to and from by transit. Would definitely recommend. "
3666970,17892900,2014-08-18,12272043,Byron,Had a good time here. 
3666970,18808413,2014-09-01,3942411,Alan,"The house was amazing! I wasn't expecting there to be as many people in the house, I didn't know it was so big! But everyone that we met was really great. The house was really easy to find, a little more of a hike to town, but not bad for a long walk to capitol hill. 
The room was extremely clean, as was the rest of the shared spaces in the house. 
Leah even dropped off Donuts on Saturday morning! Thanks!!
All correspondence was quick and helpful!"
3666970,31142892,2015-05-02,7693924,Drew,Delightful as always.  
3666970,34085796,2015-06-04,33141977,Matthew,"As a first time traveler to Seattle, I found this airbnb most suitable for my three day sightseeing agenda and overnight needs. Even though I never met Leah, she diligently contacted me to ensure my stay was well accommodated, comfortable, and seamless from start to finish.  Ultimately, you can expect outdated house decor, but up-to-date, earnest, and friendly house mates who want to elevate your Seattle experience. 

Travelers Notes: I found the public transportation to be second rate and frustrating compared to Portland, but Uber was effective and efficient.  "
3666970,38223597,2015-07-13,14838505,Penglu,It was a great experience to live with so many people. It's like a big family. The room is clean and people are really nice. The hint paper is stick on the wall which is really clear. Love this place!
3666970,40629297,2015-08-01,37566028,Libby,"A home away from home - great people, great stories, comfortable living space and a hella good time had."
3666970,41940202,2015-08-10,33324142,Conor,"So i planed to stay for one week and then move on but my plans fell through,  they where kind enough to give me some extra day to sort myself out and move one, was super helpful.  The house is great the people are cool and everything you couldn't want is walking distance"
3666970,42743801,2015-08-15,39710662,Johannah,"I wasn't around much, but everyone was nice and helpful. Everything was just as described and I'll definitely stay here again if I need a short term place in Seattle. This is also a great neighborhood for running. The Arboretum is nearby for trail runners, and there are some killer hills on the surrounding streets. "
3666970,43412293,2015-08-19,36477868,Greta,"This was my first Airbnb, and in such a group-y kind of setting, I was understandably a little anxious before I arrived. But once I did arrive, everyone was friendly and easy to talk to, and even helped me get my things in and gave me a tour of the house. I was unable to go to the Saturday night bonfire because I had to work late, so unfortunately I missed out on most of the social aspect of staying at the Crayola house, but I was able to chat with a few of the roommates and temporary guests when we bumped into each other in the kitchen or in the common spaces. I really had no idea what to expect, sharing a room with 4 other people, but everyone in my room was so quiet and considerate. My bunk was clean and comfy and I slept like a rock! This was a really cool experience, thanks!"
3666970,43855208,2015-08-22,17182109,Kai,"Amazing guys! Couldn't have asked for a better spot. Thank you, everything was clean, neighbourhood was incredible, people at the house where cool. Would stay with you again in a heartbeat!"
3666970,45370647,2015-09-02,33325911,Braden,"I was made very welcome by the host, the house was kept in good order.
The listing was accurate, one minor thing is the image shows a bottom bunk which does not exist, there is a top bunk which was fine for me.
The neighborhood was nice, lots of trees and hills, there is a good amount of public transport (be sure to check the transit planner), the people were very kind and helpful when asked."
3666970,46617392,2015-09-12,40808121,Joel,"Great house, great atmosphere, I spent time in both green and purple room and I preferred the green room. It has carpeted floors and more space. The purple room is a little more claustrophobic and roommates can easily wake you up throughout the night. Other than that, the experience was great. A cool mixture of long term renters and hostelers. Thanks Leah!  "
3666970,50250822,2015-10-10,29598669,Kari,"The house is in a great location on a nice quiet street, and the guests inside are warm and weloming."
3666970,55629360,2015-12-03,47713859,Victoria,The home was very welcoming. It was the perfect place to crash after spending the day in seattle. Mostly I was left to my own accord which works well for me. The room was as pictured. The dorms are a bit tight on space but nothing too crazy. If you like a lot of space though I would recommend a private room
2487892,11251068,2014-03-26,3903108,Petra,"I was Lauren and Martin's first AirBnB guest and it was really great staying with them. Their house is in a superb location with a super short walk to one of the best neighborhoods (Ballard) in Seattle. Lauren and Martin are great, always ready to help and answer any questions. I stayed for almost 2 weeks, so it was great to also use their washer and dryer. The room and bathroom are on the bottom floor where you enter the house, so you kind of have your own area, if you like some privacy. The room has a nice futon bed, a closet and while it's not super big, it's definitely good for 2 people. The bathroom is really nice. In fact the whole house is really nice and pretty new. Stay there. you won't regret it! :)"
2487892,11556723,2014-04-07,12202349,Susan,"Location, location, location!  If you are staying in Ballard this is the perfect location.  You are right off Market Street and everything is easily walkable, tons of bars, restaurants, the movie theater, and the QFC grocery store.  Martin and Lauren live upstairs so you have plenty of privacy downstairs with your own bedroom, bathroom, and patio.  The only minor drawback was the curtains in the room, they were not room darkening and since I was coming from a completely different time zone it would have been nice or it to be a little darker when I wanted to nap.  Lauren is very friendly and made me feel welcome."
2487892,11704955,2014-04-12,14100034,Bryan,"Martin and Lauren were very nice to let me relax and hang out until it was time for the little one to go to bed. Then I went out to get dinner in downtown Ballard, which provides a great selection of dinning possibilities. Fantastic location, very friendly hosts. Who could ask for more?"
2487892,11821484,2014-04-15,14135853,Sheena,Perfect location and lovely hosts.. The room is great for anyone looking for an affordable room in Ballard. I was within walking distance of anything and was able to come and go as I wanted. Had a great weekend because I had such fantastic accommodations. Thanks Lauren and Martin! 
2487892,12623223,2014-05-06,2619293,Florence,"I had a great stay at Martin & Lauren's recently! 
Lauren welcomed me on the day of my arrival and made sure that I felt comfortable in their home. The room (which opens on a quiet little private patio) is fully furnished, very comfy (great bed) and spacious enough to contain all of your belonging. There's a nice and clean adjacent bathroom for the guest's use only. 
The place is located only steps away from delicious restaurants and boutiques. I really like Ballard, it's like no other places I've ever been to.
For a first time in Seattle, I could not ask for more. I wish I could have spent some time with my hosts and get to know more about the locals but I brought work with me and needed privacy--they respected that.
I definitely recommend that place!"
2487892,12864735,2014-05-12,2773816,Rachel,"Very comfortable and clean bedroom and bathroom to yourself, separate from the main part of the house. Martin & Lauren are very gracious and accommodating and their toddler is adorable :) It is so easy to walk to the central part of Ballard and to take the bus to downtown Seattle, which I did several times. Street parking for my rental car was so easy! I parked right across the street from their house. I highly recommend this listing!"
2487892,12912226,2014-05-13,6904797,Maria,"I had a nice stay on Martin & Lauren's 1st floor.  Sleep was very peaceful and I got to stretch and eat in the backyard.  They are also great hosts, working with my plans and being comfortable yet giving me a bubble of space."
2487892,13034666,2014-05-18,11175470,Monique,"We only stayed two nights at Martin and Lauren, but we found the accomodation comfortable, and as described. I would only like to add, that, although it did not bother us, there were two cats that came in and out of our room, and it might not be a good place for people allergic to cats.
Monique Davies"
2487892,13211783,2014-05-22,13544524,Melanie,"Really enjoyed my first Airbnb stay! Lauren and Martin were kind, friendly, and flexible with my travel schedule. Their house is on a quiet street within walking distance of a lot of great stuff in Ballard, and I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. If you're apartment hunting in Ballard, like I was, you don't need to rent a car: this location has really convenient access to downtown Ballard, a grocery store, and a bus stop. I'm wary of futons, but this one slept 2 people quite comfortably."
2487892,13278616,2014-05-24,1002812,Jessica,"Martin and Lauren's condo was really convenient to all of the places we wanted to visit.  The space for Airbnb guests is private - a 3/4 bath and bedroom - and has access to a little patio.  Lauren was flexible and easy to be in touch with about arriving and departing.  All in all, a really pleasant stay with nice people.  As others have noted -- there are two cats so if you are allergic this might not be the place for you!  A great first Airbnb experiene for us.  "
2487892,13362073,2014-05-26,14656526,Frances,Martin and Lauren's place was great! Very clean and has easy private access to the room. A perfect location to stay while spending time in Ballard!
2487892,13510085,2014-05-29,7526117,Isa,"We really enjoyed to stay at Martin's & Lauren's place. The room had a big french window with access to the nice terrace.Most of all we liked To stay close to the the area of Ballard, where you can find a plenty of Cafés, bars and shops. Also the Place is not too far away from the buslines which bring you To the City Center. Highly recommended!!"
2487892,13838378,2014-06-05,175397,Rosemary,"My friend and I were heading to Ballard for a concert and booked Martin & Lauren's place last minute.  It was smaller than I expected, but it was comfy, cozy and just what we needed.  Having a private bathroom was great, and the patio was a real bonus.  The cats were curious about us so did visit a fair bit, but we didn't mind so left the door open.
Lauren was flexible with our check in/out and communication with her was a breeze.  We were given our own key so we could come in and out on our own accord which was great.  I will definitely keep this spot in mind for future one or two night stays."
2487892,13868654,2014-06-06,1243429,Henry,"Great place to stay. The location is awesome if you want to be in Ballard: just off Market St, and a very short walk to Ballard Ave. Plenty of on-street parking nearby. The room was small but nice, with a private bathroom. We would be happy to stay here again."
2487892,13913711,2014-06-08,442477,Michele,This was a great place to stay! Super clean and comfortable and the location made it really easy to get to Ballard. 
2487892,16409053,2014-07-27,16249214,Martin,"Everything was just as on the photos. The place is situated really central to everything you'd want out of Ballard; good food, good coffee and good bars."
2487892,16560500,2014-07-29,13859617,Grace,"Lauren was a gracious host and was flexible with our arrival time. The room was clean and tidy as pictured. In addition, it was walking distance to a lot of great restaurants in the Ballard area (The Walrus & the Carpenter, La Isla, & Ballard Pizza Company just to name a few). While the futon was comfortable and is easily able to accommodate two, my boyfriend who is over 6' found that the futon was a bit short in length. He managed though :)"
2487892,16898341,2014-08-04,6823169,Shelley,"Martin and Lauren were welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the coziness of the room encouraged us to explore.  Ballard is a fun and interesting neighborhood, walking distance away.  The #40 bus took us easily to the more touristy areas."
2487892,17008313,2014-08-05,10139025,Anwar,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience for the day we stayed at Martin's listing. The room was very clean and comfortable. Also the listing was in a great location, walking distance from cool shops and bars, as well as a very short drive to the beach."
2487892,17505126,2014-08-13,4015775,Harley,"Great hosts, super accommodating, and very friendly. The space was totally private, superbly located and close to transit.

I'd absolutely stay there again."
2487892,18006960,2014-08-20,5355949,Amy,"Our stay at Lauren and Martin's place was nice. The room and bathroom were exactly what we were expecting. It's a good place to stay if you're planning on spending most of your time outside, exploring Seattle. "
2487892,18211069,2014-08-23,13663455,Michael,"My partner and I stayed for 2 nights at this location. The Ballard neighborhood is definitely up and coming - with many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars in the area within walking distance; however, if you would like to go downtown it can take some time without a car. To be fair, we didn't use public transportation, we rented a car. If you intend to rent a car parking is fantastic and free around the area - we had no issues regardless of the time of day. The room was as advertised, very clean and neat, the host Lauren was very warm, friendly, flexible, and easygoing. The room was on the main floor and we felt as though we had our own private apartment with a patio. Would absolutely stay with them again! "
2487892,18726254,2014-08-31,9504277,Ana,I had a great experience at Lauren and Martin's listing. The room is private and über clean and their house is centrally located in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood - within 3 minutes from a cute coffee shop and bus stop that takes you downtown. There are also other restaurants and shops within walking distance. Lauren and Martin were wonderful and accommodating hosts. I would definitely stay here again. 
2487892,19798003,2014-09-18,118675,Maiwenn,"We really had a great time at Martin's place. Martin and Lauren were really friendly, and ready to help us. The house is located in a great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and bars. The bedroom is clean and the bed confortable, the private bathroom is a big plus. We stayed 3 nights and I will definately stay again !"
2487892,19953868,2014-09-21,8267428,Sarah,"Martin and Lauren were wonderful hosts and have a great setup in Ballard. It's a cozy room- perfect for one or two people. The fun hip vibe of Ballad is a couple of blocks in one direction and the Chittenden Locks are a couple of blocks in the other (definitely worth a visit!). If you're active, we recommend getting a hold of bikes (Martin and Lauren graciously let us borrow theirs in exchange for putting a little TLC into them!).  Crossing the locks with your bike can take you into downtown (about 6 miles) or the Burke-Gilman trail in the other direction can take you into Fremont/ Gas works Park/ University Village. I can't think of a better spot for base camp in a Seattle visit!"
2487892,20431396,2014-09-29,2487915,Bela,Martin and Loren were wonderful hosts. They gave me very useful information about vegetarian restaurants; recommendation where to go nearby in this interesting part of Seattle. The house was clean and very well kept and the neighborhood was nice.
2487892,21130001,2014-10-12,20035427,Irena,"I had a great stay- Martin & Lauren were awesome hosts. The room was just as I expected, super cozy, and it's right near gorgeous downtown Ballard and public transportation. "
2487892,21770965,2014-10-23,3815986,Julia,"We had a nice two-night stay at Martin and Laura's place. The room is perfect if you are exploring the neighbourhood and Seattle. Ballard is really nice, has a lot of good restaurants and good bus connections to Downtown Seattle. "
2487892,21970670,2014-10-27,1770033,Eric,"I had a great stay while at a dance festival in Ballard.  While I didn't get to see much of my hosts, they were very accommodating and the room was very comfortable.  Thanks so much!"
2487892,22254973,2014-11-02,22408681,Amber,"Martin and Lauren were great hosts and made us feel welcome, both in town and in their home, including having use of the kitchen.  The queen size bed is a futon, and we found it comfortable.  The room feels private and is located only one block from Market Street in Ballard, making walking to shopping, dining and music a breeze.  A first great experience with an Air BNB listing. "
2487892,22961161,2014-11-18,23242594,Ellen,"Martin was welcoming in spite of a flight delay. The room was exactly as described. The house is in a quiet location and spotless. The location is perfect for finding interesting shops, and nice walks along the water. Martin was always available to answer questions. I would certainly stay there again."
2487892,23108674,2014-11-23,22930591,Jesse,"Martin and Lauren were both very friendly and accommodating. The room and bathroom were very clean. The suite itself is spread in a way that makes the space feel private and we never felt like we were intruding on their space - or them in ours. The neighbourhood is quite lovely, and close to everything. The only tricky part was finding it at first as Google maps tells you to turn onto a road that looks more like an alley or a driveway... but other than that, very easy to get to. "
2487892,23299669,2014-11-28,23255952,Joan,Our hosts were wonderful and the experience was wonderful

2487892,24978330,2015-01-04,5069033,Colin,Martin and Lauren were great hosts! Their rental space is very private and was a perfect location in Ballard to enjoy the neighborhood fully. My girlfriend and I felt very comfortable and appreciated the patio and ability to come and go as we pleased. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!

2487892,26004730,2015-02-01,25511594,Emily,"The room was exactly as described and exactly what I needed.  Really just two blocks from all of the retail and restaurants of downtown Ballard.  I didn't spend much time there as I was in an all day intensive training with very long hours, but it was a clean, comfortable, affordable and close alternative to an expensive hotel.  The hosts were very nice, easy to correspond with before my stay, and let me drop off my things a bit early.  If you need to stay right in Ballard, this is the place.    "
2487892,26239924,2015-02-08,14595788,Mike,Perfect location and setup. Thanks
2487892,26572425,2015-02-15,27507424,Kevin,Everything with our stay was great!  A nice room with a clean bathroom in a central location. Martin was very friendly and accommodating.
2487892,26988217,2015-02-23,25973314,Megan,"It was great staying with Martin and Lauren. Nothing can beat the location; if you're from out of town, the bars and restaurants in Downtown Ballard are fantastic and it's so convenient to be able to walk there. The room was small but still had enough space, and you had access to your own bathroom. The room you stay in is on the ground floor, and the rest of  the family is on the two above floors, so it feels very private! They have cats if you're allergic, and also a 2 year old who was a little noisy at times but never woke us up. 
Overall a great experience! Would definitely want to stay there again. "
2487892,28214879,2015-03-20,27310081,Steve,Martin and Lauren are super nice. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Their house is in a great neighborhood with a ton of stuff to do.
2487892,28729236,2015-03-29,28697665,Pablo,"Lauren & Martin are great hosts! The room has a super comfy bed, a really nice view and two adorable cats. We stayed for a couple of the days and had no problems getting in or out of the house as we pleased.  I would definitely stay at this location again. "
2487892,29055972,2015-04-03,7448809,Kirk,I had a nice stay while I was in town for work. I enjoyed being just a block from the main Ballard strip and I found the room and bathroom comfortable and convenient. Martin was helpful when I arrived and answered all my questions. I'd be happy to stay there again.
2487892,30243491,2015-04-19,26068381,Amanda,"Lovely place to stay- close to tons of fun stuff in the Ballard neighborhood! The Locks, the farmers market on Sunday and restaurants and bars galore. Bed and bath were private and it was a cozy little place to get some rest between my Seattle adventures. Was greeted by an adorable cat when I got there. Thanks Lauren and Martin!"
2487892,32363221,2015-05-17,31242422,Justin,"We had a lovely stay with Martin & Lauren. Their house is very well located in Old Ballard and the room is very comfortable and private. We didn't spend any time in the house besides in our room because we were out exploring for our one day in Seattle, but it's definitely recommended if you need a comfortable, affordable place to sleep."
2487892,32840781,2015-05-22,32345168,Nicholas,Great communication and a great location. Was exactly what I needed and the host was very polite. Overall it was a good stay and worry free. 
2487892,33070861,2015-05-25,1331298,Crystal And Chris,"Our stay here was very convenient and comfortable. Walking distance from the various shops and restaurants in Ballard. The room was simple, no frills... just what we needed. Being on the first floor of the complex made it seem private and unobtrusive. Having the private bathroom was key with me being 6 months pregnant! I would recommend their place to those who don't sleep in late, their toddler was a little noisy in the morning but that didn't bother us.. We're both early risers.  We didn't have any problems with noise late at night. Also, check in and check out was really easy... Didn't have the opportunity to meet Martin in person but did briefly meet Lauren who was super welcoming! Thank you!"
2487892,33796218,2015-06-01,2487915,Bela,"It was a nice location and a place, nearby stores and restaurants. "
2487892,34139477,2015-06-05,8090534,Steffi,Martin and his wife were very nice hosts. We enjoyed the time at their place. We had an own entrance so that it was private. Martin and Lauren were very nice and  helpful. Thank you for letting us staying at your place. 
2487892,34362169,2015-06-07,34540444,Chris,Great location and good communication!  Thanks Lauren and Martin!
2487892,34679466,2015-06-10,7792284,Amit,"Martin and Lauren were super nice! They did their best to help us out with everything and were extremely welcoming to their home.
The room itself was comfortable, though a bit small (we traveled with a baby) , and unfortunatly not very clean. the porch is a big plus. The location is wonderful!"
2487892,35238165,2015-06-16,33872483,Irene,My friend and I had a fantastic stay here! Our hosts were both super helpful with tips and suggestions as well as very respectful of our privacy. We especially appreciated how accommodating they were for our schedule in terms of check in and check out times. The bed was plenty comfortable for two people and the room and bathroom were both neat and clean. We loved that the listing was only a few minutes' walk away from downtown Ballard and easily accessible to a number of bus routes. We loved the neighborhood and would definitely stay here again if we were to return for a second visit!
2487892,35565955,2015-06-20,8279498,Jean-François,I loved the neighbourhood : Ballard is packed with nice pubs and restaurants. Martin's house was located close to a bus stop that took us downtown in about 30 minutes. It was great to have our own private bathroom.
2487892,36148840,2015-06-25,25573003,Sabrina,"It was a great stay at Martins house, he and his family are very helpful, nice and communicative. We enjoyed our stay with them very much, as the location is great and by bus you are within 25 min downtown Seattle ;-) highly recommended place to stay at. ;-))"
2487892,36399447,2015-06-28,11342358,Sarina,Really great location in Ballard. Close to public transportation downtown (15 min bus). Super nice hosts and very clean! Would stay again. 
2487892,40908394,2015-08-03,32533607,Karen,"Such nice hosts, a perfect location, and very comfortable and clean. I highly recommend. "

2487892,42287198,2015-08-12,37366734,Phil,"Martin and Lauren were great! Their place was nice. I loved the back porch being connected to the room. It was perfect for writing and reading. Their place was right near the botanical gardens and Chittenden Locks in Ballard. If you stay here, get an Orca card - the buses and trains will be your friends. I definitely would stay here again."
2487892,42888212,2015-08-16,38034762,Kate,"Ballard is a cool neighborhood! Our hosts were great, the room was comfy, everything was good :) "
2487892,43509984,2015-08-20,6635733,Chris,"Had a great time in Ballard! Great location to check out this amazing neighborhood, easy to hop a bus downtown, too, about 30-40 minutes.

Room was nice and clean, a little small but plenty for two people to comfortably stay several days. Had a nice outdoor area, and is on a separate floor from the rest of the home so plenty of privacy.

Thanks! Gracious and friendly hosts."
2487892,44151405,2015-08-24,21047052,Julia,"Great place to stay for a few days while in Seattle! Ballard is a little outside the downtown hub, but there is a direct bus line 2 blocks from the house. Very nice hosts, helpful and there to answer any questions! "
2487892,45108291,2015-08-31,10749588,Fabio,"Lauren has been very friendly, the room was clean and good for 2 people. They told us they were out of town when we were arriving but the cats gave us the welcome. They live in a nice neighborhood with good connection to the city center (30-40 mins by bus)"
2487892,46615666,2015-09-12,884973,Janette,"This room suited my needs in Seattle and I was made to feel welcome by Martin and Lauren. Their toddler was shy but adorable and there was no problem with any noise. The room is basic, small, has a futon, an adjacent bathroom and a walkout to a patio which helps it feel more spacious. It's straight through from the entrance door and is the only living space at ground level so very private. I liked that it had lots of shelving and room for storage in the closet. I was welcome to use their kitchen for fridge storage and microwaving my breakfast oatmeal. Not quite like the photos since it's in full use as a family space.  The photos represented my room well (as long as you are aware of what wide angle lenses do) but I found the bathroom shower in need of a good grout scrub in areas  if it was to look all shiny and white as shown in the photos. The location was good too, being in an interesting neighbourhood called Ballard. There was a supermarket and bus stop for the downtown bus two blocks away. The took 35 minutes to deposit you near Pikes market and all the sights of downtown Seattle. And as a visiting senior the ride only cost a dollar! On balance this was a great place for my visit to Seattle. "
2487892,47625702,2015-09-21,13896806,Greg,"The hosts were friendly and helpful, and their room met my needs. It's a pretty simple bedroom+bathroom setup with a good deal of privacy, and worked great as my place to crash between all the activities of a wedding weekend. "
2487892,49357469,2015-10-03,43708389,Isaac,"Great location, right next to public transportation, awesome location in Ballard."
2487892,49928365,2015-10-07,44105348,Mat,"This place is ideal for experiencing the best of Seattle, beautiful area.  You couldn't ask for a better location.  I have no regrets from this stay, clean, quiet, comfy and everything you need is walking distance.  Martin & Lauren are nice people and I am grateful they shared their home with my cousin and I."
2487892,50278548,2015-10-11,4981079,Lauren,Martin & Lauren are great! They are incredibly gracious and flexible hosts. The place is just as described and the neighborhood is amazing. It's a great place to stay if you're looking to explore Seattle. They are right in the middle of the action! We had a very late flight and Lauren and Martin were life savers and let us keep our bags there later than check out. 
2487892,50800929,2015-10-14,45773823,Adam,"Great hosts; nice, charming neighborhood; private room & bathroom. Would definitely return and recommend. "

2487892,51897245,2015-10-25,29825181,Maureen,"I was very happy with my experience staying with Martin and Lauren who were very friendly and welcoming. This was an absolutely perfect location for me!! It was near my dance venue and in a charming neighborhood with fantastic restaurant, coffee, grocery shopping and other shopping opportunities. Easy arrangements coming and going from the lower level of their house, with lots of privacy because I was on my own level. The bedroom was smallish (just like the pictures), but I was there alone and it was perfectly adequate; ditto the bathroom. I thought the bed was very cozy and comfy.  I will absolutely try to come back again the next time I do a dance weekend in Ballard."
2487892,53996976,2015-11-15,46800373,Ryan,"Great experience with very nice hosts. I would 100% recommend it. They layout is perfect for guests and having a private bathroom was great! 

"
2487892,54992922,2015-11-27,34154361,Danny,"My partner and had a great time. We were only there for a short bit, but they were nothing but attentive and welcoming. It's a cute room with a spotless bathroom. We'd definitely stay there again. "
2487892,56694444,2015-12-16,17243884,Dario,I have the opportunity to stay with Martin and Lauren. I had an excellent experience. The place was as described. I had total privacy; the room is a few steps from the main entrance with a bathroom next to it. I was given a code for the entrance door and we had some friendly interaction at times. The place was clean and near all buss lines and Ballard´s downtown. The bed was comfortable and warm. I would definitively stay with them again when I go back to Ballard.
2487892,56950457,2015-12-20,2866541,Jennifer,"Martin and Lauren's accommodation was very good - the location is great, they communicated very well with us and it was easy to find the room and the guest bathroom.  I liked that they were downstairs so we did not feel too intrusive.  We didn't spend any time with the hosts, but from our brief encounter they were friendly and I can recommend this listing as a convenient and straight-forward place to stay in Ballard."
4760181,24392336,2014-12-27,887019,John,"We had a great stay at Felix's place. It was basically everything that you would want: clean, orderly, comfortable. Felix was leaving town the day we were arriving, but he was very accommodating and even dropped off a key for us at my sister's place. Felix was prompt about communicating things he thought we should know and replying to any questions we had."
4760181,25057895,2015-01-05,24269420,Eddie,"What a great experience for a first time airbnber. I felt as if I was heading home to my own place at the end of each day. The location was very convenient and Felix kept everything very clean and organized. I was also just minutes away from the wonderful 24/7 Ballard Market if I ever did need anything. 

As a host, Felix was a very helpful and accommodating. A very laid back guy that truly enjoys meeting and offering recommendations to his guests (it was like crashing at an old buddy's place). On top of that, he has two adorable and well trained boxers that he brings out when he's home! 

All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thanks Felix!"
4760181,25121804,2015-01-06,25617967,Tiffany,"Felix was a fantastic host that was super friendly and welcoming. He definitely makes you feel at home and I really like how detailed the descriptions were prior to our arrival. We had to do a lot of communicating due to some delays, and he was very responsive throughout our entire stay. Overall he was really easy to talk to and it was nice that we were able to grab a quick lunch with him on the first day, during which he gave some great advice on what to do in the Seattle area. 

The room itself was nice and I liked the fact that the heater kept us so toasty in the freezing weather. There were more than enough blankets for the two of us, with an extra one sitting in the closet. Though we didn't use it much, the tv in the room was nice to have as well. The location was extremely convenient and we were able to get everywhere we wanted to go to in a short amount of time. 

Great place to stay if you're in the Seattle area! Oh and Felix's two dogs are the most adorable and lovable furry little animals ever :) 
"
4760181,25256705,2015-01-10,24711474,Simon,"A friend and I stayed at Felix place while stopping in Seattle during our roadtrip. He was an amazing host and made us feel like at home. The seperate room with it's own bathroom is very convenient and we could also use the kitchen and living room. The whole apartment was very clean and a good starting point to explore Seattle because the neighbourhood is really nice and the public transportation is close which makes it easy to get everywhere. Even though we stayed at his place during weekdays, Felix took the time to show us some nice places and gave us many recommendations where to go.

We had an awesome stay with the perfect host and can recommend him to everybody!"
4760181,26002936,2015-02-01,19715661,George,"I stayed for 21 days! The description is accurate.

The place is new, neat and clean and Felix puts in lot of effort to keep it that way. He is also tech savvy so the house is furnished with all gadgets you can think of.

The house is well connected to the city you can find restaurants and supermarkets close by.

Felix respects privacy and accommodates any level of interaction. He is also always reachable by text if he is not home. And if you are into dogs you are in for a treat cause you will find 2 or 3 :)"
4760181,26222347,2015-02-07,26552106,Jayson,"I went to Seattle for business trip. 

I was planning to stay at Hotel. But I needed cozy place like home to relax and it was great choice that I stayed in Felix's house instead of hotel.

I got to say just one thing. ""Best!""
nice and clean house with great host!

I'm going to stay his house next year!
"

I highly recommend staying with Felix!"
