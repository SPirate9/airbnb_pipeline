1520501,18646062,2014-08-30,6342305,Julian,Totally awesome place! I met great people and had lots fun chilling in that house and in that area of Seattle.
1520501,20294208,2014-09-27,20615996,Alexandra,"Matt (house lead in lieu of Andrew) is awesome! Super chill dude, very sociable and accommodating. The neighbourhood is great, the house is practically on Broadway, so that's nice. I'd definitely stay here again for a short term visit."
1520501,30466062,2015-04-22,448728,Karen,"The house matches its description: the house captain was friendly and communicative. The facilities are very basic. The nearby street is very enjoyable, with coffee shops, groceries and printing facilities nearby. AirBnBers, though all coming and going on their own schedules, are generally open to connecting around ideas, which is a nice vibe. Covered bike storage is reasonably accessible. Folks were quiet and desk space was appreciated and great for getting some work down.

All that aside, who's likely not to like this place? Those who dislike or have no experience with old, run-down houses showing their age, or negotiating shared living — this reminded me more of a hostel than anything else. Those who aren't interested in REALLY roughing it as part of a tradeoff on cost and location. House policies are conveyed largely through the captain and posted ad-hoc so there's a bit of ambiguity and lack of guidance on manners, etiquette on sharing space. The neighbourhood can be a bit rough around the edges sometimes in the evenings."
1520501,35971162,2015-06-23,34791408,Steven,"The situation was more or less like a hostel, only a tier more expensive, and a bit more interpersonal.  I thought the company was okay at the time I was there, but I imagine it's a crapshoot what kind of people are going to be there at any given time.  Maybe it speaks to the narrowness of my own interests, but I didn't have a lot to talk about with most of the people I encountered about their projects.  But you can be reasonably sure you won't be sharing space with obnoxious party-types of the kind endemic to typical hostels; pretty much everyone there was a professional of some type and understood the value of a good night's sleep.

Wasn't thrilled with the fact that I didn't get responses to questions I sent the day before through AirBnB until I got there and started calling people around check-in time.  Also, the shower/tub was blocked up during the time I was staying there, although I get the impression the management is probably going to do something about that, since it was brought up by them about halfway through my 8 day stay.  However, it wasn't fixed in the remaining 4 days, so who knows.

You could do worse than staying here, but I don't know that it lived up to the hype of being a ""hackerspace"".  Location's great, at any rate, which is probably the biggest reason to recommend it.

Nicholas's guide of good nearby places was immensely helpful for me since I was unfamiliar with the area. The binder with necessary info was empty so I messaged Nicholas asking about the wifi password et al, and he got back to me right away with the info. My hunch from interacting with him is that he's probably already fixed this for the next guest, so it shouldn't be a problem again, but if you run into any questions or problems definitely check in with him, as he's very responsive."
6761267,35185581,2015-06-15,35522314,Angie,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was delightful! The carriage house was recently remodeled, very clean and lots of windows. The courtyard garden is a really nice bonus. Nick was very responsive to my questions and concerns, without being intrusive. He even had a blow dryer delivered when I asked about one! He also gave me some suggestions and pointers about sightseeing. It was a great stay in a great town."
6761267,35520067,2015-06-19,3901175,David,"This is apartment is really lovely and private -- it was very cozy and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed. Nick has excellent taste, and has renovated it to a very high standard.  Our first night there were a few sirens (it's close to a hospital), but not loud, and otherwise it's a remarkably quiet neighborhood being so close to downtown.  Great restaurants and a food coop a short walk away, and less than half an hour walk to the ferry."
6761267,36157293,2015-06-25,36450919,Miranda,"This apartment was clean, taken care of, and was a great place to stay on my quick visit to Seattle.  Nick was very accommodating and I am glad I chose to stay in this rental."
6761267,37207973,2015-07-05,35833379,Joseph,"Our stay was excellent. The house was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen had everything to cook a couple meals and there was plenty of space to spread out and relax. The neighborhood is very walkable and felt very safe.

The only disappointing part of our stay was how hot it was. Nick has a nice new air conditioner in the living room but during our stay it was unseasonably warm (low 90's) and it just couldn't keep up in the afternoon and evening. Probably won't be an issue for 99% of guests.

We would definitely stay again!"
6761267,37401216,2015-07-06,2929116,Vanessa,"The space is indeed newly refurbished and comfortably furnished, but it's quite cozy. the bed is one of the better airbnbs I've experienced. Our hosts were very kind and accommodating. "
6761267,37815484,2015-07-10,37697690,Cheryl,This over-garage in law unit was charmingly appointed and clean. I didn't use the kitchen but all the essentials were there and everything was new. The neighborhood was very walkable and it was easy to get an Uber without a wait to get downtown for my work. A great place for a couple. 
6761267,38089700,2015-07-12,9951926,Tim,The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6761267,38297584,2015-07-14,35664163,Gary,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Carriage House.  The Carriage House is a one bedroom, one bathroom, Kitchen and living area located above the owner's Garage.  There is easy access from the street without imposing on the owner.

The unit was recently redone and is clean and neat.  The Kitchen is fully furnished and provided everything we needed.  The owner provides a small space for parking, but we found parking on the street easier and just as convenient.  

We will definitely consider staying here again."
6761267,39033929,2015-07-20,35659078,Mikael,"The Cherry Hill Carriage House is located in a quiet neighborhood and, if one is willing to (which we did), is a 30-45 minute walk to Pike Public Market and the piers.  The house had everything we needed to feel right at home after a day of exploring Seattle. The kitchen had everything to cook a meal and the bed was very comfortable.  Living room has a soft couch to relax on while watching TV.  Our stay happened to be during some gorgeously sunny weather, so the bedroom got a bit warm during the late afternoons.  Fortunately, the window AC unit works like a charm and cools the house efficiently.  Nick provided a info book for guests and it had some great neighborhood recommendations.  There was one evening that we had spotty WiFi, but after contacting Nick, it was fixed in no time.  This was an awesome experience, especially being our first time to Seattle and our first AirBnB visit.  Nick is a great host and this house is worth a stay all on its own."
6761267,39256902,2015-07-21,1961441,Lily,"Nick has a lovely apartment, clean and private,nicely furnished, complete with welcome chocolates, water and soft drinks. His instructions were very clear, got in no problem, and had everything we needed. Only 2 concerns: the neighborhood is OK but not wonderful and there was a lot of air traffic when we were there. Luckily planes stop flying sometime after 10pm, so we slept really well. "
6761267,39948404,2015-07-27,35143498,Graham,"A very nice place that has all the furnishings needed for your stay in Seattle, and more than enough room for two.  Nice relaxing couch and very comfortable bed, and the fully equipped kitchen was perfect if we needed to cook any meals.  The air conditioning was a relief after a warm day and from walking from downtown to the home.  It is a nice walk ~25 minutes, or more if you prefer to take your time.  Would be a quick cab ride if you prefer that too.  Nick's information on the site, as well as the host guide in the unit was helpful as we were unfamiliar with the area.  Great communication with quick responses and helpful information.  Would stay again."
6761267,40287265,2015-07-29,28834116,David,Nick's communication was amazing before and after the stay. He made an accommodation for us that went above and beyond what is required of an AirBnB host. Looking forward to staying again!
6761267,41113127,2015-08-04,37612570,Livia,"I enjoyed my stay and the little details such as:  complimentary gift, portable air conditioner and fan as the temperature increased during my stay and black-out curtains in bedroom (as I'm a light sleeper). I enjoyed having a full kitchen which I used.  Pictures of cottage was accurate.  Proximity was great for visiting my child; variety of restaurants & grocery store.  Also, great walking paths. "
6761267,41766518,2015-08-09,15449595,Carly,"We very much enjoyed staying at Nick's Carriage House! It was very clean and the perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway. Nick was also very responsive and provided a small notebook with restaurant and other recommendations. It was close to many things, but always easy to get an Uber or taxi as well. We would definitely stay again next time we visit Seattle!"
6761267,42061379,2015-08-10,34323029,Matthew,"Nick was very accommodating and friendly when we were booking the carriage house. He was available via email for any questions we had prior to our stay.  Quaint little apartment, perfect for our little outing to Seattle"
6761267,42427265,2015-08-13,7805852,Karen,"This was a sweet little place to stay, well-equipped and comfortable. Nick was very responsive before, during, and after our stay. I did need to remind him that we had agreed on an early check-in following our 11-hour flight, but he got right on it and everything was ready. One note for those with heavy bags or mobility issues: the entrance is up a long-ish flight of stairs. Great place, though, and as we live in the neighborhood, we will recommend it to our out-of-town visitors!"
6761267,42723849,2015-08-15,17638975,Reggie,"Nick was very accommodating from the start. He made sure that we were able to get this apartment for our stay (even with some sort of glitch with Airbnb). Communication was great- he was very informative and helpful. There even is a binder that lists a lot of helpful information such as sites to see, restaurants, and grocery stores.

The apartment was great. The pictures on the site accurately depicted the space. It was also nice that it had an a/c unit- it helped cool the place during the untimely warm weather we had during our stay. It was also walking distance to Capitol Hill and even the downtown area (about a 30 minute walk). The neighborhood was just ok though, but we mostly spent our time in Capitol Hill and downtown anyway. The only downside we had with this place was that the Wi-Fi wasn't working and that we thought there was laundry in the apartment (we didn't know it was in the main house and that it was coin operated). We would definitely stay here again in the future."
6761267,43207636,2015-08-17,41631274,Brandon,Nick was an amazingly attentive and responsive host. The carriage house was exactly as described and a perfect cozy little place to recharge after exploring. I will definitely recommend staying here any time you're in Seattle.
6761267,43330827,2015-08-18,10891336,Amanda,"The carriage house is absolutely wonderful. The space is very comfortable and clean, and equipped with all the amenities needed to enjoy your stay. The location is great, too. It's close enough to the touristy Pike Place Market, and within walking distance to some great Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. Nick is a very accommodating host, and provided helpful information about things to see and places to visit. I highly recommend this listing! "
6761267,43442520,2015-08-19,41176339,Irene,"The Carriage House was clean, neat and nicely furnished. The bed was comfortable and the linens smelled fresh. The shower had great coverage and pressure and the liquid soap provided was appreciated so there are no partially used bars one doesn't know what to do with but doesn't want to throw away. The welcoming goodies were very nice and having the option to light a fire outside was fun. We didn't take advantage of the firepit since it was so hot outside. We also felt it was a little odd having the neighbors using the outside patio and looking in at us as we read on the couch. The owners gave us the privacy they repeatedly promised, but it would be nice to either not expect that same thing from others on the land, or to share that expectation with the others and get their buy-in. We also were not warned about the sirens that are a part of life when 2 blocks from Swedish Children's Hospital, so we were unprepared and didn't bring earplugs to help us sleep. We found the kitchen very minimal and were glad we had brought our food already cooked and only needing to be heated. In particular, we missed a toaster in the morning. I am recovering from two hip operations and although I realized that I didn't convey this to the owners, I reread their materials and nowhere were the number and steepness of the steps described. It was difficult for me to get to the unit and once there, a barrier to me leaving. We found the views from our windows depressing, with lots of power lines, unkempt neighbor houses, and the demolition underway on the main house that we weren't told to expect. We were told that the wireless was unavailable before arriving but after paying, so that was a disappointment. We would have liked a cable for our laptops or smartphones to hook to the big screen so we could have at least watched movies we brought with us. The shoddy workmanship on the Carriage House remodel (strike plates bent, electrical access holes too big for their cover plates, non-code entrance steep step, lack of secure attachment to the incomplete molding around the bathroom door, inward-opening doors to sloped storage roof that blocked the doors from fully opening, lack of emergency exit or clear fire extinguisher locations, etc.) did not impress us with confidence that things were done safely behind what was visible (plumbing, venting, insulation, wiring.) In short, we would not stay here again, although we think its funkiness might appeal to others more."
6761267,43982111,2015-08-23,32613273,Praveen,Nick was an amazing host for us. The place was exactly as described and he made sure to make us feel welcome from beginning to end. Definitely easy to get a hold of for any sort of question. 
6761267,44240568,2015-08-24,19395948,Carrie,Lovely and clean apartment in a nice neighborhood. Nick was very helpful via email and we had a great stay. 
6761267,44398394,2015-08-25,15351041,Ivy,"Nick's place was beautiful and newly renovated. It should noted this unit faces the side street rather than the addressed street. All the amenities one can find at a hotel room were provided much to my surprise. Nick was a pleasure to deal with. I will note that this is an urban neighborhood and those that want a sterile suburban home will not find it here. I, coming from LA's koreatown love the slight grit yet totally safe neighborhood live it to bits. It's again totally safe to park and seems to be mid gentrification."
6761267,44500456,2015-08-26,2203746,Monika,Nick was especially kind to me and my friend when we stayed in Seattle for two nights.  His place is impeccably clean and the fridge was stocked with essentials when we arrived.  The bed was totally comfortable and the wifi was fast enough for the two of us to have concurrent Skype meetings.  It was a great stay.
6761267,44704495,2015-08-28,7150999,Ian,"We had an amazing time staying at Nick's place! Such a great location for seeing things around Capitol Hill and even such a short cab ride to pike place and downtown. Great, modern looking apartment with plenty of room and everything you need. We would highly recommend staying here!"
6761267,45077949,2015-08-31,35505191,Spencer,"The space was wonderful and perfect for us. It was within a good walking distance of so much that it made for an excellent vacation. 

The kitchen was well funished, the bed very comfortable, overall a very clean and tidy space. The parking was odd but worked well for our mini cooper. "
6761267,45437035,2015-09-02,21418125,Jewls,"The cottage was amazing, super cozy and exactly what I needed for a 2 night business trip stay in Seattle.  Nick had a great booklet that he created with the best things to do and see in Seattle.  I would definitely stay here again!"
6761267,46156937,2015-09-08,22897667,Amy,"This property was perfect for my boyfriend and I who were visiting Seattle for the first time. We don't like staying in the hustle and bustle but rather be in the area where locals are and Nick's property offered that! It was a short walk to really great eateries and hip neighborhoods with great company, food and drinks! This property is also great if you plan to rent a car. It was super easy and convenient for us to park. 

The carriage house will surprise you with how much room it has! It felt just like home. I will definitely be visiting Nick the next time I am in town."
6761267,46422598,2015-09-10,30930545,Jeremiah,"Nick's place was great. It was very close to downtown and Capitol Hill, which made for a fun and convenient experience. Everything in the carriage house was very clean and of good quality. There were some treats in the fridge, which was also a nice touch. I would definitely stay here again if I had the chance."
6761267,46537083,2015-09-11,37328626,Kelsey,"The home was everything we hoped and more! Very clean, free parking (big enough for my big ol' tahoe), inviting decor, perfect location. There were a couple drinks and a welcome snack in the fridge for us, which was so sweet! I only wish we had time to stay longer and utilize the outdoor space! I will definitely stay here again when in the area, thanks Nick!!"
6761267,46745893,2015-09-13,40709240,Camille,"Though from the outside it doesn't look like much, this one bedroom apartment (separate from the main house) is modern, clean, and just what we were looking for. "
6761267,47796103,2015-09-21,18596062,Jeremy,"Great location. The more we got to know the neighborhood, the more we realized how great of an area it was. The apartment is stand-alone above the garage, which meant no sharing walls and created a nice private retreat in the middle of the city. Lots of great restaurants with walking distance or a short drive. "
6761267,48054233,2015-09-22,3972608,Anna,"The Carriage House was perfect for our short overnight stay in Seattle. It was beautiful, clean and the heater worked very well. The internet was fast and easy to connect to and the parking in front was very convenient. Nick was pleasant and prompt with his responses and respected our privacy. I highly recommend this rental. "
6761267,48258364,2015-09-24,4392285,Richard,"Excellent! It was exactly as advertised. it was clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed.  Thanks!!"
6761267,48754205,2015-09-28,5284399,Tom,I booked Nick's place for a friend visiting the area. The report back was completely positive. Thanks for a great stay and communication. 
6761267,48955202,2015-09-29,44797809,甜心,small but sweet house.Welcoming drink and detailed tips about the house and surroundings makes this trip nice.And they do have great neighbours.
6761267,49273100,2015-10-02,8647582,James,"Great place, perfect location"
6761267,50207659,2015-10-10,15600689,Lauren,Nick and the carriage house were both wonderful! Easy to communicate with and quick to reply - he also provided loads of recommendations in the area. The location is awesome - we were easily able to park our rental car and then walked everywhere as everything you need is nearby. The carriage house is lovely - lots of room and a great little kitchen and separate living area. Felt very at home for our one night in Seattle! 
6761267,50398928,2015-10-11,1572814,Jonathan,"Nick was an excellent and communicative host. The location and overall experience were perfect for my brief stay, and I expect that I will look to return for future visits to the area. The rooms were clean and nicely furnished."
6761267,50818259,2015-10-14,13241634,Mike,"Nick's carriage house was wonderful, and it would be a pleasure to stay there the next time I'm in Seattle.  It was clean, bright, inviting, and in a terrific location near downtown and a pleasant walk from shops and restaurants in Capitol Hill. It was a fantastic place to spend a little while relaxing.  Nick was prompt, responsive, and made things very easy for me and my girlfriend when our trip hit an unexpected snag. I'd strongly and enthusiastically recommend staying here."
6761267,50997431,2015-10-16,45908880,Theodore,This was my first time using airbnb and Nick made it a great experience.  He was very promp responding to texts and provided clear directions to find the house and where to park.  The house is nice and comfortable on a quiet street.  There are lots of places with in walking distance and getting an uber never took over 5 mins.  I would defenitely book again.
6761267,51364446,2015-10-19,23088409,Maryvonne,"Very clean, comfortable, and private apartment with convenient parking.
Nice neighborhood for walking with great (vietnamese) restaurant (Ba Bar) and coffee shops"
6761267,51815521,2015-10-24,4907461,Kurt,"The house was immaculate and extremely cute, just as pictured.  Seamless stay.  Thanks again!"
6761267,52794548,2015-11-01,9517608,Alex,"Nick's carriage house is exactly what we were looking for. It was a simple, clean, well stocked place to stay in a central location.
He provided all of the necessary amenities of a hotel plus a few extras.  Would certainly stay here again as Nick was responsive and helpful."
6761267,53084075,2015-11-04,4344860,Mustafa,"Nick's space was perfect! Once the heater got running, it was super cozy. It had everything we needed and was very convenient given that I had an interview at Swedish Cherry Hill right across the street. It was very clean and neat. The welcome chocolates and tea were a treat. Also the free parking and nice courtyard were a plus. Thank you for a wonderful time!!"
6761267,54009575,2015-11-15,27557079,Dan,"We arrived late, which wasn't a problem. Nick was able to easily accommodate. The carriage house is perfectly sized for 1 or 2 people. Everything we could need was available, including kitchen items and extra towels for the bathroom. Our only warning is if you come when it is cold: the floors get chilly so be sure to bring slippers! Otherwise it was a wonderful stay, and we were within walking distance of everything we wanted to see downtown and in Capitol Hill. "
6761267,54557277,2015-11-21,38984510,Henry,"Nice clean well-lit place. Not heated well enough for 32 degree night, though."
6761267,54664214,2015-11-22,4020121,Rob,"We loved Nick's carriage house. It was situated perfectly on top of hill just around the corner from Seattle University and capital hill's shopping and cafes. 

The house was the perfect size for our stay. The street was very quiet. And it was perfectly clean. "
6761267,55622216,2015-12-03,39844817,Aaron,"The Carriage House was very roomy, and spotless. The location was great, with a bus stop right across the street that connected to everything. Nick was a great host who really let us get settled in and comfortable with the space. The amenities were perfect, right down to sugar in the sugar bowl. We really enjoyed the full kitchen, and access to a washer and dryer. All in all, Nick was a great host, and we really enjoyed our time here."
6761267,55859545,2015-12-06,4296489,New,"Nick's apartment was great! Very easy to get to from the airport by public transportation, and also only a short drive from all the main attractions of downtown Seattle. The apartment has everything you need, and I couldn't have picked a better location."
6761267,56467910,2015-12-13,45295379,Lars,"Very nice place, great location, amazing deal. I'd definitely recommend this place and I'm sure I'll try to stay here if I come back to Seattle. "
4387985,22339289,2014-11-03,22900102,Dan,"Cool little house, exactly as described. Nice central location in a quiet neighborhood with ample parking (and only a $6 Lyft ride from downtown!)

David was super easy to communicate with and had no issues meeting me after I had to delay my arrival by 2 hours. 

Would definitely book this one again!"
4387985,22614908,2014-11-10,19865308,Graham,"David's place was the perfect base camp for a football weekend. He was nice enough to accomodate a late checkin, gave us the grand tour, and even left some killer cookies as a welcome present.

The house itself was awesome, and the decor really made you feel at home...just wish we had brought bathing suits to take advantage of the hot tub!"
4387985,23401294,2014-11-30,3264217,Nicole,"David and his wife, Michelle's, house was wonderful.  I rented their space for my inlaws who were in town for Thanksgiving.  My mother-in-law was a bit reluctant to stay in a strangers house but after staying in David's place, she's a complete convert to the winning ways of AirBnB.  She just loved it!  While small, the house is very comfortable and well located.  It was impeccably clean and tidy.   I would highly recommend staying and have, in fact, alerted my friends in the neighborhood for future rentals."
4387985,23965804,2014-12-15,12030437,Graeme,Very comfortable and well-equipped home. Everything went smoothly with keys etc. Wish we could have had longer to stay and enjoy the place.
4387985,24059934,2014-12-18,816187,Alan,"This worked to really well. The place is immaculate, has nice features (fireplace, small hot tub), good for a couple or small family. It's in a residential area but close to coffee/brewpub and a quick swing over to downtown Seattle. No hassles dealing with the hosts."
4387985,24646140,2015-01-01,22972451,Xinyi,We have a nice holiday in David's house. It's clean and beautiful inside. The two bedrooms are great. David provided many necessary stuffs like towels and tablewares. You can find what you need in the kitchen. David is a great host and gave us many recommendations of the neighbor restaurants. There are many buses near the house. So the traffic is very convenient. I like the location of house where is near to the downtown of Seattle. I hope I can live there again next time when I go to Seattle. 
4387985,25602770,2015-01-20,14320817,Emily,We had a great stay.  The house is adorable and was very clean and well taken care of.  Everything went smoothly from booking to communication and check in!  Highly recommend.
4387985,25859692,2015-01-27,3884099,Frank,"This was our 6th visit to Seattle and David's place is our new favorite! We like this part of the city and we just love the house. Very well decorated, it's personal and we felt at home from the second we opened the door.  Very well equipped kitchen. The veranda is nice and the hot tub is also a great feature. Next time we will first look if David's place is available!"
4387985,26064114,2015-02-02,4810065,Trey,"David's home was perfect for what I needed on my trip to Seattle! Great location, cozy, warm, plenty of on street parking. Highly recommended!"
4387985,26369841,2015-02-10,26705327,Steven,"Great place, great location, great host! Place was cozy, and within walking distance to cafes,  restaurants, and microbreweries. Our hosts provided treats, fresh towels and great advice on venturing through the neighbourhood. Great find.

"
4387985,26623525,2015-02-16,10980687,Andrew,"This house was exceptional! The house itself is adorable and has everything you could possibly need for a great trip. The neighborhood is charming and quiet, while still being super central and within walking distance of great bars and restaurants. Most importantly, David and Michelle had everything ready to go for us early, which definitely helped with the stress of having people arriving at different times of day. I'd definitely stay here again the next time I visit Seattle!"
4387985,27012196,2015-02-23,27246484,Gillian,"Myself and my 3 friends spent a lovely weekend in Seattle and really enjoyed our stay at David and Michelle's. Both hosts were very accommodating and helpful and also offered late check out on the last day of our stay which was fantastic.

The home itself was lovely and also very conveniently located ... Only a $6-7 uber ride to down town and all the major attractions of the city.

I would stay here again and thoroughly recommend this place to future visitors.

Thanks for letting us use your home!"
4387985,27361518,2015-03-02,2406253,Will,"Great spot in Seattle, loved the neighborhood, easy and fast communication - we'd definitely stay here again when we come back!"
4387985,28267760,2015-03-21,4958439,Sean,"My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in David's home. Cozy is the perfect description for the place. It had everything we needed and more.  Very comfortable.

The fluidity of our plans didn't allow for us to meet David, but he was communicative, made check-in hassle free and has put together a great resource book for guests. 
"
4387985,28799724,2015-03-30,24113438,Lychee,"David and Michelle's home is exactly as advertised--and better. My friends and I stayed for a weekend and were happy to discover a clean, accommodating home in a lovely residential neighbourhood that is a short walk away from some cool restaurants/bars, and one short bus ride away from downtown Seattle. David and Michelle provided a helpful booklet with instructions and directions.

The house is charming and well-furnished, the bedrooms are quaint and tidy. The sofa bed, in case anyone is wondering, is very comfy. The fridge and kitchen were well-stocked, with many amenities. We'd all stay here again! Thanks! (:"
4387985,29611163,2015-04-10,28179204,Bastian,"Dave and Michelle made us feel amazingly welcome with prepared snacks & homemade banana bread. It's a cute little house that has everything you need for a relaxing holiday. It's also quite conveniently located, with easy parking and good access to public transportation. We enjoyed our stay a lot - thanks so much guys!"
4387985,30393982,2015-04-21,9954702,Ellen,"David's home was fantastic - great location, incredibly comfortable and clean.  David was very friendly and helpful, and there were cookies to greet us alongside a thorough neighborhood guide.  We loved sitting out on the patio and exploring the adorable neighborhood.  One of the best airbnb's I've stayed at!!!!"
4387985,31460320,2015-05-05,14334807,Dominique,"The house was simply perfect. Very beautiful and clean inside and out. We felt like we were home! Everything was as described, and even better. We would certainly come back to this house!"
4387985,31895449,2015-05-11,15866781,Annmarie,"This is a fabulous little house in a convenient Seattle neighborhood.  The place was immaculate, cozy, and cheerful-- with folk art and cheerfully painted walls throughout.  The outdoor deck was a wonderful place to relax at the end of the day as well.  David was easy to communicate with and accommodated a late arrival time- no problem.  It was a perfect spot for our family!"
4387985,32373631,2015-05-17,31515761,Xuesi,David has a lovely home. The room was clean and super comfortable. Awesome place to stay.... so close to downtown.
4387985,32592508,2015-05-19,16822379,Lee,"Beautiful home in an awesome location. It was the perfect place for our group of four during our visit to Seattle -- a quiet location but still walking distance to a ton of great bars and restaurants. The two person hot tub was surprisingly roomy, it was great to sit and relax outside. I hope it's available next time we visit Seattle!"
4387985,32835525,2015-05-22,31832333,Cory,"Wow ! This place was a treat to stay in ! Very cute house, with lots of personal touches. Luckily the weather was warm & we utilized the outdoor seating areas every day. David was great at answering all of our questions. Easy check in & check out. Short walk to the bus which took us to Pikes Place. Great recommendations in his book of things to do. Chucks Hop Shop had a different food truck everyday, which was fun too. Great neighborhood location. We would definitely stay here again "
4387985,33570055,2015-05-30,9150781,Stu,My family and I had a wonder time staying at David's little cottage. It's wonderfully decorated and everything was very clean on arrival. It's a great location and close to downtown Seattle along with some great restaurants in waking distance. I would highly recommend staying here!
4387985,33774829,2015-06-01,9977103,Jamie,Very nice stay. The house is really really beautiful and clean. The instructions are helpful and considerate. Thank you for sharing such romantic place to us. We love the experience in David's home.
4387985,34087551,2015-06-04,31319938,Nicole,David's home was absolutely perfect! We were celebrating a birthday and just wanted a relaxing vacation and this home was amazing for that! The outdoor deck was set up with lounge chairs and great for us to enjoy some dinner and cocktails and we enjoyed being able to cook in the adorable kitchen! The beds were VERY comfortable and the pull out couch was also very comfortable if you have extra people. The hot tub was very small but it was enjoyable for a relaxing evening! Also David left a book of some amazing restaurants within walking distance which was very helpful and delicious! He was very quick with any questions and very accomidating! This was our first airbnb stay and we definitely use it again as well as stay at David's again! Such an amazing experience!
4387985,34549935,2015-06-09,29412972,Ayaka,"We had such a lovely stay at Davdi's house this past weekend for 4 nights. It was 6 friends gathered for our high school reunion- size of the house was perfect for us to catch up and feel so intimate. The sofa in the living room was surprisingly comfortable and enough for 2 adults to sleep in.
The descriptions and pictures shown on the site is accurate, we loved everything about the house:)"
4387985,36868685,2015-07-02,31600910,Maria,"This was our first stay in an Airbnb and it was exactly like the photos.
Normally the word ""cozy"" conjures up visions of a cramped or tiny space, but that is NOT the case here. Everything was the right size and we didn't feel we were bumping into things. With two teenagers, having places to get away from each other and shut a door is important and worked well here.
It was unusually hot in Seattle and even though our host was half a world away, he had someone leave another box fan for us. If you require air conditioning, stay here when it isn't hot.
The place was very clean and there was a great notebook with instructions on how to use things and suggestions for places to eat.
Our kids tried the hot tub the first day but it was too hot to use after that.
We did not have a car but the public bus was close and easy. Except for a small deli/market, we had to travel a bit to find a supermarket but it was quite manageable. 
I heartily recommend this house and this host. 
I would give the place five stars except for the heat since we closed the windows every time we left the house as instructed. 
We stayed 4 nights. We arrived late but David left instructions on where to find the lockbox with a key."
4387985,38093572,2015-07-13,3236570,Paul,"David & Michelle were top notch hosts for our stay in Seattle, although we never met communication, gaining entry etc was all very easy.

It was particularly hot when we visited so they arranged an extra box fan which was most appreciated.

The house itself is lovely in a nice quiet part of Seattle with shops and a great beer hall the other end of the block (Chucks) which has rotating nightly food trucks. Public transport was easy to access with several bus route within 5mins of the house. Typical ride time to downtown was about 10-15 mins, the bus drivers are ace, very helpful & friendly (much like most of the Pacific Northwest)

NB: Get an Orca card it makes travel across the public transport network painless(the Safeway a few blocks from the house sells them)

Thanks for a good experience"
4387985,39148988,2015-07-21,25949273,Melissa,"This place was so great!  It was perfect for the amount of people that we had stay there (6 people).  Everything was so organized and it was easy to feel at home.  The little hot tub was so nice to relax in.  The deck was perfect for having dinners outside and lounge about.  I would stay here again and recommend it for any friends or family.

David was even nice enough to accommodate an early check in since our flight came in so early in the morning.

The neighborhood was great, so many placed to walk to.  Chucks Hop Shop was hands down our favorite local place to eat (food trucks) and drink (so many beers on tap!)"
4387985,41192390,2015-08-05,29749221,Patricia,"We had a great experience staying at David's house. The location was perfect, close to downtown and I 5. We used the bus to get into town rather than deal with parking and the bus stop was just a couple of blocks away. There were 5 in our group and we had plenty of room. The place had many extras we weren't expecting: spices, condiments, laundry soap, shampoo etc. I really enjoyed buying fresh fish at Pike market and being able to cook it on the BBQ! It was also nice to relax in the hot tub in the evening after walking all day. We couldn't have asked for a nicer place!"
4387985,42204206,2015-08-11,40078658,Kyle,Overall fantastic experience. Stay here to explore the city.
4387985,43415654,2015-08-19,2207686,Jacqueline,"What a gem of a home on a peaceful, treelined street in Capitol Hill! The house was spotless and well prepared for guests with clear instructions for everything we would need to know. The home is very beautifully decorated and the front porch seating area was a welcome haven for us to gather on sunny afternoons. David was very communicative and great to work with. We would absolutely stay here again. A dream Airbnb location!!"
4387985,44678702,2015-08-28,35023629,Tamara,"David was a gracious, friendly and considerate host. He left the most delicious banana chocolate chip loaf, along with bread , Nutella! And peanut butter and jelly. The house surpassed all of our expectations - it is made and designed for comfort. "
4387985,45131061,2015-08-31,9121755,Juliette,"Thanks so much for an amazing Airbnb experience! This house is absolutely charming with many beautiful details and we could not have been happier. The front yard has a private deck for hanging out and visiting and a lovely hot tub for two. There are two comfortable full size beds and a couch that converts to a super comfortable place to sleep. Its minutes away from Capital Hill and Seattle University area, and 10 minutes from ferry terminal. We would readily rent again!"
4387985,46467167,2015-09-11,31729468,Jessica,"The house was exactly as described and was very welcoming! David and Michelle were very accomedating from the beginning so our early check it was no problem. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful but within walking distance of many places: bars, restaurants, parks...but the yard was so nice, we just spent a lot of time hanging out there. I would highly recommend this listing and definitely would love to come back again. "
4387985,48191954,2015-09-24,4214814,Jennifer,"Our host was great and so was his place! He sent us a note the day we got there and unfortunately I completely forgot to let him know everything was great. 

The house was clean and comfortable and it was much better than staying in a hotel. We enjoyed how close we were to all the bars and restaurants so location is great. Neighborhood was a quiet area and felt very safe. 

My parents slept well in their bedroom and my sister enjoyed the sofa couch. I have to admit, it was one of the most comfortable sofa couches I've laid on. Our room was great as well although, if you like softer beds, this bed is a little bit on the firmer side.

They provided us with all that we could've asked for and we really appreciated that. Would definitely stay here again!

"
4387985,48686915,2015-09-28,36481578,Ece,"This house is perfect to chill after a day of intense sightseeing. House is spacious, well taken care of, clean and simply gorgeous. I loved every moment of staying in there. We asked for an early check-in and late check-out (1 hr) and David was incredibly accommodating. I will be most likely booking this house again next time I'm in Seattle."
4387985,49781448,2015-10-06,9876476,Philipp,"Place was awesome, nice and cozy just as the name said. The beautiful and stylish furnished house is close to the bus stop in a nice neighborhood (bars, supermarket and cafes close by. David was really nice and very helpful. We enjoyed our stay very much and would always stay again with them if ever visiting Seattle again."
4387985,50635624,2015-10-13,27260110,Sandi,This home was exactly what we were looking for while we stayed in Seattle for a week for a conference that I was attending. David was very accommodating as we were able to drop off our bags early and he answered messages very quickly for any questions we had. The house was so charming and had everything we could possibly need as well as notes throughout the house making the experience very enjoyable. David and his wife also left some WONDERFUL bread that they made which was a great personal touch! The house itself was perfect. The pull out couch and hot tub was my personal favorite. We were able to save money by getting food and grilling/cooking several nights rather than eating out for every meal. The house is very close to bus stops so we were able to purchase an ORCA card and get everywhere we wanted to go fairly easily. Overall it was a great experience!
4387985,51616588,2015-10-22,39770885,Tammy,"This home exemplifies attention to detail! Our stay was great.  We spent our days out and about Seattle and looked forward to going ""home"" to this cozy, comfy house. It's everything you need and more. "
4387985,52103064,2015-10-26,141448,Marc,"We loved our stay at David's and felt right at home in his beautiful space. Check-in/out were effortless, and the house fit 2 couples no-problem. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted with the house being so well located. There were also some nice touches that really went the extra mile, including a computer that was logged into Spotify and Netflix, a hot tub, and a thorough list of recommendations in the area. Would definitely stay here again when I find myself back in Seattle!"
4387985,53468370,2015-11-09,12225799,Katherine,We had a great time at David's little orange house!  It was totally cozy and had everything we needed.  The location was perfect and David was a very attentive host.  We especially loved how clean and sweetly decorated it was.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat!
4387985,53755786,2015-11-12,45757634,Timothy,The house was lovely and exactly what we were expecting.  The breakfast treats were a nice bonus.  The location was also nice since we were able to walk or bus to where we wanted to go.
4387985,54141975,2015-11-16,19932336,Catherine,"This little house is somehow even better than it looks online.  It is the most perfectly adorable little home in such a wonderful location.  We feel we couldn't have made a better decision when we picked this one out of a list of properties on Air BnB.  The host's attention to little details, such as having coffee and bagels for us, just made our stay that much more enjoyable.  We certainly hope we can stay here again when we're back visiting Seattle.  Thank you so much for opening your home to us!"
4387985,54713358,2015-11-23,22626106,Jody,"Really cute house!  The house was easy to access and we had no issues with our stay.  The place was clean, nicely decorated, and the neighborhood was quiet.  Plenty of on-street parking and within walking distance to the Capitol Hill area.  Would definitely stay here again."
4387985,55835459,2015-12-06,49494890,Jenny,"We really enjoyed staying in this adorable, little orange house.  The house was clean, well-kept, linens were super cozy, and the mattresses were SO comfortable.  Mattress heating pad is also a great feature!  The location is close to downtown and within walking distance to some great restaurants.  We were traveling with children and I do have to say that the dining/shopping area nearby is very young and trendy and not as kid-friendly.  But we had a car (free parking here is a huge plus!) and the location worked great for our stay.  David was very helpful and kind and the English muffins, Nutella, and milk were a nice touch--made my daughter feel right at home!  We will look forward to our next visit to Seattle!"
4387985,57647844,2015-12-28,35522192,Ann,"We loved staying at David's spotless orange house in the Central neighborhood. There was plenty of room for our family of four. We appreciated all the thoughtful touches -- muffins and bagels for breakfast, towels for the hot tub, twinkle lights in the yard. David did a great job of communicating with us, including directing us to the house. The location is excellent for exploring all parts of Seattle, especially Capitol Hill and Lake Washington."
6576228,35136377,2015-06-15,16145339,Citra,The apartment is very comfortable. All rooms were also furnished beautifully.
6576228,37341758,2015-07-06,34578324,Roxanne,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely apartment in Queen Anne!  Hannah was a great host - she was quick to respond to our questions and was very accommodating.  The suite was great for our needs, and it looks almost exactly as it appears in the pictures.    It is clear that this is a well-cared-for home. 
Our family of four wanted to see the sights in Seattle, but also to spend some precious time just being together, which the apartment allowed.  Having a kitchen was terrific - we had breakfast at ""home"" every day, and then were out until evening.  We made picnic lunches to go on two out of four days.  We bought fresh fish at the public market one day and cooked it at home that night, and then, since we had room to spread out, had the luxury of playing a family game after dinner.  What a treat! 
We had planned to use public transportation to get downtown, but found that between the big hill walk to the bus stop and my being out of shape, it was more convenient to use the car we had rented to get around, so being able to park at the apartment was a great feature. 
The neighborhood was very, very quiet, and we felt perfectly safe.  Hannah had made some helpful suggestions on places to eat, things to do, and how to get around the area.
This was a great experience, - we wish we could have stayed longer!  We definitely recommend this rental.
Thank you, Hannah!"
6576228,39766579,2015-07-26,34402197,Doug,The space was great and as advertised.  Everyone was very pleased.  The host had information at hand for getting around town.  Very helpful.  Enjoyed our stay.
6576228,41756921,2015-08-09,34537742,Lindsay,Four of us stayed at Hannah's condo while we were in town for a wedding at the Seattle Aquarium.  Hannah's place was very comfortable and close to everywhere we wanted and needed to go.  We were able to explore the neighborhood and nearby places on foot and it was a great location to be able to grab a quick Uber to other locations.  Hannah was nice to work with - she made our arrival very easy and provided a lot of great restaurant suggestions.  We really enjoyed having Hannah's condo as our home base for a weekend in Seattle!
6576228,43923806,2015-08-23,34507808,Gerhard,"Hannah made us the best welcome to Seattle which is possible. A good located house, clean and quiet. There was really everything you need for cooking in the kitchen (better than in my own kitchen :-)). Spices, tomatoes, juice, coffee, milk, ... . Thank you Hannah for the good wine, I enjoyed him in the evening.

We started our tour with a walk to Fremont. On the next day we went to Pikes Market and to the Space Needle.  The bus stop to downtown is close to the house, but there is also space for the car in front of the house.

If we ever come back to Seattle we would stay again in this place."
6576228,55114501,2015-11-28,23469962,Mary,"Four of us stayed at Hannah's condo while we were in town for Thanksgiving. Hannah's place was very comfortable and close to everywhere we wanted and needed to go. She left us lots of treats and a nice bottle of wine! It was a great place to relax after touring around town all day.
"
5252543,34368927,2015-06-07,23304333,Mariel,"Ali and Dirk were great. They made me feel very welcomed. Since this location is in family friendly community outside the city, it can be a bit tricky getting around if don't have a car.  It took me about 45 minutes to get to and from the city on the bus. Once you figure out the bus route, it can be very convenient for daytime excursions. 

The house has a stunning view of the water and is very peaceful and tranquil at sunset. Their dog Neva was a big ol' sweetheart.
The room was clean and cozy - the perfect size for a solo traveler. 
 I was very happy with my stay. 
"
5252543,35947503,2015-06-23,22336953,Kitt,Ali & Dirk were very kind and generous hosts.  The room and bed were comfortable and looks just like photos.  I had a car and the location was close enough to the studio I was attending a training at.  I would stay with them again.
5252543,42964701,2015-08-16,23197134,Douglas,"Ali and Dirk are awesome! I was driving in from San Francisco and at the mercy of fluctuating traffic conditions. Dirk worked around my arrival and met me at the house on a weekday while he was working. The WiFi is great, the house is clean and I have to say the downstairs unit where I slept was one of the coziest places I've been on AirBnB. I normally have trouble sleeping somewhere new, but I was out like a light every night while I was in town. I actually took pictures of the bed frame, pillows and sheets so I can try to find some for myself. Ali and Dirk were gracious and helpful hosts, and I never experienced any feeling of being ""underfoot"" in someone else's home. A great stay that I'll visit again next time I'm in Seattle. And Neeva is an adorable dog! The reading selection in the room was formidable and perfect for bedtime. "
5252543,47820339,2015-09-21,41002943,Edward,"Dirk and Ali were very welcoming and friendly.  They have a beautiful house in a nice, quiet area of West Seattle.  Dirk and Ali were both very accommodating.  And they have a great dog!  "
5252543,48586793,2015-09-27,2548094,Tom,"Excellent Hosts!  Ali and Dirk's place is wonderful and they were gracious and flexible.  We were attending a wedding at The Hall at Fauntleroy, which is a quick drive down the hill from their house.  The location was perfect for us with a nice view of the sound, and it wasn't too hard to drive into downtown.  The bus also runs right in front of their house.  Nice accommodations and comfortable bed!"
5252543,56101624,2015-12-08,45488144,John,Dirk and Ali are great hosts. The place was very comfortable and clean. Will stay again on my next trip to Seattle! 
7956227,44511740,2015-08-26,20901424,Richard,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7956227,46208714,2015-09-08,7139952,Annie,"Mae was very nice and our stay at her apartment was excellent! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect and easy to get to; it's just a couple minutes uphill walk from the Pioneer square. I stayed for a long weekend, but I can recommend this place for a longer stay too. If I decide to visit Seattle in the future, I will defintely lookup Mae's apartment again. "
7956227,48255059,2015-09-24,1716088,Sarah,"We didn't meet Mae as we arrived late in the evening and she had kindly prepared everything for our arrival. We LOVED the apartment and can highly recommend it to other travellers. Excellent location - we walked to Stumptown for morning coffee and also to Pioneer Square, Pike Place, etc plus the restaurants along the Pike/Pine corridor. When we couldn't be bothered to walk back up the hill we got an über back which was so cheap from downtown. Mae was so friendly and helpful throughout our booking and stay and she has great taste in books/decor making the apartment a really nice space to be in. "
7956227,48473829,2015-09-26,37328626,Kelsey,"Wonderful experience. Mae made getting in and out a breeze, her place is ADORABLE, and in a super convenient location. There are pay to park lots all over so even though it's in a pretty busy area we had no issues with parking. 

Would highly recommend!!"
7956227,49523962,2015-10-04,6834781,Jeffrey,"Didn't get a chance to meet Mae in person, but she was always available to us and made check in/out super easy.

Great location close to several bus routes and walking distance to a couple cool neighborhoods in Seattle!"
7956227,50183227,2015-10-10,4491324,B.,"The apartment was so lovely.  I wish we could have stayed longer.  It felt very much like I was home.  I feel like the apartment was very comfortable.   It was also in a  wonderful neighborhood.  Lots of fun things to do within walking distance.  The building was very quiet, so we slept well.  This was a great place.  Mae was also very responsive and helpful.  "
7956227,51141107,2015-10-18,39539581,Miriam,"We loved Mae's apartment, it was beautifully furnished with a cool vintage style and felt very homey. It's at the top of a pretty steep hill so I recommend getting a cab there if you have heavy luggage (we found Uber to be cheap and easy to use). The street is fairly busy, and you can hear people coming and going in the apartment block so light sleepers might find this an issue (we didn't as we're used to city noise!)."
5751177,34906291,2015-06-13,16588810,John,"Chelsi and Jeremy are exceptional hosts that are both extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about Seattle, it's wonderful neighborhoods, its noteworthy sights and restaurants, and, of course, the cannabis industry. The bed and breakfast was incredibly comfortable, and they provided almost anything you could ask for, including a few exquisite gourmet meals and, of course, wonderfully hospitable company. Staying in West Seattle was very convenient for us, and it allowed us to visit a part of the city we may have not visited otherwise. I would highly recommend the 7 Leaf B&B, especially for those interested in learning about and sampling some of Seattle's best cannabis products and cannabis cuisine from one of the foremost experts."
5751177,35051168,2015-06-14,26062269,Weimin,"The host Chelsi is very nice. Our schedule changed, but Chelsi was kind enough to let us in apartment earlier. 
She has a fat chef. He can do lots of different kind of food, particularly Italian food. He had prepare a very good breakfast for us, even we leave at early morning. 

Thank you so much Chelsi. "
5751177,39975741,2015-07-27,34940778,Shae,Chelsi and Jeremy were very hospitable and made our stay in Seattle pleasant. They made sure we had plenty to eat and knew of all the places to check out in the city. The food was amazing and the beds were clean and comfortable. 
5751177,40549349,2015-07-31,39950559,Nicholas,"Jeremy and Chelsi were legendary hosts. Chelsi greeted me with a smile and showed me all the amenities--all up to par for the home of a master chef like Jeremy. He offered a wealth of knowledge about the world of cannabis and his involvement in the movement (sometimes hard to follow in my cloudy state!) Hospitality reaches all levels at this fine establishment. But I also commented early on in my visit that they produce a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for all guests, including those uninterested in cannabis. Jeremy, as a local chef, was able to guide us to some of the best restaurants in Seattle, which was very helpful for a newbie like me. I found my favorite seafood restaurant in the world, thanks to Jeremy (Seattle Fish Company, mmmmm!) And in the evening, a friend of Jeremy's came to visit, who happened to be a chef from California who joined him in the kitchen. Our breakfast of gourmet hash browns with cheese and chives, thick but crispy bacon, and thin gluten-free crepes with a pear and blueberry reduction was DELICIOUS! The 7 Leaf was also on the front page of a local newspaper this week, and I'm not surprised. On the morning of leaving, Chelsi casually asked if I'd like to give a phone interview to a popular news website about my stay at this bud'n'breakfast. Sure!"
5751177,41973407,2015-08-10,17930274,Juan,"They they great pride in making sure all of your needs are addressed. Luscious sleeping accommodations, readily available continental breakfast, and easy access to downtown and local fare make this a very reasonable place to stay, especially if you make use of services like Uber or Lyft."
5751177,42429622,2015-08-13,22002177,Graham,"Our time in Seattle staying at the 7 Leaf was wonderful from start to finish. From check in to checkout we were treated as family, with amazing food including oysters, gourmet burgers and risotto, not to mention heavenly desserts. Beds and bathroom were comfortable, communal areas welcoming. Parking nearby was easy. We enjoyed socialising with other guests and the 420 friendly policy was welcome, rather visionary and incorporated seamlessly into the experience. 
Chelsi and Jeremy are the perfect hosts and I look forward to staying again."
5751177,46056653,2015-09-07,42782959,Jamie,"Where to begin?! Chelsi and Jeremy were gracious hosts from the start, and made us feel at home immediately. Whether we needed pointers on where to go, what to eat, and how to get there, they were happy to assist and give us some of their recommendations. This was an impromptu trip for a couple of first timers, and our experience at 7 Leaf was everything we hoped for and more. If you stay with them be sure to get at least a couple of meals with them - Jeremy's cooking blew us away, and I can honestly say that we had one of the best dinners we've ever had on our first night there. You won't be disappointed with this gem. Can't wait for our next visit! "
5751177,47924904,2015-09-21,18934902,Sarah,"This place is great! It is in a cute part of West Seattle, not far from several shops and restaurants. Chelsi and the chef were both very nice, though since both were very busy with a food conference that weekend and I had a packed weekend myself, I didn't really get to enjoy the ""full hosting experience"" - which was fine, because we had discussed this in advance. It was still a great stay! The room was very cute, comfy bed, yummy snacks were provided, and everything was great! I would definitely stay here again, and recommend to others!"
1214316,4957376,2013-06-03,6646306,Lanora,"My daughter and I were in Seattle for the weekend, and needed a place to stay in the Fremont district. Jasmine and Steve accepted my request within a couple of hours, on the same day if travel.  
They are awesome hosts!!  We arrived pretty late, but they were waiting up for us, gave us wonderful advise on where to eat close to our destination, and gave awesome walking directions. I would most definitely stay here again. "
1214316,5068324,2013-06-10,6590223,Matthew,"Moving to Seattle for a new job, I needed a place to stay for a couple weeks to enable me to find a permanent home and become familiar with the city. 
This was the perfect airbnb and hosts to do just that. Jasmine and Steven are great people with a lot of good insights into the area. Accommodations are clean, comfortable, and have some nice character. Views are also great! 
The location is perfect for quiet nights but close to restaurants and shops. Additionally, bus stops are just a block or two away. 
I would highly recommend this airbnb! "
1214316,5286681,2013-06-22,6162470,Valerie,"Jasmine and Stephan were wonderful hosts. Gave us some good tips and made sure we were enjoying our stay. We did have to share a bathroom with the other guests but there was no problem with that as everyone was very respectful. Their place is in a great location to take a nice walk down to the hip Fremont, or just a short walk to a bus which brings you straight into downtown. There is a 7Eleven near by and wonderful park just a mile up the road where you can do all sorts of sports including renting Kayaks etc."
1214316,5528123,2013-07-04,6601377,Robert,"My wife and I had a very pleasant 12 night stay with Jasmine and Steve in June-July.  Perfect location for us to visit families in Ballard and even NE Seattle.  Sharing of bathroom was never an issue. Neighborhood and street seemed very safe - rental car trunk accidently left open overnight and nothing taken.  Even though both cool and several hot nights, air conditioning wasn't needed . . . open windows without screens were wonderful.  Bed was only issue as I am 6-3 and too long for futon mattress and hard wood ends shown in photo.  Jasmine indicated she would change as soon as possible.  She met me most mornings and evenings when coming and going to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything.  We would stay again and hope to get to know them better as well. ."
1214316,7076293,2013-09-05,8236945,Margaret,Jasmine and Steve were very welcoming. The location was ideal for getting to UW and the Seattle Center. The room was clean and comfortable and the shared bathroom and kitchenette were just steps away. I would stay here again. 
1214316,7179336,2013-09-09,8520980,Craig,"Jasmine and Steven were wonderful hosts. The room was perfect for us (two guests), and the place is well situated. Fremont is lovely, and it was easy to get around to other parts of the city. Great stay."
1214316,7403260,2013-09-18,4923813,Chad,"This is a beautiful house and fantastic room in an awesome neighborhood. 

Steven and Jasmine couldn't be more accommodating. Would definitely do this again!"
1214316,7560090,2013-09-24,5051508,Mary,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here immensely. The hosts were very accommodating and interesting to talk with. Great location, great hospitality. We would definitely stay here again!"
1214316,7633530,2013-09-27,8771911,Randy,"Steve and Jasmine were great hosts and a lovely family. They were also able to accommodate my change in reservations, at the last minute. My room was also great and in a nice neighborhood. Clean, lots of space, with a very comfy bed. I enjoyed the little treats of fruit and snack bar. I would stay here again."
1214316,7673714,2013-09-29,4160737,Tonia,"My husband, 23-month-old son, and I enjoyed our stay in the Great Room - this was our first Airbnb stay, and the process was so easy. Jasmine and Stephen were friendly and suggested some great restaurants in the area. The room was big and clean, and they accommodated our needs by setting up a futon mat for our son on the floor in our room."
1214316,7818830,2013-10-04,8812256,Ann,"We enjoyed our stay at Jasmine and Stephen's house. They have a beautiful older Wallingford home in a very inviting neighborhood for walking and looking at established, well-maintained yards and gardens. Jasmine and Stephen were very welcoming and helpful. Our corner room had a comfortable bed, with a nice view. We would highly recommend this place to others!"
1214316,7952340,2013-10-09,8144042,Dan,"Steve and Jazmine are great hosts, shared some great spots and gave me great directions around as well. Very cool and interesting people. Thumbs up 8)"
1214316,7992326,2013-10-11,3738974,Sophie,"We had a fantastic time in Seattle staying at Jasmine and Stephens cozy home. Great location, wonderful hosts. Really nice balance of having our own space but also chatting and getting good tips on things to do in the area. Would love to visit again."
1214316,8272112,2013-10-22,8957083,Zenaida,"We were nicely and warmly met by Stephen and Jasmine on our late pm arrival. The room was warm and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very clean with abundance of organic toiletries. It is very convenient to public transportation. The streets are mostly flat, therefore, they are great for people with walking problems like me.  We were happy with the accommodation. We may spend the nights here again should we make another visit."
1214316,8331553,2013-10-26,9060372,Ron,"We were meet at the door with a welcoming smile after a late Amtrak arrival. The upstairs accommodations offer both a large room and a small room that share a full bath room with clawfoot tub/shower. Our room was spacious and the bed comfortable. I even found a pillow that suited me, which is quite unusual. Fresh fruit and granola bar snacks, water, a microwave, and coffee/tea fixings were available. The location is well placed to keep you far enough away from the main roadway to get a sound sleep, but close enough to catch the bus you need after an invigorating stroll through a nice Wallingford neighborhood. Wi-Fi was available and provided trouble-free connection for our devices. We had a nice stay at a great price and would recommend it to anyone needing accommodations near Fremont, SPU, and UW."
1214316,8419946,2013-10-29,3405946,Tong,We had dinner with a friend in Olympia and didn't face the traffic up to Seattle until 7 but had no trouble checking in after 8. There were restaurants and a good grocery store with easy walking distance up on 45th. There were some great Halloween decorations on the street. The no-shoe policy keeps a home much cleaner but I was glad we brought slippers to keep our feet warm indoors and would recommend the same to anyone visiting in the cooler months.
1214316,8628730,2013-11-09,6405395,Jalita And Max,"Jasmine was an amazing guest, welcoming and friendly. The room was just perfect - Really close to shops, restaurant and street markets.
Fremont is beautiful so Jasmine's place could not be better located.

Thanks guys and see you soon!"
1214316,8725470,2013-11-13,9176360,Cindy,"My partner & I stayed two nights with Jasmine & Stephen mid November 2013.  They are very gracious hosts and their home fulfilled our needs - a comfortable, quiet room in a heritage home that is within easy access to downtown, restaurants, a Veteran's Day ceremony, a movie theatre and more.  "
1214316,8841944,2013-11-20,873658,Fernando,What a great little find :)  Really enjoyed my stay and was the perfect place for me to focus in and do my work in Seattle.  Thanks!
1214316,9922905,2014-01-19,165390,Seth,"A very comfortable place to spending the evening.  The little kitchenette setup was nice too, though I took advantage of the proximity to Fremont to check out that neighborhood."
1214316,10327271,2014-02-13,2083587,Renee,"We loved the location near so many good restaurants and a short walk to bus transportation to anywhere we wanted to go. The Blue Star on Stone Way, just north of 45th Street, is a great breakfast place.
It snowed while we were there, We greatly enjoyed our walk from the bus in the beautiful snow. The cold weather made us very grateful for the terrific heater in our room so we could control the temperature ourselves. The bed was so comfy, it was hard to get up in the morning. We were glad we had slippers to accommodate the removal of shoes at the door.
Jasmine, Steven and Blaze were wonderful hosts and were very accommodating of our needs. Blaze is a charmer and an accomplished flirt."
1214316,10578748,2014-02-25,2450642,Noah,"I recently got a job in Seattle and needed a place to land my feet so that I could get going. I came across Jasmine's place and stayed there for a week. It's in a good central location,  you can easily get to Ballard, the U district,  or capitol hill fairly easily. The place is nice, an older home but nevertheless unique. Jasmine is kind enough to leave you out snacks and tea outside your door so that you can easily grab something on your way out. Her and her husband are very kind and I enjoyed my stay."
1214316,10691734,2014-03-03,373263,Marcy,I greatly enjoyed my stay with Jasmine and family.  I will stay with them again if I ever have need to stay in this area of Seattle.
1214316,10856196,2014-03-10,3276201,Nick,Wonderful hosts and room. Really enjoyed being within walking distance of Wallingford. 
1214316,11034078,2014-03-17,2366121,Robyn,"We had a very nice stay (5 nights). The room was spacious, the neighborhood was lovely and the hosts were friendly. "
1214316,11099485,2014-03-20,10997496,Kara,I had a great stay with Jasmine and Stephen. They have a beautiful house and everything about the trip was very convenient. Highly recommend.
1214316,12023326,2014-04-21,8009341,Stephanie,"It should be noted that they have a huge cat, which would be fine, except the the entire house has a lingering smell of cat litter.

Room is large and spacious.  Neighborhood is safe and away from downtown."
1214316,12544910,2014-05-05,13172975,Edward,"The room was very spacious and is up on the 2nd floor of a home in a peaceful and safe neighbourhood. Jasmine and Stephen were very nice and welcoming. Everything you need is on one floor - the bathroom, a mini-fridge, they also provide some snacks if you are hungry! With good public transport, getting around is very easy and fast. It was essentially a very pleasant stay and I recommend others to stay there as well! "
1214316,13540414,2014-05-30,5405700,Jason,"My wife and I stayed here last week and it was fantastic. Nice, clean room in a beautiful residential neighborhood in Wallingford (a short walk Fremont) and an easy commute the U-District or downtown by bus. We're looking into moving to Seattle now, so I'd say this was a successful stay.

Jasmine and Steven were nice, really flexible with out scheduled check in and out, and provided some yummy granola bars."
1214316,13772156,2014-06-03,15113650,Alma,"We had a nice stay in Jasmine´s place. Even if she was outside the city, she left a house-sitter and was easy to contact in case something happpened. 
The room is very comfortable, and as seen in the pictures. Jasmine provides with coffee, tea ans snacks, which is great after a long day visiting town. 
The neighbourhood was nice and only some minutes from downtown by car. 
I recommend staying here!."
1214316,13854593,2014-06-06,4232219,Jane,"Jasmine's place was very nice.  It's located on a very nice looking and quiet street.  The room was airy and bright and had plenty of room to stretch out.  We didn't get to meet Jasmine in person, but she was very communicative and helpful in our text/airbnb communications.  We briefly met her husband, who was very nice and friendly."
1214316,14088214,2014-06-11,3276201,Nick,"Great experience as always-- this was our 2nd time using Jasmine's place and I'm sure we'll keep her in mind for the future! Clean, friendly, and well located pretty much sums it up for us."
1214316,14486332,2014-06-20,14943776,Chris,"I stayed at Jasmine's house for a bit more than a week and had an awesome stay. Her upstairs room is nice and spacious and there is a really comfortable reclined couch to just lay back and relax after a long day of work. The location of the house made it very easy to get to Fremont by walking and Seattle by bus, so finding things to do over the weekends was not a problem! The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and I had no problem walking back home late at night."
1214316,14825287,2014-06-27,5258261,Olga Valle,"Clean and simple accommodations in a lovely neighborhood -- exactly what we needed for our trip.  Jasmine and her husband, Stephen, were wonderful hosts, very friendly, thoughtful, and attentive.  "
1214316,14919319,2014-06-29,15162122,INing,Thank for nice house.
1214316,15044566,2014-07-01,15402017,Sarah,"Stephen met me at the check-in time. He was very kind, helping me carry my luggage upstairs. Jasmine and Stephen provided snacks, filtered water, and all the fixings for tea.The bedroom was charming and the natural lighting was lovely. At night the neighborhood was quiet. Just note: this is an older house and some people might be more bothered than others by its musty smell."
1214316,15985003,2014-07-19,16009479,Brooke,"The room was cute and cozy. Our host had a house-sitter during our stay, which was fine. The only issue we had was the shared bathroom. Five people using one bathroom turned out to be quite the inconvenience. When my friend and I arrived, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes (we timed it) for us to be able to use the bathroom because two girls took extremely long showers back to back. We were consistently having to wait when we needed to brush our teeth, use the toilet, or shower. Once the house-sitter even knocked on the door when my friend was showering to ask for her toothbrush! If you don't mind waiting times and have no appointment times during your stay, it won't be a problem, but for us it was very inconvenient. Given the price I would expect a private bath or at least one shared by fewer people."
1214316,16836956,2014-08-03,16444718,Eun Jeong,"위치도 나쁘지 않구요. 주인 아저씨가 상냥하시구. 방도 적당히 크고 깨끗합니다.
화장실이 한층에 하나라 6명이 같이 써야해서
불편한 적도 있었지만 화장실도 깨끗하고
무료로 샤워용품, 수건을 사용 할수있어서 참 좋았습니다. 여행자들을 위해 따로 작은 스넥코너가 있는데 물, 커피, 크런치바를 제공 받아 편했습니다."

1214316,17266248,2014-08-10,12722274,Anne-Marie,"Jasmine and Steve were very nice hosts. They were helpful, had good suggestions, great with our children, generally friendly and approachable! The room was clean and cozy. They even provided an extra floor futon for our daughter. They had a fridge, toaster, snacks and teas for guests by the room.The house is well located, away but very close to downtown, in a great neighborhood. Thanks again guys!"
1214316,17827008,2014-08-18,14811183,"Seán (Aka John, Eoin)","Hmm, what to say about the experience here at this beautiful house with these beautiful souls living here? Nothing but pure beauty! From the moment before stepping on the property to when I parted ways, the Clan and the house had been nothing but gracious to me. It is truly remarkable to have human souls like the Clan. They bent over backwards and invited me into their humble home and made me apart of their family. They gave the skinny on their beautiful house and I enjoyed every moment of it here with them. 

As far as I'm concerned, I would rate my experience as a five star experience here (five being the highest, zero the lowest). If you want an elaboration further into it, zero would be austere (i.e., overseas Afghanistan and Iraq). Many deployments to sand and drastic temperature changes make one really appreciate the little things in life. This house and this stay with these three souls was nothing more than spectacular. 

I hope that you as the reader don't take this with a grain of salt, but take it as truth. Yes, human experiences vary, but when you come here to this house and stay with these beautiful souls, you know already you are home.

Thank you, once again, Clan of Bay! "
1214316,18334242,2014-08-25,13200676,James,"Our hosts made us feel very welcome and the room was clean, airy and comfortable.  Nice touch to have some area information and coffee/tea/snack area outside in the hall.  We enjoyed the location near Green Lake and the Fremont area.  The Great Room was perfect for our Seatlle visit.  "
1214316,18508416,2014-08-27,13111863,Nicole,"Jasmine & Steven were so friendly and easy going, which made our stay very pleasant. The house is situated near Fremont street, which is a fun area with lots of great restaurants and the room itself was quite spacious. We're planning on staying there again next time we're in Seattle. :)"
1214316,18989651,2014-09-04,2752604,Christina,"When we arrived Jasmine showed us around and gave us information about the neighborhood and had maps available for local sights.  The location was super convenient to everything we wanted to do and parking was always easy.  The space was clean and comfortable.  Jasmine had everything easily accessible which was a nice touch. We loved the delicious smell that was always wafting through the house.  It made for a very cozy and homey environment, while also hunger inducing.  :-)  Stephen was great to chat with the couple of times we had the opportunity.   We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this listing to others.  "
1214316,19108327,2014-09-06,933989,Ines,"Staying at Jasmines was great! The room is very spacious and clean. They take great care of their guests, providing organic tea/coffee and snacks and even toys for the baby!They are both very friendly and gave us great recommendations on where to go out for dinner. It's easy to get downtown, yet it's in a very quiet neighborhood!"

1214316,20394100,2014-09-28,20460887,Tony,Very nice couple who made me feel welcome and made sure I had everything I needed! Room was comfortable and clean with a cool window nook that's grest for reading by. House is a quick walk away from downtown Fremont and bus lines to get elsewhere in Seattle. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others!
1214316,20588840,2014-10-01,21801675,Christine,"I stayed with Jasmine and Stephen for a few days while checking out Seattle for the first time. It was a very pleasant stay. The hosts were very friendly and chatted with me for a bit and were very chill about my comings and goings. 

I enjoyed the small touches (breakfast and tea were great) and the room was very cozy. "
1214316,21368759,2014-10-15,13111863,Nicole,"My boyfriend and I have stayed with Jasmine & Stephen before and will probably stay there again, the next time we're in Seattle.  The house is in an awesome location, walking distance to great restaurants and shops.  I highly recommend staying there!"
1214316,22064649,2014-10-29,9212728,Roger,Our host was friendly and helpful.  The room was very nice.  The neighborhood was great.
1214316,22388264,2014-11-04,23150177,Dominique,"We were warmly welcomed (and we arrived late, very appreciate that!) and our host gave us good advice/suggestions about the surroundings that ended to be very usefull. The location of the house is good, easy to get to domntown by bus (plenty of choice at almost any time) and not very expensive by taxi from the downtown. The Fremont neighbourhood is lovely, quiet but at the same thing plenty restaurants and cafes.
Altough, we went during the last week of October and is was cold outside.. and inside. As the house is not heated (at least not the second floor were the room and bathroom are), our room was cold and moist. We had to turn the individual heater to the maximum to be a bite comfy in the room abd to try to keep our cloths and the bed dry. But as we had to turn the heater off we not there, our cloths and the bed were moist and cold.
For the price/value, we were pretty desapointed. For 87$, we would expect decent pillows, a warm room for our arrival, to be able to keep our things dry and no mold on the bathroom sellings.
To have known, we would have paid just a little extra to be in a hotel. But I'm sure that it's different during summer time."
1214316,23879628,2014-12-13,21413769,Julia,"they were very welcoming and solicitous as to my comfort. I arrived late and in heavy rain and they were very nice about that even though they had a young child. the neighborhood is cool and easy to get to restaurants and shops. the room is large and light filled, the furnishings, though spartan, were very comfy and useful - big table, sofa and easy chair. the bed was very comfortable and the sheets and pillows were soft and nice. The room has its own guest controlled (email hidden) should be turned on a couple of hours before retiring but then the room is plenty nice and warm. Coffee, tea, fruit and snacks on landing outside of room. The bath is shared but Jasmine provides a very nice shampoo, conditioner and bath gel which is great given the TSA restrictions. plenty of towels et al. Parking was really easy. very nice experience for the price."
1214316,24007429,2014-12-16,24387267,Tom,"Jasmine and Stephen were great hosts - welcoming & courteous.  The house, despite being in a quiet, residential neighborhood is well connected by transit and there are several restaurants and stores within walking distance.  Getting to downtown and the airport is easy.  It's a great old house with lots of character.  "
1214316,24346911,2014-12-26,404429,Wes,Had a wonderful stay..  Bed and futon worked well for us.  Stephen and Jasmine  were friendly and helpful.  Would stay again on future.
1214316,24850961,2015-01-03,17821190,Ana,Our stay was very cool. Jasmine really made us feel comfortable at her place at the same time that we had our own space. I'd absolutely stay here again.
1214316,25283752,2015-01-11,327590,Eileen,Cute home and clean room with lots of small amenities. The room is very spacious and the hosts were really responsive and helpful with all my questions. Would recommend!
1214316,25519660,2015-01-18,25774575,Meliz,"Our stay was amazing! Jasmine & Stephen were very helpful and accommodating. Even though we had arrived much earlier than check in time, they graciously let us drop off our stuff! The room was clean and included a pretty view of the Seattle skyline. We were also only a few blocks from bus lines, which made travel very easy - we used this place as our home base throughout our trip! I would definitely stay here again upon our return to Seattle :)"
1214316,26063875,2015-02-02,5525405,Thu-Mai,"Jasmine and Stephen are very nice and immediately made me feel  comfortable. The house is clean, the electric heater in the room worked well for me. "
1214316,26375048,2015-02-10,24490710,Eric,"The room was as described and Jasmine was a great host! The bed was comfortable, and the room had a great view of Seattle. "
1214316,27364316,2015-03-02,22581122,Jenny,"I felt very welcome at the home. The neighborhood was great, and the house was light and airy. The hosts helped me select a restaurant in a fun neighborhood for a business meeting. Great experience, I would book again!"
1214316,27991720,2015-03-16,16745905,Penelope,"We had a wonderful time staying at Jasmine's for the week! It has great access to buses, restaurants, shops, downtown! Jasmine and Stephen were amazing hosts and were always willing to help out if we needed anything! "
1214316,28526841,2015-03-25,26384511,Stephen,"Jasmine and Stephen were great hosts.  They were very accommodating and easy to talk to.  The rooms are exactly how they are listed, clean and comfortable.  It was nice to know that they are flexible with the check in times since we had some delays on the way their.  Overall, I would recommend staying here."
1214316,29865202,2015-04-13,29404743,Katie,"This was my first AirBnB experience, so I was a little uncertain about what to expect. However, upon arrival any uncertainties were quickly allayed. Jasmine and Stephen was incredibly communicative throughout the process: giving advice on public transportation, places to eat, the urban map of Seattle, as well as thoughtfully checking in to make sure I was having a great experience. Another amenity I loved was a cute little kitchen/snacks area that all guests could share. 
The room I was in was extremely comfortable with a bed and sofa. My favorite part of the room however, was the window seat that over looked the front of the house. I spent mornings sitting and looking at the sliver of a downtown skyline and all the beautiful flowers and trees in springtime bloom. 
Lastly, the neighborhood is adorable with restaurants, gyms, coffeehouses, Gilman-Burke trail, waterfront views, and the UW all  easily walkable, cyclable, or busable. "
1214316,30522580,2015-04-23,5371365,Tamsen,"A sunny, airy and spacious warm room with a comfortable bed in a pleasant residential neighbourhood. The house is within easy walking distance of many cafes, restaurants markets and shops. Bus stops also are close.  Jasmine and Stephen kindly answered my many questions about Seattle and provided me with a desk. I didn't see much of them but they seem very interesting. This is a calm place to stay."
1214316,33886263,2015-06-01,1927137,Jen,"I recommend staying here! Jasmine and Stephen are helpful and attentive hosts, but also give you plenty of room to do your own thing.  The room is spacious, bright, clean, calm, and has a great view of the neighborhood and city. The location is great too-- walking distance to places to eat in the neighborhood and a number of bus lines. Enjoy!"
1214316,34890900,2015-06-13,10539221,Kevin,Jasmine was very kind to accommodate our tight schedule at Seattle.  Her house was gorgeous and very pleasant to stay.  I would recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here.
1214316,35101858,2015-06-15,32548217,Lynn,"The listing was 100% accurate. It was an upstairs room in their home with access to a mini fridge, snacks, and the bathroom. Jasmine was very welcoming. She was available to give me my key even with me showing up hours after check-in with no notice. They explained everything and I was free to come and go as I needed. This was my first AirBnB experience and based of this stay I'll definitely do it again."
1214316,35342358,2015-06-17,35329960,Derek,Jasmine was very helpful in communicating with us on our arrival. Left water/snacks/shampoo etc for us to use. They made sure to check in with us even though we arrived late to make sure we were comfortable. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our experience in the neighborhood as well as their home. 
1214316,35595195,2015-06-20,7463805,Spencer,"The stay was excellent - the place was very nice and just as described.  Easy to get keys, and they offered some muffins and granola bars in the morning which were excellent.  Their child played some instruments in the morning, which we didn't mind as we were not planning on staying in the apartment past the morning.  I would highly recommend their place."
1214316,37842296,2015-07-11,13755591,Nicole,"Jasmine was very good about staying in communication and advising me about the check-in process.  She was out of town but she had her friend meet me and it was very easy.  The room was a lot more spacious than I expected and perfect for my needs.  It is on the second story, which was not a problem for me but something to be aware of.  There is no access to a common area (i.e. living room or kitchen) but these were not necessary for me.  I really only slept there and it was great.  You couldn't really beat the price!  I have no complaints!"
1214316,38222007,2015-07-13,37713095,Rob,"Jasmine and Steve were great hosts!  From the time I arrived to the time I checked-out they were great.  The room was comfortable and  clean.   The bed was very comfortable.  Great Neighborhood very easy to get to the downtown area.  Thanks again!  I am looking forward to my next stay.

1214316,39060456,2015-07-20,255350,Elaine,"We needed extra directions to find Jasmine's place as it's in Wallingford; not U District. Jasmine helped when we called. It's a good location close to Green Lake, Fremont & not far from Ballard. They definitely need curtains for the room if you hope to sleep past 6 a.m. Sun shines directly in your face around that time, so no sleeping in."
1214316,39504382,2015-07-24,34818682,Teresa,"My whole experience at Jasmine's elegant house was fantastic. Jasmine was excellent about communicating arrival information. The neighbourhood was quiet and very safe-feeling. Buses, coffee shops and places to eat were all within close walking distance. Green Lake and its adjoining park were 20 minutes away. The room itself was spacious, clean and wonderfully bright. Bed extremely comfortable. Jasmine and Stephen could not have been better hosts.   They provided tea, coffee, granola bars and oatmeal for breakfast.  The small fridge was invaluable as were the bus timetables and maps . Plus Stephen and Jasmine were so helpful and accommodating.  This was my first time at airbnb.  So much more preferable to an hotel. I shall definitely stay there again when I return to Seattle."
1214316,40123678,2015-07-28,337902,Martin,"Jasmine and Stephen were super hosts. They received us at the scheduled time, showed us the accommodations and gave us the liberty to move freely. The room was as described. The house is located to walking distance to Freemont, where you will find cool places to hang out, dinner, coffee shops, etc. 
I would recommend their place. "
1214316,41230148,2015-08-05,12938048,Erin,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Jasmine's. The room was just as described, and a great place to come back to after a long day in the city. There were always ample coffee and snacks for us to enjoy. I also loved the claw foot tub in the bathroom!"
1214316,43479064,2015-08-20,5581384,Kristin,I had a great two week stay at Jasmine's! The location is great in an awesome neighborhood very near downtown. I would stay again 
1214316,44332656,2015-08-25,14478616,Reid,"The listing was accurate, and the host made our stay very pleasant.  She was clear about rules and available amenities. She made a lot of snacks available."
1214316,45249506,2015-09-01,28274355,Emma,"Jasmine and Stephen were lovely and thoughtful hosts. Stephen waited up for us, even we arrived at their house close to midnight. Despite that, he took the time to give us a quick tour of the room, the bathroom, and the well-stocked kitchenette. Everything was clean and comfortable, and we felt very at home there.  A few days later, Jasmine kindly let me use the backyard to do a test run with my tent, since I was going camping the following day. All around a great experience and an easy stay!

The neighborhood is quite nice, too: quiet, easy access to a bus that reaches downtown in 15-20 minutes, and with quite a few cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants and bars within walking distance."
1214316,49435327,2015-10-04,20741723,Eva,"It was - once again - a great experience. The room was very comfortable, in a perfect location, and Jasmine and Steve did what they could to make things easier.  "
1214316,50528360,2015-10-12,6550387,Beth,"Quint older but very well maintained home in a great location. We were within walking distance of  food, coffee, and fun.  The hosts provided generous amenities in the form of organic or healthy coffee, tea and snacks. We had a comfortable and pleasant stay!"
1214316,51485481,2015-10-20,4479276,Nick,"My girlfriend, Kristine and I really enjoyed out stay at Jasmine & Stephens place. Though we only met Stephen, he was very kind and courteous when we first showed up. He gave us both a tour of the place. Let us know what was in the area. They're favorite pizza n burger joints. Apart from being such a cool host. The room has such a great view of downtown. The beds insanely comfortable. They would leave out a basket of snacks and energy bars outside of your door which was great. The neighborhood is so nice n peaceful.  15 min walk to the Park n Zoo. Loved it"
1214316,56808672,2015-12-18,41158892,Paige,"I had a wonderful time staying in Jasmine and Stephen's home. It was comfortable, inviting and quiet, which was perfect. They were also absolutely fantastic, super friendly hosts. Definitely chat with them if you get the chance. A+!"
1214316,57179496,2015-12-22,29740070,Bryan,Had a great time here! Our hosts were wonderful and very welcoming. They were very kind and had a nice breakfast snack/coffee/tea area that was great. 
8129676,46666213,2015-09-12,12163206,Jenna,"Tyler was very nice and accommodating - times were flexible and he met us at the apartment when we wanted to check in. The apartment met our needs for a quick one night stay. The building is a little older, but works for the price. Location is great, an easy walk to Pike's and downtown."
8129676,46972817,2015-09-14,27138715,Abel,"Tyler was a great host. The apartment was nice and clean, plus cold beer in the fridge! :) Almost everything worth seeing in downtown is in walking distance. I would defenietly stay at his place again. "
8129676,47331780,2015-09-17,38292272,Jacob,"Perfect simple accommodation for exploring Seattle. I was able to take the Link train and walk easily to the place. 
Tyler was very quick to respond and answered all my questions. He also was accommodating with my short notice request as well as our unsure arrival time. 
Great value for the location, I would stay again. Also the pizza downstairs is excellent!"
8129676,48024025,2015-09-22,11494253,Jesús,"Tyler was great communicating with us prior to our arrival. He gave us clear directions to the apartment and was there waiting for us to hand us the key when we got there. The apartment was the perfect size and location for our base as we explored Seattle over the weekend. There were awesome restaurants nearby, the pier, Pike Place Market, and it was easily accessible from the light-rail system that goes straight to the airport. Tyler keeps his apartment clean, furnished with the essentials (clean towels and refreshing beer). We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to explore Downtown Seattle by foot, cab, or Uber.  "
8129676,49035984,2015-09-30,23296691,Bruce,Tyler cleaned up the apartment for us and provided access to his home. He was a good communicator and responsive when we asked him for advice on sightseeing and good eats in Seattle. Nice touch on the beer in the fridge. 
8129676,49662716,2015-10-05,43826720,Keith,"The place came as advertised and was exactly what my buddy and I needed. It was clean and cozy, close to Safeco Field and Pike Street Market, and there was a  pizza place downstairs. The host was quick to respond and very accommodating. "
4892529,38013293,2015-07-12,2157474,Jason,"Grace was very responsive with my inquires and requests. The layout was perfect for our group as we were starting a bike race in the morning and having easy access to the garage was ideal. Neighborhood was quite, but easy to walk a few blocks to get food or shop at Wholefoods"
4892529,39070477,2015-07-20,37266441,Matt,"The neighbourhood was very nice but that is honestly all I can say about my experience. My friends and I (7 of us in total) stayed here for a total of two nights. We checked in late on the first night and were horrified to find spiderwebs and spiders in over 8 corners of the basement suite. We immediately contacted Grace via text to address our concerns - my girlfriend especially has a phobia of spiders and was freaking out during our entire stay there. Given that it was close to midnight there was not much that Grace could do which was understandable. However we mentioned that we would like to check out immediately the next day and she acknowledged that via text.

The next morning we immediately contacted Grace to see if we could get a refund for the second night. It was not a cheap stay as we had paid close to $800 for the two nights. It took us while to reach her (she may have been at work) but her son finally called us back. We addressed our concerns but he insisted that he had cleaned the place and didn't believe what we had said. He would not discuss a refund unless we had evidence to show him. I thought that was extremely outrageous given that we had to get rid of all the spiders in the living quarter ourselves. It was a very uncomfortable stay as is and we were very offended to be questioned about our claims. After a while Grace came by personally and we showed her some of the remaining spiderwebs left behind. She acknowledged the situation but did not stay to properly address our concerns because her mother was waiting in the car (granted she was a senior and it was an extremely hot day). We tried to negotiate a refund with her (Airbnb's policy is 50%) for the single day but all she offered was $100, which felt like a huge slap in the face given the uncomfortable situation that we had to stay in. It really didn't make sense for us financially at that point so we had to swallow our pride and finish our stay. 

All in all, it honestly was one of the most disappointing Airbnb experiences that I have ever had. The posting shows 1,650sf and the  entire basement was nowhere close to that size (even counting for the garage). Two of the pictures posted were clearly not from the basement because they were not there (fireplace, dining table with a window). If you can show me where they are located in the basement I will rescind this entire review. The pillows were stained yellow with no covers and none of the bed sheets resembled anything as seen in the posting.  We PAID $800 for this place and we honestly feel very cheated from this experience. Not trying to bash on Grace but this is how all 7 of us felt..."

2593263,12313545,2014-04-28,10503280,James,"This is a great place. It's only a mile from the convention center, an easy walk, or the bus stop is one block away. The house is in a residential area but cafe's and other businesses are only a few blocks away, also Seattle University is right nearby.

The house for one thing was spotless!  Super comfortable and homey. Three bedrooms are upstairs with a full kitchen and living room downstairs. Full bathrooms are upstairs and downstairs. Each room has its own key and the front door has a keycode. The internet was super fast.

Paul is a great, interesting guy, very pleasant and very attentive. I was unsure how to get to the convention center, so after a tour of the house he also showed me the way down there and pointed out the sights along the way, suggesting restaurants and things not to miss seeing while I was there.

I would definitely stay here again.


"
2593263,13824750,2014-06-05,4794380,Sue Ellen,"I stayed in the Spring Street Center for a little over 2 weeks and had a good experience there. The house itself is in a great location and within walking distance of the great Capitol Hill area.

The house and room were clean when I arrived, and the house was cleaned during the week.  The room was a good size with a TV, air mattress, and futon bed for your choice of sleeping/lounging arrangements. I wouldn't go by the picture b/c there aren't additional chairs or little tables, but I'm sure that can be arranged if you speak to Paul, who is a great host and makes sure your stay is going well throughout. 

There are two bathrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs.  Both are cleaned often, but remember, you are sharing with other people staying in the house, so be sure to clean up a little after yourself. Same goes for the full functional kitchen. 

Overall, a nice stay for this traveling RN needing a place to stay while getting acclimated to Seattle living!"
2593263,14169732,2014-06-13,5451071,Simon,"In short: Paul provided not only a great room but also a very pleasant and welcoming start to living in this town.

I have moved to Seattle for six months to do research in computer-science and in that context needed a place to stay while searching for more permanent housing.
The Subud House is in a nice and quiet neighborhood within walking distance of a lot of great things in the Capitol Hill part of town, the house itself has all you need in terms of amenities, it has a nice little patio where I was so fortunate to have breakfast at while the sun was out and the birds chirping, how amazing is that?
Paul was a great host, providing a great place but also told a bunch of things, introducing me to the city showing me around the neighborhoods, helping me out with a lot of stuff.
I have only the highest recommendations to this place and its host!"
2593263,14496776,2014-06-20,12423821,Ian,"Great place to stay. Close to all of the action on Capitol Hill, but far enough away to be quiet at night. Paul was a considerate host and the room was clean and well stocked with everything needed for a good stay. "
2593263,15419409,2014-07-08,16971296,Nikhil,"We had a very pleasant stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were clean and well appointed. The house is in a very safe and prime location, close to everything. Parking was easy to find on the street outside the house. Thanks Paul for accommodating us in your wonderful house and making our trip to seattle a success! Highly recommended and Spring street center will be our first choice to stay in Seattle when we visit again. "
2593263,15552729,2014-07-11,17381686,Katherine,"The house was darling and so near public transportation. It was a cinch getting around seattle and a lovely, quiet spot to stay. We met Paul late night when he came over to see to fixing something (showing his dedication) and he was so sweet and welcoming. He even gave us his own private tour of seattle, which was perfect. Definitely a great spot to airbnb!"
2593263,16207755,2014-07-23,16219927,Israel,"Stayed at Paul's for 6 days. The place is nicely located, close to the bus routes and have restaurants that are within a mile radius. Getting there was also easy using the train and bus. Paul was very accommodating and the place was great overall. I am surely to return again. :)"
2593263,17220770,2014-08-09,17826630,Parvati,"Paul was very thorough in making sure that I was alright with regards to the front door, internet, etc. when I moved in the first day.  The room itself was clean and tidy. So were the shared spaces. The neighbourhood was well located and I made use of the easy access to ""Little Uncle"", a hole in the wall Thai restaurant near Paul's place. All in all, a great experience! Thanks Paul! "
2593263,17463108,2014-08-12,11355176,Young,"Awesome place to stay.
Close walk to bus routes and easy to get here by train from the airport.
Everything you need for an affordable stay near downtown without paying the hefty hotel premiums. 
Bathrooms and showers are shared with 3 other rooms but they are clean, well kept and located on both floors.
If you want to save money, have a quiet neighborhood to sleep in and rest, and plan on spending most of your time out and about, then this may be a good for you.

Safe travels!!

2593263,17644693,2014-08-15,6865977,Erick,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in August. It was our first Airbnb experience and overall I thought it was a great decision. Paul, the host responded quickly to our initial request and accepted us newbies within a couple of days. He emailed us with information about checking in and the house rules as well as directions from SeaTac and to local hangouts.

Our arrival went smoothly. We never met our host as he was out of town, but instructions were laid out as to where everything was in the house. There are 4 guest rooms in the house sharing 2 bathrooms.  The building is also used as a meeting place for a spiritual group but it wasn't being used the days we stayed there and we never saw anyone there for that purpose. I saw one of the other guests a couple of times and my partner met the occupants of the other rooms on their way out for the morning. I would describe the experience as almost fully private, especially if you don't expect to use the communal kitchen.

Bathroom:
The house is definitely older. The upstairs bathroom seems original to the house. The stand-up in-tub shower was a little awkward to work with but much more efficient than trying to kneel under the super low shower head of the downstairs bathroom. 

I tried to look up the information regarding the definition of ""Essentials"" and I didn't really get any information on Airbnb's website. Regardless there were ample towels, hand and face cloths and a supply of shampoo and body wash. There was also a hairdryer. I looked around briefly for an iron and ironing board but did not find one.

Bedroom:
We were in Room 2. It had a double bed with 4 pillows. Also in the room was a desk, luggage rack, a dresser hidden in one of the two closets, a chair, ample lightning, and 2 fans which were much appreciated considering it was 30 degrees Celsius the day we arrived. It also has two large windows that look down to the street. The door locks.  I had 3 pretty decent nights' sleep considering I've never slept in a shared double in more than a decade.

Shared spaces:
I didn't use the kitchen. There seemed like a lot of areas of the house that I shouldn't explore so I didn't. I wanted to catch a bit of a ball game I was following along with on my phone but noticed there was no ""living room"" of sorts.  We spent almost every non-sleeping/non-showering moment out on the town so it wasn't an issue.

Overall experience:
Great first Airbnb experience. In terms of value at this time of the year, amazing. So glad we stayed here. Lots of great bars in the neighborhood. Wifi!!!! Would I stay here again? Yes.

Thanks, Paul! Maybe next time. Go Jays!"
2593263,19630448,2014-09-15,20629557,Sairam,"Paul was extremely nice and courteous as a host. 
It was a wonderful experience meeting Sam Hamill who was also staying at Pauls for the night after a poetry reading.
The room was exactly as described in the posting. And I surprisingly found it more comfortable than I expected.
The room, the poetry reading and the sake made the first day nice and memorable.
The neighborhood on Capitol hill made it quite accessible to Seattle downtown by bus.
The place is spoilt for choice on cuisine and eateries. Another surprising find was the Elysian brewery just a walk away.
Not to mention the free parking from 14th-16th."
2593263,19976029,2014-09-21,20996193,Jesper,"My first experience with Airbnb. Never met the host but contact trough email and text message worked fine. The place was clean and quite comfortable. The rooms are not very soundproof so everything in the house was heard to the room.
The location was great. I walked to booth downtown and Lake union. Parking was free and easy to find on the street nearby. Close to Pike and Pine st with many restaurants and bars."

Es una muy buena opción si estas de paso por sesttle ."

Elliot Bay Books is just around the corner. The house itself was neat and tidy. The neighborhood wasn't noisy and Paul made sure we had everything we needed. We highly recommend staying here.

Getting there was easy and it was a 5 minute walk from the places we were visiting! We arrived a little bit early and had to go out to meet some friends, but our bed was made and room was set up when we came back! It was a very enjoyable stay! And having the $1 coffee/tea option in the kitchen was definitely a plus! We had no issues with anything and I will definitely be coming back to Spring Street Center in the future!"
2593263,33479169,2015-05-28,34017370,Jane,"We talked to Paul over email and messages. He was very friendly and welcoming. He explained to us how to appropriately use the house. The house was located very closely to Seattle University where I was planning to visit. Overall, it was a great experience. "
2593263,33617874,2015-05-30,3851803,Azul,"Paul is an amazing host. His place is really confortable, nice and located in a beautiful area close to Downtown Seattle. He picked me up from the station and took me to express tour in the city. Recommended me where to eat and where to take the bus. He was very helpful and nice."
2593263,33818552,2015-06-01,17264636,Clement,"My friends and I had a very nice weekend in Seattle staying at Paul's place. The room is really comfortable and spacious. Paul made a lot of effort to accommodate with our schedule.
Thanks!"
2593263,34309294,2015-06-07,31162357,Krissy,I had a wonderful stay at Paul's. The place was very clean and the other guests were lovely. The kitchen was large with staples like coffee and tea provided. I felt very safe staying here and feel it was in a decent location. 
2593263,34720637,2015-06-11,21795390,Ben,"This place is fantastic! My room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and there's a shared kitchen (shared with 3 other rooms) with everything you'll need as well. The fridge is separated into sections by room, so you can grab some cereal and milk for the mornings and be ready to explore Seattle as early as you want.

Paul was very helpful and responsive by email when I was planning my stay. I also had a chance to meet Paul (who doesn't live at the Center) briefly on the day before I left, and was shown round the other areas of the house that I hadn't yet seen.

As for location, it's on Capitol Hill; in the middle of super quiet neighborhood, but also only 5-10 minutes' walk away from a couple of super markets and some bars/eateries.

Getting to Downtown is also really easy - you're a block or two away from Pike Street which you can then follow all the way down to the public market - takes about 40 minutes if you've long legs.

I would recommend this to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
2593263,34971180,2015-06-14,32706108,Jennifer,"The room was exactly as advertised. It was clean and everything, including the air mattress which we had requested, was ready when we arrived. The house was located in a good neighborhood that allowed for easy traveling around Seattle. "

My only word of warning is that the neighborhood is quite loud. There was lots of airplane traffic. But, I didn't mind too much, and other than that the place was perfect!"
2593263,36781687,2015-07-01,16013801,Diep,"I didn't meet Paul during my trip there, but the experience was great nevertheless.  The instructions were very clear about how to access everything, and expectations for all guests were posted.  Everything was very clean.  I really appreciated how thorough Paul was.  The house was in walking distance to many restaurants and coffee shops.  Going downtown was a short and cheap Lyft ride.  Thanks again for everything Paul!"
2593263,37448795,2015-07-07,2893286,Oscar,A great stay once again at the Spring Street Center!  My team enjoyed the comfort of all four rooms and the super convenient location.  We'll be back next year!

2593263,38264781,2015-07-14,11105747,Erlindo,"I asked Paul if we can check in early or if we can leave our luggages at the front desk. To my surprise, the room is not only available but the air mattress was already inflated.

The house and room were clean. The rules were easy to follow and Paul was always available by text or phone call. 

Great service!"
2593263,39172385,2015-07-21,21848999,Ionel,"We had a great stay at Paul’s charming house. The house is clean, well well-maintained with everything you need, located at of about 5 minutes walk to the bus station, and not far away to downtown. Nice place to discover Seattle!"

since we were three group, he prepared an extra bed for us.Everything was clean and comfortable like a hotel. Also it's close to Downtown! 
We met the host Paul on the last day and he was really friendly! We're glad to talk to him!
I will definitely chose this place again when I visit Seattle in the future. Thank you!"

We do have a chance to talk to Paul, and he offers us very useful information. He is very responsive to the message and phone. The community is very quiet and beautiful. The location is very convenient I have to say, there are a lot of great restaurant nearby. My parents and I can enjoy a very good restaurant at Capitol Hill and after feeding our Hungry stomach, we just walking around and it is very easy to find many place of interests such as pike's place. We feel like the seafood in Seattle is the best. The oyster in the Taylor shellfish farms are the best!"
2593263,43817743,2015-08-22,39317456,Giorgio,Great experience. Great stay: a clean and quiet room. Easy access to the property and close to downtown. I will certainly stay again if in Seattle. 
2593263,44299645,2015-08-25,11672830,Michael,"One of my best airbnb experiences. There happened to be a wedding at the time of check in, but they are super nice and had me joining them! Nice house and rules are super clear. Met Paul once - interesting guy. You definitely want to know him and stay here for your trip. "

2593263,47059701,2015-09-15,20315605,Payam,"This is the second time I'm staying in this place, and it is as nice as described. All the information is clear and Paul communicates all you need to know to you very well. I will definitely go there again. "

Cette maison respire la sérénité, la quiétude, on s'y sent bien dès l'arrivée.
Paul nous a accueilli avec beaucoup de chaleur et de gentillesse, répondant très rapidement aux renseignements qu'on lui demandait"
2593263,48704497,2015-09-28,13153011,Erin & Sam,"While I never met Paul, I had an excellent experience at the Spring Street Center. Everything was clean, tidy, and as expected. My room was even bigger than expected and quite comfortable. And the location, near a large number of excellent restaurants, as well as Elliott Bay Books, was great. Thanks, Paul, for providing such peaceful, but centrally located accommodations. "
2593263,49044432,2015-09-30,25014340,Lee,"It was nice stay. Everything was organized, clean, warm, nice location. If I visit Seattle again I will stay here again! Highly recommend! "
2593263,49640997,2015-10-05,3856838,Rosie,"We had a lovely stay at Spring Street Center. We were able to come and go as we pleased with no difficulty at all, thank you to the detailed information and instructions provided by Paul beforehand. The accommodation was immaculately clean and spacious. Our room was exactly what we needed and was a peaceful place to come back to after a busy day in the city. We were within walking distance (5 mins) to the bustling and trendy Pike Street, which provided a vast array of cool shops and places to eat and drink. We like to walk everywhere and found that it was around a 30-minute walk to downtown (Pike Place Market, waterfront, etc.) and around 40 minutes walking to the EMP and the Space Needle. When we didn't fancy walking, we found Uber was a great alternative - it took under 10 minutes to get downtown that way and cost around $6-$7 each time - brilliant value! Overall, we found that Spring Street Center was great value for money and will definitely be back should we ever visit Seattle again. "
2593263,50020345,2015-10-08,43236146,Sunny,"Because of my late arrival, I didn't get a chance to meet Paul. However, we kept texting prior my arrival, and I felt so welcome. The place was really nice for a short stay. VERY CLEAN! Me and my family really enjoyed the short stay (2 nights) in Paul's lovely place. I highly recommend this place to everyone! "
2593263,50518857,2015-10-12,39085138,Jie,Great! Very well maintained apartment. Situated In a lovely neighborhood. Walking distance to major attractions. 
2593263,52100250,2015-10-26,41105487,Marti,"I stayed at this home for two nights in October.  The experience was very pleasant, the description was exactly what was provided, and I really enjoyed my time there! It was easy to get to, and the instructions were very clear.  I never got a chance to meet Paul, but I did meet other staff members and they were very helpful and friendly.  The place is in a great location, with easy access to Seattle University and great restaurants.  I would highly recommend it!  "
5958674,32603228,2015-05-19,333520,Ben,"Elaine and Andy are wonderful hosts. They have welcomed me very warmly and made sure that I felt right at home. We had really good conversations about culture and politics. Everything from entrance management, fresh fruit & drinks to well prepared rooms was super organised. They had great confidence, which led to wonderful hospitality.

West Seattle is beautiful because of it's liberal charme and secluded position - but yet so close to the city. The house is situated in a very quiet neighborhood. Nearby there are several opportunities for shopping and there are some good restaurants. You can take the bus C-Line to downtown Seattle (20 Minutes), or just  take the bus 50 to Alki Beach and from there by water taxi, which is a great experience.

Will return as soon as possible."
5958674,33744078,2015-05-31,23493729,Lonnie,Elaine was really great at communicating all the information I needed to have a great visit to Seattle.  
5958674,34497909,2015-06-08,34544813,Olivier,"The house is absolutely wonderful and very clean. It is very well situated since there are a few coffee shops, restaurants and pubs around the area. It is very easy to get downdown via the fast C line (bus), and there's a bus stop not far from the house. Elaine and her husband were awesome hosts. They were very kind and make us feel home. They even give us a good drink one night! They also gave us a few tips regarding the ""must see"" and ""nice to see"" things in Seattle.

I absolutely recommend a stay at their place.
Thanks again,
Olivier "

Overall a very pleasant experience."
5958674,35694129,2015-06-21,23470594,Kristin,"My husband and I had a great stay at Elaine's home while visiting Seattle for a wedding weekend- it's a brand new modern home and the room was a nice size and very comfortable. It's also a great location in Alki, in a calm and quiet neighborhood with plenty of free street parking and very walkable to shops and restaurants. Elaine also provided fresh fruit, juice and croissants each morning which was very thoughtful and generous. We had a really nice stay, thanks!"
5958674,36438717,2015-06-28,28047958,Mark,"Elaine and Andy were very kind and sociable. They provided a warm friendly welcome and were helpful in providing information for staying in the area.  They are also traveled and very physically active, so conversation with them was always captivating and interesting.  

The home was clean and fresh with newer building materials and remained rather cool and comfortable despite the summer heat in the area.  I would definitely recommend and consider staying here again.

5958674,44976765,2015-08-30,41168048,Chris,Elaine & Andy have definitely cracked the code on how to host strangers comfortably in their beautiful contemporary home. Private & public rooms were appropriate and impeccable; expectations of guests were clear and reasonable; Elaine was accessible & generous with time but also respected our privacy.

2695493,15769612,2014-07-15,3047377,Kate,"Bill and Barbara were perfects hosts. Check in was a breeze since they live right above. They took special care of our arrival and gave us breakfast materials, a nice touch. They were there in case we needed anything, and were a delight to talk to!

The apartment was incredibly clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable, always a concern for my tall husband. A washer and dryer is available and we use it once. We did not use the kitchen to cook dinner, but all the tools are there for you to do so.

There is no TV (which we knew) but internet is strong. There is a nice backyard but we were rarely in the apartment due to our schedule. One can walk to Columbia City, about a mile, but we usually drove. Convenient to light rail train station which takes you right into Seattle.

Thank you so much Bill And Barbara. We hope to return soon!"
2695493,18527809,2014-08-28,2101157,Signe,Barbara and Bill were fabulous hosts! We stayed with them for a month during a very transitional period moving from East coast to West coast and trying to buy a house with two little ones in tow. They were above and beyond accommodating and kid friendly. Their neighborhood was full of kids for mine to play with; they had a great back yard for running around. The apartment feels very comfortable and wa. Barbara has taken pains to make it feel welcoming. the space itself (though small) was very workable and has everything you need. Barbara thought of everything from a first aid kit under the sink to compostable kitchen bags and everything in between. The location was great too. Very walkable to grocery shopping and a bustling downtown center and great access to the link or buses for getting to downtown seattle. You won't be disappointed if you stay here. I highly recommend it!
2695493,18874826,2014-09-02,12795725,Hannah,"My husband and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend when we were in town for a wedding.  The neighborhood is residential and lovely and the downstairs apartment was perfect.  Really, perfect.  Barbara and Bill have furnished all the details that you have at home and miss when you travel (ironing board, mending kit, full kitchen, small jewelry tray in the bedroom).  We were so impressed with their attention to detail and how clean and comfortable it was.  There is a community orchard out back and we grazed happily on fresh plums and apples straight from the trees.  We look forward to future visits and we will certainly stay here again!"
2695493,19157762,2014-09-07,20315904,Lacie,"Our host were wonderful :) Barbara and Bill were more than acommadating. When we arrived we had step by step instructions on how to get in, and also a written list of all we needed to know. They are vey family friendly which was wonderful being that we brought our 4 month old baby with us. As for location, it was perfect. we were in a quiet neighborhood and only 
minutes from the big city. :)"
2695493,19552427,2014-09-14,15637552,India,"The place was impeccably clean, beautifully decorated, inviting, private, and quiet. Barbara was warm and welcoming and even took the time to research and print up a sightseeing list for us. I loved the garden and book exchange across the street and loved how close Seward Park (with striking views of Mt. Rainier) was to the house. Thank you! "
2695493,25707256,2015-01-24,23243380,Manuel,"We visited our children and grandchildren who lived two blocks away. Nice friendly neighborhood. Barbara & Bill were very helpful and accommodating.

2695493,26119726,2015-02-03,15431336,Emil,"I ended up at Urban Oasis after repairs following a water leak displaced me from my Seattle home for over a week.  Barbara went out of her way to be flexible and make the stay work for me. She was extraordinarily flexible, clear, and straightforward in all our dealings, for which I am deeply grateful. The place is a lovely, cozy little retreat and I've had everything I needed during my stay. The location is prime for Southend adventures, well situated close to good restaurants, the local grocery, Seward Park and Lake Washington. Highly recommended. I'll certainly come back to stay should I have need to. "

The accommodation looked exactly like the (website hidden) was exceptionally clean, the host warm and willing to be helpful and not intrusive. It was a well equipped apartment and we felt safe and comfortable.The location was perfect for our needs.  It is  within walking distance of coffee shop , excellent grocery store and restaurants.  We would have no problem returning. "

The apartment is spacious, meticulously clean, beautifully decorated, and very homey. Lots of thought went into the details to make this space as functional as possible, while still remaining tranquil and relaxing.

The neighborhood is ideal for travelers with and without a car. There's a cute neighborhood garden across the street, Little Free Libraries on the sidewalk nearby, and an organic grocery, coffee, and Italian restaurant just a few blocks away.

This was my mother's home away from home while she visited this week. We couldn't have been happier with this AirBNB - and we will definitely book again the next time she comes into town!"
2695493,29261939,2015-04-06,22171290,Michelle,"Barbara and Bill are awesome! We arrived late in the night and they stayed up to welcome us and even insisted on helping us unpack our car. On top of that, they left food for us to make breakfast and coffee the next morning. The apartment is smartly arranged and makes great use of the space. It is super functional and we had everything we needed for our 3 month stay. It is super cozy and we wished we could have stayed longer. It is within walking distance of a lot of cool shops and restaurants. If you have an opportunity to stay here, take it. You'll love it. "
2695493,35214401,2015-06-16,1552491,Elizabeth,We've stayed many places in this neighborhood near where our daughter lives and this was the best!  Barbara and Bill were very welcoming and the rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable.  We just hope it will be available the next time we come but we're guessing it's very popular.
2695493,35581538,2015-06-20,1499027,James,"Barbara & Bill were fantastic hosts as they were very responsive, accommodating and respectful. The unit was comfortable and very roomy - loaded with everything one would need. The bed was beyond comfortable and I actually slept better than I had in weeks. The unit is situated in my favorite Seattle neighborhood. Columbia City provides the best local vibe in the city with great one off shops and restaurants within walking distance. There are lots of transit options and the unit is in very close proximity to the city's best amenity - Lake Washington and Seward Park. If you have some time to spend in Seattle I highly recommend this listing."
2695493,35928962,2015-06-23,31399432,Alaina,"Barbara & Bill were wonderful hosts! Barbara was very quick in replying to all of my inquiries and emails. The pictures of the apartment are  very accurate; the apartment was VERY clean and perfect for the few days we stayed. The neighborhood is very quiet and just a quick drive from Seattle. Barbara left us a few notes on how to use the local transit options, as well as markets, stores, and fun activities available in the area.  She also left us fresh eggs, bagels, coffee, the perfect makings of a quick breakfast! I would absolutely recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle or the surrounding area, and I will be booking with Barbara when I return to Seattle. "

2695493,37547316,2015-07-08,4500867,Denise,"This place is wonderful.  Seattle was beastly hot while we were there and this apartment was cool and comfortable.  It is immaculate and the furnishings are attractive and comfortable.  We spent some time sitting under the large tree, having tea and reading--very relaxing!  The location was very good for us and there was always parking right in front of the house.  The kitchen was more than adequate. I can recommend this place very enthusiastically."
2695493,42889626,2015-08-16,37446850,Annette,"Barbara and Bill were wonderful hosts! We arrived at 3pm and Barbara came to welcome us and check us in. Their place stayed cool during the 70 degree weather. Plenty of parking right outside their house. Their location is a 20 minute drive to Pike's place/farmers market. They had printed some notes for us; naming their favorite neighborhood gems. This was such a personable detail we definitely appreciated! I would highly recommend this place to anyone, and would definitely book here again when I come back for another visit! "
2695493,48938900,2015-09-29,33210583,Nihar,Nice and comfortable place. Quiet surroundings. Could use a bigger TV. 
2695493,52681478,2015-11-01,11804786,Alyssa,"From the very start of my stay with Barbara and Bill, I felt immediately at home.  The location of the listing is described perfectly, a little urban oasis; close enough to walk to Colombia City for a movie, dinner or groceries, yet far enough away that you still feel like you have some peace and quiet.  Their property is situated across from the local community garden and in front of the local orchard & within walking distance to Seward Park (don't miss it!).  The space itself is clean, well decorated and stocked full of all the necessities; blow dryer, tea, mixing bowls, you name it!

Barbara and Bill are also great hosts.  They mind your space and still maintain availability, all the while being kind and friendly.  They are incredible!"

7870538,51164768,2015-10-18,43950046,Jerid,"Absolutely loved the place! It was very modern, and was large enough to host our group of friends for the weekend. The rooftop deck is beautiful and the view of Seattle was great! We'll definitely be contacting Valerie again if we need a place to host in Seattle."
7870538,55868299,2015-12-06,30749007,Ellen,The townhouse is so beautiful! The studio was my favorite room! Valerie is great with communication and gave me all the necessary information and resources I needed for the stay. She also left out little guides about Seattle for places to go and other suggestions. She's a great host!
7870538,56951018,2015-12-20,22265444,Jerry,"Valerie was awesome and so was her beautiful townhouse. It was very clean and modern, my party and I were very impressed. I would highly recommend staying here. The townhouse was in a great location with many restaurants,shops, and nightlife near by. "
215954,1600388,2012-07-01,2135526,Sekai,"The Fremont house is an amazing place to stay for a short or long time. It is ideally located right in the heart of Seattle, close to bus lines, great eateries and the lovely and lively Fremont community. Within minutes you can hop on a bus and be downtown. The neighborhood is safe, neighbors friendly. The house is very nice, decorated with incredible artwork and zen furnishings. The kitchen is fully stocked with every thing you woud need to create a simple to elaborate meals for guests. The beds are very comfortable and each room has a private full bathroom., and there is a half bath on the main level. You cannot go wrong with booking this space."
215954,13046754,2014-05-18,5623093,Matthew,"Thanks Graham! Had a great time in your superbly located house. Couldn't think of a better place; sandwiched between Wallington and Ballard. Love the view out the window and the clean, spacious room. Thanks for the coffee and the chats!"
215954,13104068,2014-05-19,15108980,Lindsay,"My husband and I spent our first night of our roadtrip at the Fremont place and it was the perfect place to start our adventure. The house was centrally located and easy to find. We loved the neighbourhood for its vintage shops, interesting cafes and restaurants, and we spent the next day and a half walking around by foot. (Definitely check out the Sunday market!) Check-in was easy to arrange and Graham was a friendly host who gave us recommendations for interesting photography destinations and his favourite local hubs. Our room was decorated with Graham's own stunning landscape photographs that inspired to pick up our cameras, and there were plenty of books on travel destinations (including some for Seattle). But above all, the place was a clean, quiet and comfortable retreat after a long day touring the city."
215954,13250125,2014-05-23,14594797,Jay,"Graham was very polite and welcoming. The house is at a great location and we were offered full use of the kitchen and common areas. The hills were killer for our mid-west legs, but it was a great city and the neighborhood offered a lot of options!"
215954,13478324,2014-05-28,1796011,Li,"The room itself is very nice and the location is awesome, very close to everything. Graham was very helpful. :) Overall, we had a great experience. Definitely recommended. "
215954,19236021,2014-09-08,2163180,Matt,"This place was great. Comfy bed, quiet, great location, and a full bathroom. It was also easy to access and felt completely safe.

The only thing I regret was not getting to meet Graham & Maria. Their communication was fantastic but my schedule never synced up with them, but the next time I'm in Seattle I'll probably be staying here again - so hopefully next time.

Highly recommended."
215954,19427514,2014-09-12,20267313,Gilbert,"Graham was great! First day we arrived he had a lot of useful information for us. He printed out maps for us and underlined restaurants, neighborhoods and other things in order to help us out with our apartment search.
The room was clean and we felt very comfortable and welcomed!"
215954,19802309,2014-09-18,2408877,Joe,"Perfect balance of hominess and privacy. You don't feel like you're at a hotel, but you also don't feel like you're up in someone else's private space. The rooms are very clean and freshly furnished and the house is in a great location. I only saw Graham once during my stay which was fine as I don't need a lot of hand-holding or awkward small talk, but he was responsive to requests and checked in once or twice via email. "
215954,20044430,2014-09-22,15211347,Ryan And Kelly,We had a great stay at Graham's Fremont apartment. The house is very comfortable and in a nice quiet street but only a few minutes walk to great restaurants/cafes etc. Graham was great and let us store our bikes in the entrance hall which saved a lot of worry. 
215954,20869049,2014-10-06,19806035,Xianming,Graham is a great person and I have a perfect time in his house.
215954,22117614,2014-10-30,1747345,Abigail,"I had a wonderful stay with Maria and Graham, Fremont is really a wonderful place to stay when you visit Seattle.  I didn't rent a car, but the bus to downtown was easy and I noticed loads of street parking (that doesn't require a resident permit!) I unfortunatley didn't get to meet Graham, but he was in touch the entire trip making sure I had everything I need.  Great place to stay at a great rate! "
215954,22319435,2014-11-03,271861,Wills,"Incredibly easy experience, great place, and amazing neighborhood!"
215954,39720171,2015-07-25,12224617,Janice,Great neighborhood; walking distance to restaurants.

215954,40671035,2015-08-01,31818565,Cameron,"Graham is a great host and a really friendly person. His place is fantastic!  Location is great with superb coffee and food options within a few blocks. 

His apartment is beautiful, peaceful, and very clean. I stayed for five days and thoroughly enjoyed my time in his Fremont apartment. The bedrooms are very private, including a full, private bath. 

Highly recommended and excellent value. "
215954,41698343,2015-08-08,7731429,Joey,"I had a great stay at Graham & Maria's townhouse. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood, cozy and thoughtfully furnished! Graham's a great host as well, who makes you feel very welcome in his home. :) "
215954,42778019,2015-08-15,11413271,Valerie,"Graham's townhouse is truly awesome! Surprisingly it is located just near the Green Lake and we did a great jogging in the morning after I arrived.  The neighbourhood is quite and makes me feel safe when I came back late alone.  There is a bus station two blocks away from the house, it can take you directly to the city centre.  I strongly recommend you stay with Graham and Maria when visiting Seattle, the room is cozy, makes you feel like home. "
215954,44497116,2015-08-26,26494910,Rebecca,"These guys were great! Graham was so hospitable, and made sure there was ample breakfast food available for guests. The house is very nice, and it's located in a great neighborhood within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and parks. The beds were comfy too! I would definitely stay here again. "
215954,45207928,2015-08-31,12547736,Craig,"This was a fantastic place in a fantastic neighborhood with lots to do and see. Graham was very welcoming and generous and the townhouse had everything you could possibly need. If you stay here you have to check out the local burger place, it's the best place to go if you need a burger.

I would love to stay here again if i ever pass through Seattle again! "
6335327,32423337,2015-05-17,33152158,Lisa,"The host made me feel very welcome.  He was very accommodating, and everything was clean and in order.  It was spacious, bright, and in a very nice neighborhood.  I would definitely stay there again if I were traveling to Seattle."
6335327,33178910,2015-05-25,25769776,Katie,"I had a great stay at Lc's place in Capitol Hill over Memorial Day weekend. I was somewhat wary of renting a private room in someone's apartment, particularly as a single woman traveling alone. But Lc made me feel comfortable right away. He had lots of good suggestions about what to do and where to eat - and every suggestion was dead on! My flight out of Seattle was after midnight and Lc allowed me to stay past check out so that I wouldn't have to carry my bags around all day.

The apartment was beautifully decorated and in a great neighborhood in Seattle with lots of restaurants and shops and views of Downtown. I would go back!"
6335327,34157196,2015-06-05,33757513,Anne,"My experience thus far has been great (I am staying at Lc's apt for another week). I was welcomed upon my arrival, and Lc was quick to both show me around the neighborhood and also provide tips for food, coffee, groceries, etc. nearby and around town. His apt is spacious, welcoming, and very clean. Capital Hill is a great neighborhood, and the perfect walking distance to my office here (South Lake Union). I would definitely stay here again on a return trip."
6335327,34801567,2015-06-12,33757513,Anne,"My second week at Lc's place was also great. The weather was hotter than usual for Seattle at this time of year, and Lc went out of his way (bought a fan, etc.) to make sure everything was still okay at the apt. He is a very accommodating host & helpful with navigating Seattle. Please see my prior review for additional information regarding this listing."
8086294,45453538,2015-09-02,40288435,Dustin,Absolutely fantastic stay. Joe and Heather were outstanding hosts that made me feel welcome in their home. 
8086294,46670634,2015-09-12,43527324,Aaron,"Serene describes the setting perfectly. I spent a very quiet, comfortable time in Joe and Heather's home while searching for a permanent residence. They were fantastic about providing their own personal insights into the various neighborhoods (I was unfamiliar with most of them). I always felt welcomed and well-accommodated."
8086294,48832201,2015-09-28,6280828,Susie,"Joe and Heather were excellent hosts, and I would recommend the room to anyone! They provided the comforts of home, and were very accommodating with my weekend schedule.  I really appreciated the thought they put in to welcoming me and providing great local information. And the coffee to go was a very sweet touch - thank you!"
7382368,49265985,2015-10-02,17867331,Zak,"Michael's place was a perfect home base for my trip to Seattle. The house was quiet and clean, the neighborhood was lovely, and everything was just as described. I especially loved being a 10 minute walk from some really excellent coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and a grocery store. Michael's wife and roommate gave me great hiking tips and really made me feel welcome. Would gladly return here the next time I'm in Seattle!"
1039766,5480716,2013-07-01,4549808,James,"Great host, very friendly, helpful and organized. The room is very private and the house is in a convenient location, close to many stores and a short walk from downtown. "
1039766,5802545,2013-07-16,2915366,Alfred,Lillian was able to accommodate my last minute booking for the same night and was very fast to respond to all messages. Her place was in a great location for visiting downtown and surrounding areas. Highly recommended!
1039766,5848798,2013-07-19,5068935,Angelo,"Lily was a great host; she was communicative and accommodating. She gave me complete privacy. The location of the apt could not be better, and with parking to boot! "

1039766,6561229,2013-08-17,3948903,Jeff,"This was exactly what I was looking for—a clean bed in a great location at an affordable price. Lillian is very sweet and accommodating, as well. "
1039766,6787494,2013-08-25,7659243,Shuheng,"Lilian is a nice host who is nice and accommodating.  The apartment flooring is a bit older than what the photo shows due to natural wear and tear.  The room is a bit small and so is the window.  The living is room is nice and big and Lillian usually has no problem with the guest using that room.  The AC is only in the living room and is not powerful enough to cool the guest room which can get kind of hot in the hottest days of the Seattle summer.
The point of biggest complaint is the smell from the cat's litter box.  The litter box is in the washroom but the smell permeates into the hallway and makes the using of the washroom & kitchen (besides the washroom) a very unpleasant experience."
1039766,6839976,2013-08-26,133037,Justin,Lily was great about communication and easy going about the whole thing. Thanks again!
1039766,7068755,2013-09-05,7466815,Matthew,"I had a great stay with Lillian, although I wasn't around the house much as I was in Seattle for the PAX 2013 gaming convention.

Lillian was friendly from the moment I entered the door (as was her cat!), and any issues were quickly resolved with text messages (as I said, I wasn't at the house much).

The house was nice and clean, I had the use of the kitchen if I wanted it (although I actually ended up eating out for all of my meals - Seattle has a lot of great places to eat!), and the wifi was fine for catching up on my internets in the evenings.

20 minute walking distance from downtown Seattle (specifically the convention center) was fine for me, I'm from the UK and thus used to walking around cities. It's also a lovely place to wander.

I would definitely consider staying at Lillian's again if I happen to be travelling to Seattle in future!"
1039766,7128558,2013-09-07,489513,Micah,"Lillian was a fantastic host.  She helped me find a restaurant late in the evening after I arrived.  I also enjoyed her cat that is very friendly.
I used her dryer to dry my clothes after I'd been walking in the Seattle rain."
1039766,7284670,2013-09-14,8522615,Anna,"I had a such a great time here! Lillian is super friendly and willing to give you directions or recommendations. The apartment is in a great location, lots of good restaurants ect., and you can easily walk to downtown Seattle. The room had a big closet and was very clean and the kitchen and washer/dyer were a huge plus. Also, Mushi the cat is adorable and super friendly. I would definitely recommend staying with Lillian! "
1039766,7444013,2013-09-20,398672,Jenny,Lillian is a total sweetheart and her sweet little house is located in the heart of one of Seattle's most vibrant neighborhoods. A real gem if you want to experience an authentic Emerald City trip!
1039766,7892565,2013-10-07,2001254,Michael,"I only stayed with Lily for two nights, but she was really welcoming and helpful. 

The house is in a great location on Capitol Hill which was my favourite part of Seattle, with lots of interesting places to drop into. 

Lily made the whole process really easy and helped me have a great visit. In fact she even put a load of my washing in the dryer for me on my last day which was lovely- thanks!!

A great home base to explore Seattle."

Parking right in front of the door was very nice as I decided while I was there to rent a car. Interesting neighborhood - lots of cafes, bars and restaurants. Very accessible by public transport as well. Would stay again! :-)"
1039766,10487782,2014-02-21,9899195,Tommy,Very convenient location to down town and heart of cap hill.  I was a bit of a ghost (in late out early) but place met my needs readily.
1039766,10524513,2014-02-23,12368547,Greg,"As my first airbnb experience, I made a last-minute reservation to stay at Lillian's for two nights in Feb 2014. She was the perfect hostess - responsive to enquiries, friendly but not intrusive, helpful and informative - and I had the run of her apartment including kitchen use and living room (which I really didn't have time to take advantage of). Room isn't huge but clean, warm, included wireless internet and was perfect for my short stay. All in all it was just what I expected/hoped for and the price was right. Her Capitol Hill location is perfect - great neighborhood and an easy fifteen-minute walk down to Central Seattle and the conference center which was the reason I was in town. I will certainly repeat next time I'm in Seattle."
1039766,10655414,2014-03-02,4401188,Jackie,"I was in town for a conference so I didn't spend much time at the house.  Lily was very communicative before and throughout my stay.  The accommodations were basic, but the place served my purpose well: safe place to crash, affordable, close to conference.  To anyone out there looking for a place to stay during a romp in Capitol Hill, this is an excellent location.  Thank you Lily!   "
1039766,10729911,2014-03-04,10314780,Terrence,"Lillian is very friendly and makes you feel right at home.  She also has some great suggestions for nearby breakfast areas!

The location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill with awesome restaurants nearby.  There is a bus service right to the downtown public markets at your fingertips.

Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore this area of Seattle.  Which in my opinion is one of the best!

Tanks Lillian and Mushi the Cat."

Also, the location can't be beat -- in a very hip neighborhood and within easy walking distance (though I do like to walk, so my sense of ""easy"" might be warped) to downtown and the waterfront. "
1039766,13566362,2014-05-31,5253169,Robert,"Our stay with Lillian was great! Her guest room is very clean. We were greeted with a friendly hello and some helpful tips about the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The location of the apartment is excellent, a close walk to many sites in Seattle. The bed is very comfy and she even provides complementary towels, a nice touch. As well, the kitchen is open to use which is very convenient. Thanks so much!"
1039766,13677143,2014-06-02,13098302,Mona,"Lillian was very warm and welcoming! She made me feel very comfortable in her cozy apartment! The room is exactly as decribed and there is also a large closet (not shown in the photos) with hangers, which I used to hang some wrinkle-prone clothes :) The only minor issue I had was the comfort of the bed, especially since I have bad hips. I mentioned this to Lillian at the end of my stay and she, without hesitation, mentioned that she would have gladly switched beds with me for my comfort, which was very kind. After leaving, she replaced the mattress with a new memory foam one, which I can't wait to try if I am every in Seattle again in the near future! :)

Location, location, location! Lillian's apartment is located near the southern part of Capitol Hill - gorgeous area. I was meeting up with friends around downtown Seattle everyday, and was able to easily walk there in less than 40minutes - even to the Space Needle. I really appreciated the ease of access and gorgeous scenery along the way. 

(Rating is due to the bed, which has been replaced now anyways!)

Thanks Lillian!"
1039766,14114687,2014-06-12,478768,Berangere,"Chambre très bien située dans Capitol Hill. Propre, bonne connexion wi-fi. Lillian est d'une gentillesse! très disponible. Very good location in Cap Hill. Clean, and good wi-fi connection. Lillian is so kind! she take care of her guests. Je recommande cet endroit!"
1039766,14200521,2014-06-14,16066084,Pamela,"Lillian's room was in a great area. Clear close by to places to dine. The place was quiet and neat - and Lillian was very kind. I was in a huge rush in and out - so didn't get to spend much time, and had to leave at 4:00am in the morning! So I left in a hurry at dark thirty! Didn't get to make the bed or wash my glass! Sorry Lillian!"
1039766,14514218,2014-06-21,7448809,Kirk,"I had a comfortable stay at Lillian's place. It is awesome to be so close to everything on Capitol Hill and downtown. I didn't see Lillian much because I was busy but she was very helpful. This was my second stay at her place and I would stay here again.
"
1039766,14657472,2014-06-23,16800309,Adeline,"This was a short but very nice stay on Capitol Hill for me. Lillian is so nice and everything is perfect in the house, near the bus stop and downtown. Thanks again !"
1039766,14789626,2014-06-26,15928423,Stewart,This is a great place if you're looking for a laid back neighborhood only minutes away from downtown Seattle. 
1039766,14847952,2014-06-27,8603279,Daniel,"Lillian's home is located two blocks from Broadway, where restaurants and coffee places abound. Her home is clean and she is a friendly hostess. "
1039766,15304248,2014-07-07,1165772,Evelyne,"Lillian est une excellente hôte! Elle peut prendre le temps de répondre à vos questions sur la ville et elle est sympathique et très discrète. La chambre est d'une belle grandeur pour un voyageur seul et très propre. Son appartement est parfaitement bien situé dans le quartier Capitoll Hill, près des rues commerciales mais assez loin pour y être tranquille. J'ai vraiment apprécié y rester durant mon voyage de 10 jours à Seattle.
--------
Lilian was an excellent host. She is open to answers questions about the city or chat with you if you want and she's very discreet too. The room is large and the appartement is kept very clean. Her apartment is perfectly located in the neighborhood Capitoll Hill, near commercial street but far enough to be quiet. I really enjoyed my stay there during my 10-days trip."
1039766,16197721,2014-07-23,1691865,Jim,"   The bedroom has enough room, a street front window with good ventilation and a fan, a good collection of brochures on the city, and a selection of books for evening reading.  The living room is spacious with a wide-screen television.  The kitchen and bathroom are adequate.  Security is very good.  The street is tree-lined, with jasmine in bloom while I was there.  The location is wonderful: a couple minutes from four different bus lines to various parts of the city, with two ending in the center of the Downtown after a bus ride of about ten minutes.  These lines also run west to Seattle Center with the Space Needle and other attractions, north past Volunteer Park with the Seattle Asian Arts Museum and its conservatory and to University of Washington campus, and south past the northern end of the International District-Chinatown.  A high-end supermarket is close, a four-minute walk; a cheaper Safeway is a couple of stops away on one of the bus lines.  Overall, a comfortable stay in a very fine location.

1039766,17209012,2014-08-09,4985124,Christian,"I had a great time with Lily. Communication with her before rival was great, she helped me find my way to the house. The room is as described, and I slept very well on the big bed. For warm nights there's a fan. I really enjoyed the time there. Lily is a great host, who gave me a bunch of tips and was always helpful. I regret I could not stay longer with her.
The location is perfect, you can't be in a better spot on capitol hill, walking distance to all the bars and restaurants.... I hope I can stay with her again when I come back!"
1039766,18236116,2014-08-24,6667219,Caitlin,"Honestly, I was disappointed. Lillian is a lovely person and I know that she truly tried to give me a good experience, but it was not at all what I was expecting. It is definitely a good value and a GREAT location, but the worst part (for me) was that the entire apartment smells really badly of cat/cat litter. I think the smell was probably the worst part for me to be honest. It also wasn't as clean as the picture makes it seem....just  heads up. 

For the price some of these things may be OK, and like I said Lillian is really very sweet. But just a heads up!"
1039766,18443510,2014-08-26,16765630,Jane,"Lillian is an excellent host--helpful and unobtrusive. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was marvelous. I'm a walker, so I was able get downtown easily on my own, but public transportation was also easy to access from the neighborhood.

1039766,20497933,2014-09-30,1024271,Alyce,"Lily's apartment was a great place to stay within a very short walk of Capitol Hill! I've mostly stayed in Airbnbs in Brooklyn previously, many of which were entire places that weren't lived in and basically felt like hotel rooms. This was obviously a bit of a different situation, as a spare room in a lived-in apartment, but that made it feel like a more authentic way to see what it would be like to live in Seattle. We only ran into Lily a couple times, but she was super nice and really communicative during our stay! Would definitely stay here again."
1039766,20743780,2014-10-05,1036548,Rafael,Lilly is quite friendly and respectful. Her place is nice and well located. I would recommend her

It's a very cool part of town with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The room is simple and not big on luxury. Don't expect a hotel-like stay, but if you are planning on spending most of your time exploring the city it's perfect."
1039766,21939402,2014-10-27,15525756,Suresh,"This was the first time I used Airbnb.

The room was exactly as described, the bed very comfortable. The location of her apartment is very convenient to Broadway/Capital Hill and seemed to be an easy walk to just about anything one could want. "

The room was comfortable and the apt. is very cute.  The location can absolutely not be beat!  Lillian was so considerate that when I asked if she had a small table lamp to read by, she went out and bought one!  I felt like a roommate instead of a guest, but I had tons of privacy.   Also, I never smelled the litter box!  The cat was adorable, and like my host, non-intrusive. Thanks, Lillian, for a great time!"

Although the space was small and the one bathroom shared it was available when I needed it.  Lily was respectful of my privacy while also friendly.
The apartment is an old building divided into 3 residences.  Her unit is up one flight of stairs.  The bed was comfortable and my room was superficially clean, though the whole unit is pretty run down and worn.  A friendly old cat lives here-those with allergies might want to know."

I even walked to the Space Needle one day! (It's about 1.5 miles - a good distance but worth it.)

I can't wait to visit Seattle again!  "

Lillian provided directions from the airport  to her place by public transportation, and was waiting to greet me when I arrived.  Her place is only one block from Broadway, which is the fun and lively heart of Capitol Hill.  There's a great used bookstore down the street.  It was only a 20 minute walk (downhill) into downtown and on the way you can meander past the Starbuck's Tasting Room and Serious Pie.  I'd be happy to stay here again.  "

The listing is as described, room is basic and location could not be any better. The room gets some street noise and with the lack of an AC, it may get a bit uncomfortable if it is too hot out there. Fortunately that does not really happen that often in Seattle. "

She is very helpful in getting you to her place and has loads of suggestions as to where to go. The room was comfortable and the mattress (memory foam!!!) was great to sleep in when paired with the clean sheets and cool Seattle air.

The neighborhood has a feel of a college town with older houses and plenty of bars and things to do everywhere. If you're going to primarily be walking or riding a bike beware of the hills.

Overall a great visit and very courteous and conscientious host. Would recommend for a stay."
1039766,41086718,2015-08-04,32873151,Adriana,Lillian was very sweet and helpful thanks for letting us stay in your home 
1039766,41927957,2015-08-10,27623504,Hector,"Lillian was a great host, she communicated with me from the start through the airbnb app and let me know of ways to get around the city. she greeted me and showed me around the house her home is a quaint little place. The room was great and very comfy. some street noise during the night but earplugs were provided so it wasn't an issue. the surrounding neighborhoods are lively with plenty of great places to eat at and shops around the area. She has a cat and with me having allergies it wasn't a problem at all. She made my first visit to Seattle wonderfull and go off without a hitch. Would recommend her and her home  to anyone thinking of taking a trip to Seattle. must try Americana brunch spot great breakfast meals."
1039766,42252953,2015-08-12,15537046,Mason,"Lily was awesome! She was communicative, and really made the point to introduce herself and make me feel welcome. There is no AC, BUT even in one of the hottest months, I didn't mind it at all (this is also coming from a spoiled California boy). She really made the point to be super accommodating about my cat allergy, checking in and making sure I was comfortable. I also spilt a protein shake all over my pants, and she was very nice to allow me to use her washer and dryer. I would recommend this place to someone else, because it is in a convenience location, and Lily was great! Thank you!"
1039766,42528133,2015-08-14,2519938,Lisa,"Lillian was a wonderful host and her apartment is located just a 15-ish minute walk (downhill) to the city center; it is also located a block away from a few bus routes that will do the same. Just in case you want to take the bus, Lillian has a rotating transit card that can be reloaded.

The room looks just as it does in the pictures; quaint with a closet, phone charger, and fan - which was very appreciated in the summer! "
1039766,42999713,2015-08-16,9311968,Galen,"Clean, quiet space for city adventuring. Adorable cat. Bed is slightly creaky with two people on it and so would recommend that sensitive sleeping couples (we're earplugs + face-mask people) be aware. Otherwise, super wonderful. "
1039766,43300551,2015-08-18,40450183,Dan,"Lily was super friendly, and the room was very tidy. Excellent neighborhood too!"
1039766,43718391,2015-08-21,41588549,Nate,"The spot was clean and quiet and the cat was pretty cool. I didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment since I was wandering around Seattle most of time, which was very easy given the apartment's great location."
1039766,44051794,2015-08-23,39960123,Mark,Welcoming and friendly. Experienced host with all consideration taken care of
1039766,44870935,2015-08-29,42599674,Kurt,comfy bed right in the heart of town. everything was great.
1039766,45206131,2015-08-31,467077,Kahlief,"Lillian was AWESOME, she's super down to Earth. Showed me where everything was, got me settled in and was an amazing host. Muushi was the best and sweetest cat too. I would definitely stay here again.  "
1039766,45644059,2015-09-04,8564120,Jon,Great location and Lillian was very helpful!  Place is more rustic and in an older part of neighborhood. Good location to shops and bars. 
1039766,46204244,2015-09-08,42340023,Andres,"Lilian is amazing. She made sure she disclosed everything about the house and the area. The house is pretty much centrally located so everything is either a walk or a bus ride away, which I loved. I wasn't home a lot since I was out exploring, but you definitely get what you pay for. Small quaint room, the bed was a bit squeaky, but other than that I loved it."
1039766,46812906,2015-09-13,43306936,Jay,"Lily was a great host.  She was well organized and we communicated well many times before I arrived.  She welcomed me at the door and showed me around her place.  Smooth check in and check out.  She was very warm and friendly.  She was able to answer all my questions about the local area and guide me appropriately.  Her listing is as stated, a nice room in her home.  Her place was clean and tidy.  The Capitol Hill neighbourhood is a great central place to stay.  It was only a 15 minute walk to downtown, and a very nice one at that.  It was very safe walking around at any time of the day or night.  She lives right near a great grocery store.  It certainly was great value for the cost, as the local hotels start at $300 per night!  It was a great experience (my first one with airbnb) to have stayed in Lily's home - including using her kitchen for making breakfast.  Thank you for helping me learn about Uber and sharing your coupon with me Lily!!"
1039766,48519055,2015-09-27,1336589,Molly,"This was a prefect location --two blocks from a close friend's apartment-- and Lillian provided everything I needed. We didn't see much of each other, since I spent the time with my friend, but I loved her friendly cat!"
1039766,49076708,2015-09-30,44310005,Travis,Lily is extremely kind and welcoming. The room is as advertised. Would recommend to anyone. 
1039766,49738570,2015-10-05,19530645,Hayley,Lillian was great and Capitol Hill is a really cool area.
1039766,50115457,2015-10-09,6296050,Kathleen,"Lillian is a polite, gracious host and her location is perfect! I loved walking the neighborhood and into downtown. It is walkable to a great Thai restaurant, smoothie shop, thrift stores and acupuncture clinic, as well as to Volunteer Park & the Asian Art Museum. A large grocery store and used bookstore is also nearby. I was very pleased and satisfied with my stay at Lillian's."
1039766,50599347,2015-10-12,31768301,Ines,"Lillian is a very nice girl,she always check me if I need help. Good location also. She has a cat. But if you mind the smell of the cat, you'd better think again before booking."
1039766,51103000,2015-10-17,25103165,Soohan,Was great. She was super helpful 
1039766,52451759,2015-10-29,32223796,Kat,"I had a great time staying in Seattle with Lillian. This location in Capitol Hill is super convenient to both UW main campus/ UW Medical Center, Harborview medical Center, and the Seattle Downtown area. It was perfect for me since I had to be in multiple locations for an interview and also wanted to visit Downtown/pike place market and whatnot while I was there. The room was as described with a comfortable bed and fast reliable internet. As an added bonus, Lillian has an Orca card available for guests to use, as well as a clothing steamer! I also appreciated that the house has good water pressure. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a convenient location while in Seattle. "
1039766,52949665,2015-11-02,41218263,Eric,"Lillian was quite accommodating, bed was comfortable and everything was clean. Great location!"
1039766,53411566,2015-11-08,26386209,Sean,Great location! Easy to access Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle from Lillian's place. Lillian was very easy to communicate with and was there for check-in right when she said she would be.
1039766,53582549,2015-11-09,7341683,Lisa,Lillian was very welcoming and accommodating. I was able to check in early and park my car just in time for my dance competition that morning. Comfy bed. I'm so grateful that she had a washer and dryer available! I am not the best packer and didn't pack enough clothes for the weekend so yay for laundry! Full kitchen and yummy French press coffee. Thank you for a great stay!
1039766,54343383,2015-11-18,14768841,Lucas,Lillian was a very gracious and accommodating host and her cat Mooshi was very sweet! 
1039766,54560823,2015-11-21,34524057,Corey,Great place to stay if you want to explore the city!
1039766,55052852,2015-11-27,3610551,Crystal,"Sweet host, great neighborhood. If you're looking for simple accommodations and a comfortable room in a great area, this is a great pick."
1039766,55492911,2015-12-01,41700834,Fabian,"The stay at Lillians place was nice and the location is very convenient, pretty close to downtown and a minute from a bus stop away. Lillian was also very helpful with answering questions about things to do in the city."
1039766,56935428,2015-12-20,33761923,Kristen,Lilly was great to stay with! Her place was super convenient to everything and she went out of her way to help me out! It made my move to Seattle so much better! Highly recommend.
2539881,13325550,2014-05-25,9893564,Jill,"We stayed a few nights at Alan's apartment in Ballard and it was lovely! Apartment was quaint and quiet, but close to everything, including the Chittenden Locks and the bus lines. 

Alan was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed. He even printed out a few restaurant suggestions and a museum recommendation for us. Ballard is a fun neighborhood with tons of great restaurants and shops nearby; we really enjoyed staying here! "
2539881,31911537,2015-05-11,20274464,Brenda,"Great location, nice neighborhood.  Across the street from the locks, walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Good restaurants in the area.  Alan had coffee beans, bagels and flowers waiting for us. "
2539881,52351949,2015-10-28,46186006,Michael,"Alan was a great host. He was very accommodating (we were driving into Seattle from Minneapolis and arrived at 1am to have his awaiting our arrival). He was short and sweet but made sure that we knew where things were in the house and ensured we knew how to get into the house. 

Alan also left many suggestions for local eateries and cafes in the area as well as leaving us a bowl of fruits and a fresh bag of coffee which was awesome! 

Overall, Alan was great and very helpful."
2539881,55189837,2015-11-29,4776088,Emily,Alan was fantastic! He was so accommodating of my shifting schedule. The apartment itself is beautiful and clean. The location is perfect!
6370313,44159543,2015-08-24,39099101,Daniel,"Description was accurate.  The apartment building was in an excellent location, and the unit was quite comfortable, with excellent views.  The building pool and common areas are quite nice as well.

The most inconvenient thing was parking - the unit does not come with a dedicated parking pass, and the apartment building had no parking passes to rent for the stay.  However, there is ample free street parking in the neighborhood at night (8pm-8am) and weekends, and during the day, there are neighborhood lots, although they are all quite expensive."
6370313,45312689,2015-09-01,36255595,Cornelia,"An absolutely amazing appartment with a fantastic view. The price is great for it, too. Always again!"
6370313,46980860,2015-09-14,36829573,Gina,"The apartment was nice and the listing description was accurate, however this apartment is rented by Global Serviced Apartments and is not a person-to-person rental. They were inflexible when it came to making reservation changes withing 24 hours of booking. Communication was impossible. Our confirmation was not consistent with the reservation we had agreed upon. As a result, we tried to contact Kara Smith and the company, but only ever reached a messaging center and we never received a response. Ultimately, we resolved the issue with the property manager on-site who was extremely responsive. In fact, I recommend contacting Metropolitan Towers directly for rentals, as they are very accommodating and more affordable. Finally, we were charged for five nights , even though we only stayed two, and though promised reimbursement, two weeks later, we still have not received it. As I mentioned above, the building was lovely but working with Global Serviced Apartments was far more challenging than I ever imagined and not the welcoming, personal Airbnb experience I am accustomed to or the experience I expected when planning a trip through Airbnb."
6370313,50462040,2015-10-12,6900152,Saleh,"I have very mix felling about my experience in this accommodation. 
After reaching Seattle after more then 24 Hours of flying and connection at the airport , I check-in to the reception of Metropolitan Tower at the concierge they have no idea about my reservation No key No information they have no idea about the name of the host Kara Smith and try to call her mobile number which I have before I travel and Like always answer machine and not able to leave a massage.
After 30 minutes of trying to figure any information ( the concierge people were extremely helpful) we find out the apartment was open (not locked) and the keys were inside. THE BIG SURPERISED the apartment was not ready (the linen in the bed and towels in the bathroom were all used and dirty and there was no clean one to used) and No one to contact NO Company to call NO host this KARA to answer and we (my wife and my son and myself) were extremely tired from the trip and the only solution was to find any place to sleep and by the help of the concierge lady we find two rooms in Hotel Max which is few steps from the building . Next morning we found out the whole company is off for some Jewish holiday and there be No cleaning because of the holiday and they will try to send the cleaning people by Wed. 16 Sept. so we have to stay another night in the Hotel ( it coast me more than $900 )
Finally by Wed Sept 16 at 3:00 p.m. we checked in the apartment. This is my bad start at this accommodation 
The good side was the location is super , the people working are very nice and helpful.
The only two good things that the company did trying to compensate me 1) get me the parking fob for the garage ( although the concierge people offer me a fob for the whole period (28 days) for only $200) .
2) They exchange the sofa bed   with new one after complaint about the old one 
This is my story I am not happy and I dont think I will use your service again.          "
8868833,52659132,2015-10-31,12001890,Zach,Michael was very quick to communicate.  He was super helpful and friendly.  Small details like the happy birthday sign he wrote for my husband in chalk were all nice touches!  Easy walking or uber to anything we could want or need.  House was clean. Nice fluffy towels.  Thank you!
8868833,53542844,2015-11-09,14064049,LeeAnn,"Michael & Karina were amazing hosts! They were quick to respond & incredibly helpful. Michael warned us about difficulty finding parking around Capitol Hill in the evening (a couple friends & I drove up from Portland). Instead of leaving us to fend for ourselves, he saved us a parking spot. Beyond that, he actually ended up parking my friend's car for her (she wasn't comfortable parallel parking).

The space itself is perfect—clean, with a full kitchen for cooking meals. The location is unbeatable; it's incredibly easy to walk to Broadway (one of the main roads), Pike/Pine & about a half hour walk to the water.

Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"

The neighborhood was just like is listed, you are in walking distance to everything! On those rainy days, taking an uber was a great, cheap option. I would stay here again, the place was perfect for what we needed, and wanted in a location. Great hosts, great location! "
8379081,47884284,2015-09-21,39970587,Takuma,"Yasmeen is a great host! She was nice and helpful all the time, and gave me a brief tour when I checked in and even offered me a ride to a grocery store nearby.
Also, the place is very affordable and is in a convenient location with an easy access to King Metro bus lines (48 and others) to DT and 5min walk to Green Lake, which is a great place to take a walk/go for a run."
8379081,48792328,2015-09-28,375160,Imran,"Yasmine's place is in a great neighborhood in Seattle with easy access to parks, cafes and restaurants. The unit has a private entrance and cozy. Jasmine and her son are wonderful people and would stay again! "
8379081,52713976,2015-11-01,33315992,RoseMarie,"I found communicating with the host to be frustrating.  Airbnb Resolution Center issued me a generous refund. 
Pros - meeting the host's son, access to shopping and parks, ample storage in bedroom, full size refrigerator, interaction with family dog and lighting in bathroom. "
8379081,55564832,2015-12-02,38728389,Matt,"Value! The place is essentially a private apartment, priced as a room in a house. While it is located in the basement, the privacy and accommodations were excellent.

The hostess was outstanding too. She was very communicative, informative and helpful before and throughout the stay.  The neighborhood is centrally located to access downtown Seattle and UW. Plus it is walking distance to bars, coffee, restaurants and grocery.

The dog upstairs is Hobbes. In one word, ""amazing."" He is very loving, intelligent and can turn a Pirouette if you ask him!"
8379081,57064716,2015-12-21,28832597,Emilio,"Yasmeen was so kind. Everything was so good. The room is pretty, and its amazing you are independient of the main house. It is also an excellent pet friendly site!!  The neighborhood is nice and well located,  pretty close to downtown, freeway, stores, university.
Thanks Yasmeen!"

The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed for our trip, including a seemingly endless supply of nespresso pods! The neighborhood is quiet and a very short walk from several great restaurants and cafes in Capitol Hill. I would easily stay here again! "

Matthews Beach was perfect for kids with a nice playground, sprawling fields, and a swimming area, and we could walk there from this place. The house is very clean, very tastefully decorated,  comfy beds, a nice shower, plenty of space, great hosts... Everything we could possibly need - even fresh flowers waiting for us in every room :-) I highly recommend this place!"

Jee and David are fantastic, friendly and helpful.  The beach is just around the corner which is a pleasant place to relax and unwind. We found the location convenient to everything.  We hope to rent this space again when traveling to Seattle next year! The last night we were in town we ate at this great restaurant down the road, Sand Point Grill. Delicious food,  yummy wine and superb service. Try the Cauliflower Steak and the Crab Risotto."

When we showed up -- delayed by a plane and tired -- the hosts helped us with our luggage into their beautiful house.  It was perfect for us -- one mile away from Magnuson Park and the U District; 15 min drive to Seattle without traffic.  The house was clean, elegant, and comfortable for myself, wife, and two kids. Would rent again."

The listing was accurate in all respects...a comfortable living room, kitchen, full bath, 2 bedrooms, and laundry facilities.  A short walk from Matthews Beach, Lake Washington, and the Burke-Gilman trail.  Our host, Jee Young Kim, was equally welcoming and helpful in responding to our questions.  We would readily stay here again.  In fact, if we had the opportunity to be in Seattle long-term, we'd think about renting the apartment."

Its great place for a family with younger kids. The park and trails are nearby and its only about 10-15 minute from I-5 and Whole Foods market. This was our first Airbnb experience and it will be hard to top. Thanks Jee and David!

The home is in a very nice residential neighborhood and the entire bottom floor is reserved for guests. Nice, large backyard and even though it was rainy while we were there (shocking I know) we grilled out and had an amazing time. Four adults and an 11 month old stayed here very comfortably. Every touristy question Jee was able to answer and we were even introduced to the excellence that is Metropolitan Market. Get some grillables and go nuts. 5 minute walk to Matthews Beach which has a lake view and a very nice playground. They provided a pack and play and some cooking essentials. "

3004007,41332094,2015-08-07,31892400,May,"Great Place for Family Time
I've stayed in several vacation rentals In Seattle, and this has been one of the best experiences. Why? Location was perfect for us, with easy access to the U.W., and other parts of North Seattle. It was a good location for avoiding the congestion of the Montlake Area and I-5. And close to Meadowbrook pool, for early morning lap swim. The furnishings and accoutrements were quality and well-thought out. Jee and David were the perfect hosts--responsive and so helpful. This is a good place to stay with kids, as it has a backyard (with a croquet set and barbecue) and walking distance to beach. Best time to stay here would be in the summer, as it's nice and cool. Winter might be a little dark, since there aren't many windows. Maybe putting up mirrors would lighten it up? But I'm sure it's cozy there in the winter with its fireplace. Will stay here again."

With so much to do in Seattle we were so busy from morning until night that we didn't really have time to visit with Jee and Dave as much as I would have liked. But our limited interactions were very nice. They were kind and helpful. Jee texted me to make sure all was comfortable and responded to my texts very promptly. The apartment itself was very comfortable. We had everything we needed. I highly recommend a stay at Matthews Beach Seattle.
3004007,45500871,2015-09-03,40727174,Steiner,Jee and David were available for messaging before the booking and were well prepared to host. Matthews Beach is a great location to be so close to! We had a neighborhood power outage and they brought over candles and pizza which was a very nice gesture. 
3004007,50004722,2015-10-08,12401106,Billy,Amazing house! Best experience in my airbnb history. Jee and David are very zeal to help my family. We had a wonderful visit in seattle
3004007,51761038,2015-10-24,40826015,Erica,Jee and Dave are fantastic.  When I initially contacted Jee she got back to me right away.  Upon arrival Jee and her husband Dave met with me and showed me around the apartment.  During my stay they were both really helpful with questions I had about directions and things to do in the city and got back to me right away.  I would definately go back and stay at Jee's home when I travel back to Seattle.  
3004007,53182767,2015-11-06,9926132,Todd & Carrie,"The space was very cute, clean, on the trail, close to the park, private, and met our needs very well.  Jee was a wonderful host.  We felt welcomed.  Communication was great.  It was a super Airbnb property and a perfect Airbnb experience.  "
3004007,54912797,2015-11-25,18832824,Peter,"We had a wonderful time! From the moment we walked in and were met with all the tasty and comfortable furnishings, to when we left and realized there were still Jee's sweet extras she had placed strategically around the house,ones we hadn't used, just because there were so many! To sum it up we had a cozy space of our own, hosted by kind and lovely people, in the perfect location for our needs. 
Loved it!

8891577,55288175,2015-11-29,49513367,Mike,The apartment was awesome and matched or exceeded the description. Jocelyn was great and responded quickly to questions even with it being a holiday. 
8848854,55008530,2015-11-27,46332694,Judy,The house is just as seen in the photos. It was cozy and comfortable.  We would recommend it.
6716620,34836174,2015-06-12,31863751,Mark,I had a great time glamping in the city! Perry was very accommodating and told me about some great local spots and transportation tips. It was very close to pikes place and only about 2 miles from 3 really good breweries within walking distance of each other.  I wish all my city experience's were this pleasant!
6716620,34927093,2015-06-13,27713736,Jeramy,This was a different experience from any other. Perry was very hospitable and has plans of upgrading the backyard glamping. It was fun and comfortable and I had everything I needed!
6716620,35050775,2015-06-14,35477024,David,"Perry pulled out all the stops to make sure that our urban camping experience was as fun and comfortable as possible. The tents were comfortably set up and we definitely felt at home. The rubber duckies in the hot tub, extra towels and complimentary breakfast were all nice additions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who, like myself, doesn't need a hotel bed to enjoy their trip."
6716620,35442541,2015-06-18,3285356,Peter,"I had a great time staying at Perry's. I was on a camping trip and opted to stay in my own tent, so I can't say much about the provided tents — from a brief look, they looked fine to me.

Perry was one of the kinder Airbnb hosts I've stayed with, providing fruit, drinks, and coffee during the two days I was there. We also spent about 30 minutes together talking, which I really enjoyed.

This is a place for casual Airbnber's. There's a dog in the yard, you go through an office to get to the bathroom, etc. None of these affected the quality of my stay (the dog was a bonus, actually), just letting you know what you're in for :)"
6716620,36441020,2015-06-28,35522801,Kyle,Perry was extremely accommodating to me while I stayed. It was easy for me to come and go as I please which I needed for this trip. I would stay again if i went back to Seattle.  
6716620,38059739,2015-07-12,13424394,Daniel,"Enjoyed my stay.
Perry was very hospitable. I arrived a little late, and everything was already set-up for me. The dog was very friendly. 

The house is on top of a steep hill, so bike-riders beware - you may have to push it up.

The air-mattress was very comfortable. I had to sleep with earplugs because of the frequent aircraft flying overhead. So, keep that in mind. Bring earplugs."
6716620,39846768,2015-07-26,25439806,Leigh,"FIrst time glamping so had no idea what to expect. Perry was super welcoming and showed us around when we arrived. Didn't really take advantage of the hot tub or drinks because it was cold and rainy and because there was another couple staying in the second tent so it felt a little awkward. Didn't try the outdoor shower since the other couple was sleeping right next to it and didn't want to disturb them. All in all a fun, unique experience though. "
6716620,40530705,2015-07-31,20818779,Leslie,"Perry is the most friendly host! His backyard is beautiful and close enough to walk anywhere you want in Seattle. We loved this space and would stay here again anytime! 

THANK YOU PERRY!!!!! "
6716620,41297152,2015-08-05,202477,Manfred Wuits + Anna Masoner,"everything was as described, the laid back atmosphere was great.

was fun  to stay in a tent but have all the amenities."
6716620,41497622,2015-08-07,2010312,Leah,"Perry's place was perfect for my one night in Seattle - it was close to restaurants and bars, and was the most affordable place I could find. The tent was very comfortable and I slept very well. Perry was very welcoming and I had a nice time chatting with him. I would definitely stay here again when I pass through Seattle. Walter the dog is a sweet old man and I loved hanging out with him!"
6716620,41550230,2015-08-07,33239147,Marco,Extremely friendly host. Very accommodating. Nice set up and neighborhood.
6716620,41707443,2015-08-08,3922631,Sean,"My buddy and I were spending a Friday night in Seattle and didn't want to dish out $300 for a hotel room downtown. Perry's place was perfect as it is a short light rail ride downtown. Perry was really friendly and helpful and pointed us in the right direction when it came to bars and restaurants. 

The tent and air mattress are what you'd expect - but you probably wouldn't be looking at this page if you had a problem with that. Perry makes an effort to make sure there is water, coffee, and beer and wine. He also put out some muffins in the morning. Our experience was made more memorable by staying here."
6716620,41909842,2015-08-09,13104116,Dane,"I had a great experience in Perry's backyard! It was easy to get to via light rail from the airport. Perry was a great host, fast with communication beforehand and very accommodating. Had beers out on ice, access to hot tub (didn't use it due to late arrival), and coffee and muffins in the morning. Nice cool night for glamping. 

Planes flying overhead were very loud, but I got used to it and slept fine. Just something to consider for light sleepers. 

Thanks Perry!"
6716620,44087878,2015-08-23,42218311,Trevor,Perry was quick to respond and very thorough in instruction on what to do. It was comfortable and a fun experience. Communication was great and his dog Walter is a joy. I'd definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle. 
84030,217699,2011-04-04,470985,Hayley & Stephen,"Marylin is a very nice lady and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment was very clean and tidy and in a GREAT location!  We took a 10month old baby with us and it was no problem for her (or the cat :-)
Thanks Marylin"
84030,273771,2011-05-21,568675,Melanie,"Miradina Al Lago is an ideal location directly across from a lovely lake and with-in walking distance to quaint eateries, coffee shops, etc.  The hostess provides not only a welcoming accommodation, but is herself warm, friendly and does her utmost to make you feel welcomed.  The suite was good size, clean and quiet.  The home, hostess and location all combined to make my stay a comfortable one."
84030,300475,2011-06-06,600234,Kreta,Quiet house in a great location.  Our host was very gracious and makes a great coffee cake!
84030,324038,2011-06-20,585536,Robert,"Our stay at Miradina Al Lago couldn't have been better.   Comfotable den, wonderful bed in a large bedroom and large modern private bath.  Restaurants and bus to Seattle within two blocks.  Across the street from a large lake, walking paths, etc.  Marilyn was a charming host.  Started each morning with coffee and pastry served by Marilyn.  Would absolutey stay again should I ever return to the Seattle area."
84030,337335,2011-06-27,317209,Cristy,"If you are just looking for a place to lay your head at night, this place will work! Marylin is a caring and thoughtful host who does her best to make your stay comfortable."
84030,355264,2011-07-05,748769,Joe,Our experience was great--Marilyn hosted us at the last minute.  Accommodations were spotless and comfortable.  Will stay here again!
84030,362943,2011-07-09,763739,Sandra,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle, especially if you have a car.  You couldn't find a more pleasant location, just outside the door is Green Lake, a park for walking or watching Seattlelites jogging. Restaurants and coffee joints right there, and a whole foods grocery. It's just a 10 min. drive to downtown, and you can park free here, maybe take the bus downtown to avoid paying parking down there.
The bed is comfortable.  A basement suite, very good value.  The hostess is friendly, gives you privacy, if you don't mind a friendly cat visit.  "
84030,387844,2011-07-21,815387,Jin,"Location was great, and Marilyn was a very considerate host."
84030,406624,2011-07-30,679290,Andre,"I spent a week at Marilyn and had a great stay. The place is clean and neat. It is centrally located with a 5-6 minute walk to the bus stop and a 15-20 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle. The area also have a very nice park and a few good places to eat.

I would definetely stay there next time I'm in Seattle. "
84030,426482,2011-08-07,842976,Daniel,Very nice house. Got whole bottom floor to ourselves. Cat was not a problem. Nice shops within 2 blocks. Busy street - so a bit hard to back out of driveway.
84030,441811,2011-08-13,884601,Sara,"We had such a great experience with Marilyn! She was an excellent, communicative hostess. A coworker and I stayed here for a short week-long course at UW, and it was the perfect location (not far from coffee and food, and an easy morning commute). We highly recommend Miradina Al Lago. :)"
84030,449989,2011-08-16,795707,Ed,"Neighborhood: excellent. Go visit the PCC deli and late afternoon take your picnic makings across the road from the Miridina to a lake side table. Watch the continuous procession of very-well behaved dogs taking their humans for a walk.

Miridina: excellent. Quiet, spacious. Perhaps a little too dark but considering we spent very little of the daytime inside, no great problem.

Leave your car there & walk a few blocks to Aurora Ave, take the #358 bus downtown to Pike Place Market or to see a Mariners' ballgame. Then a #5 bus back to Woodland Park Zoo. (Sunday feature for kids: ""Learn how to make paper from elephant poo"".)"
84030,466279,2011-08-22,379476,David,"Roomy rehabbed basement with separate entrance thru garage. No hassle check-in or check-out. Firm comfortable bed. Modern private bath,  with clean towels, linens, TV and guest internet. Location is good for those who want to be close to Phinney Ridge and Green Lake. Short drive to UW. The major disadvantages are inherent in the facts noted in first line of this review. It is clearly a basement, a bit on the dark side with low ceilings, and will not be confused with the honeymoon suite. If you have cat allergy, it will not suit you. However if you are looking for clean and reasonable spot for a visit to friends/family in Seattle, this is a solid choice. Nearby cafes and coffee shops as well as the Green Lake park. No fuss. No bother. "
84030,483353,2011-08-29,732245,Phyllis,Our stay at Miradina Al Lago was just what we needed....close to family and Green Lake!   Our host was gracious and made us feel very welcome in her home.  We are definitely looking forward to returning to Seattle and hope to be able to stay there again.
84030,526429,2011-09-12,866977,Alex,"Stayed here for the weekend while I was in town visiting friends and family (I recently moved away form Seattle). Marilyn's place was very clean and had great amenities, living room, in suite bathroom with shower. Had freedom to come and go at all hours which was great, and the location was very central to fun Seattle neighborhoods (Fremont, Ballard, U District, Wallingford, Eastlake)."
84030,538344,2011-09-17,57476,Jane & Earl,"Marilyn was very welcoming, helpful, and friendly, and the rooms are pleasant. The pull out couch is not very comfy (probably to be expected) but the mattress in the bedroom is very comfortable. The set up is perfect for a family but I wouldn't recommend it for 2 couples, for example, as it would be lacking in privacy and quiet if you didn't know each other well!
The house is located in a pretty neighborhood, directly across the street from a lovely lake with a great walking path. It's an easy walk to a coffee shop and a couple of restaurants, and it's right off of both Route 99 and I-5. A direct bus to downtown Seattle is only a few blocks away. 
Thanks Marilyn for the great stay!"
84030,544387,2011-09-19,57476,Jane & Earl,Added an extra night to our stay and Marilyn was accommodating and helpful.
84030,726485,2011-11-17,732245,Phyllis,Great visit.  Great hostess.  This was our second stay and recommend again to anyone that would enjoy the conveniences of the Green Lake area.  
84030,1240112,2012-05-07,2079047,Jennifer,Great experience staying at Miradina! Marilyn was warm and welcoming. The location is perfect with Green Lake right across the street. The room was clean and had a great amount of space. It was nice having your own entrance as well. Would definitely recommned this place.
84030,1465708,2012-06-12,2134124,Larry,"I had a nice stay in Marilyn's basement, and would stay there again.  I was gone most of the time and didn't make much use of the space, but the bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom was clean and nice.  I liked the private access so I could come and go freely."
84030,1525560,2012-06-20,2578428,Hans,"Room OK, a bit dark though (basement). Nice bathroom. Host helpful. Beautiful neighbourhood (lake, trees)."
84030,1568972,2012-06-26,2535536,David,my two kids and I had a very nice stay. 
84030,1830023,2012-07-29,2848660,Dena,Had a wonderful stay at Marilyn's place! Very private in the basement. The Green Lake area is very nice - went on a few walks along the lake across the street. Marilyn was very helpful when needed but also let us have our privacy. Her place was clean with LOTS of space to spread out. Would definitely recommend. Bus stop was a 5-minute walk away and maybe a 15-minute ride into the city.
84030,1919232,2012-08-07,782454,Shea,"Our stay at Miradina was great.  The house is beautiful, in a convenient location, and directly across the street from Greenlake.  Marilyn was easy-going and very welcoming.  We especially enjoyed visits from Shelby the cat. 

We would recommend staying here and we would stay again.  

Thanks Marilyn!"
84030,1966723,2012-08-13,2424321,Kathryn,"The outdoor garden in front of the house is beautiful. The location across the street from Greenlake is great. Everything was clean and well-maintained. The basement sitting room and bedroom are dark with only small windows. You share the sitting room with a cat, so it's not a good place for anyone with cat allergies. There is no kitchen or food service, so no breakfast. There are several places for coffee and pastries within easy walking distance."
84030,2048501,2012-08-20,3251545,Brad,"This was a lovely place to stay.  Very comfortable and location was ideal; able to walk to coffee, food and take a walk around Greenlake.  It also has wonderful accessibility to all areas of Seattle and north."
84030,5177323,2013-06-17,5742418,Darrell,"The location was great!.  The accommodations were adequate.  The bed was comfortable.  HOWEVER, the smell of cat pee was ever present and we think it came from the litter box behind a wall common with our shower Fortunately we were only in our room to shower and sleep, so it was not intolerable.  If the litter box were moved upstairs it would likely solve the problem and we've suggested that to the owner.

The access to the greenway and Green Lake was excellent.  The Lake and surroundings are beautiful.  I saw a Blue Heron perched in a tree adjacent to the lake early one morning.  My girlfriend ran the course around  the Lake and felt very safe.

If you don't mind the smell of cat urine this is a very good place to stay."
84030,5636158,2013-07-09,6137891,Timothy,"We stayed with Marilyn July 4-8 and had a wonderful time in Seattle.  The Greenlake area was beautiful and is a perfect location for commuting to all the excitement in downtown Seattle.

We were concerned about a previous review before we arrived but found nothing like what was described.  The room was clean and fresh and complete with comfortable bed, nice towels, great shower and fresh lilies.  Marilyn's cat, Shelby, was hardly ever around but when coaxed over for free attention, was extremely friendly and clean.  

Marilyn's hospitality was very inviting.  If your plans take you to Seattle, please let Marilyn accommodate you.  You won't be disappointed.

Patrons from L'ville, KY"
84030,5793196,2013-07-16,2717220,Jason,"We made a great decision to stay here.  The apartment is extremely well kept and very clean.  I was traveling with my 3 kids (ages 12 - 16) and we felt very safe and had plenty of room to relax and recharge for the next day's activities.  The location of the place is absolutely amazing.  It's minutes away from all of the neat neighborhoods of Seattle and from the University of WA, which is why we were visiting.  The lake across the street is beautiful and full of happy joggers, bike riders, dog walkers, and people enjoying life.  We even saw an eagle perched atop one of the giant trees.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to explore the city or any of the indescribably pretty hiking trails that this part of the country has to offer.  Marilyn was very helpful and communicative.  She was out of town for the majority of our stay but she called to make sure we were well taken care of.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.    "
84030,5923298,2013-07-22,7140222,Michelle,"We had a great stay. The neighborhood is awesome, Green Lake was an incredible place to explore. Walking distance to a variety of places to eat, which is a plus without a kitchen. Marilyn was friendly, and the space was private. Being in Seattle is nice, it was easy to get everywhere we wanted to go, since we were in the city. We had a car, but city transit seemed accessible. Four adults stayed here and we made it work, but it would probably be better suited to a couple with small children, since the pull-out couch was about what you'd expect from a pull-out couch (not super comfortable). The cat shares the space and woke us up one night, but we knew what we were getting into from the reviews. there were certainly no surprises, and we recommend staying at Miradina Al Lago. "
84030,6090211,2013-07-29,7517706,Tanya,"Highligthts - the apt is in a great location, across from greenlake and restaurants etc. The bed and pillow are very comfortable. 

Lowlights, at least for us - 
-the apt is dark
-the apt and esp the couch  smells like cat pee
-the owner lives upstairs, but the cat litter box and food is downstairs in the airbnb space. 
-entrance is through the garage. 

"
84030,6289311,2013-08-06,6894211,Perdie,"Had a lovely time staying at Miradina Al Lago.  The flat is in a beautiful location by the lake, and we quickly found an easy commute into downtown Seattle (around a 10 minute bus ride, with the stop being at the end of Marilyn's road).  The flat itself was spacious and well presented.  The private entrance was great as we were out late most nights and didn't have to worry about waking anyone up.  We met Marilyn and she was lovely, friendly and very accommodating.  We love cats, and Shelby was very welcoming - greeting us on the staircase on our arrival and keeping us company when we were watching TV.  Shelby does eat downstairs as well, but didn't make any noise or interference at all during our stay, and we thought it felt more homely having a cat around - if you aren't a cat lover the flat may not be for you."
84030,6614531,2013-08-19,4429501,Cathy,"Miranda Al Lago is such a delightful place to stay.  Marilyn provides an immaculate home away from home.  And, you absolutely cannot top the locations.
"
84030,6877231,2013-08-28,7936014,Fred,"Great location at Green Lake.  Very convenient for excellent breakfast places.  The apartment had a definite odor that we tried to clear by opening the windows.  Entrance is through the garage and in the basement.  Not a full apartment since it did not have a kitchen - not even a microwave.  Good if you are only sleeping there, but, if you plan to spend time in the apartment, you may be disappointed. Nice shower in bathroom and bed was comfortable. "
84030,7042964,2013-09-04,4810431,Karin,"I stayed in the bedroom.  No problems with the cat. I only saw her twice, in the main room.  No smells.  Fantastic location!  Everything I needed.  Within sight of lake, easy walk to food.  Love walking around Green Lake.  Two swimming beaches and boat rentals.  Basement, few windows, the only downside."
84030,11782337,2014-04-14,5270791,Robert,
84030,14305746,2014-06-16,4349976,Xinglu,mairilyn is very friendly. We had a wonderful time staying at her place. It is right in front of the lake and we enjoyed it a lot:D
84030,15115743,2014-07-02,467369,Sheau,"The location is just incredible!  It is really the best neighborhood in Seattle to stay in.  The lake is beautiful and really fun to walk around.  There are also nice restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance.  We especially love the PCC natural food store that is only two blocks away!  Our host is wonderful, very helpful and available for help if needed.  The basement is nicely remodeled, and very spacial.  "
84030,15776226,2014-07-15,15442164,Jonathan,"Marilyn was very kind and professional in our correspondence even though we didn't actually get to meet during our stay. My wife and I were in town for a wedding so we didn't spend much time at the house other than for sleep. As a Seattle native, I was drawn to the location, literally across the street from Green Lake, which in my opinion is the best all around neighborhood in Seattle. Its very central, beautiful and has many coffee shops, restaurants, bars and other attractions within walking distance. The downstairs was very clean and as advertised in the photos. The entrance is through the garage so we felt a little bad about returning late at night because of the noise but it didn't seem to bother Marilyn. There is still a slight cat odor in the unit even though there is no longer a cat. Its not overwhelming but it does persist. This was our first AirBnB experience and all in all, it was just what we needed at a very good value. "
84030,16259061,2014-07-24,16926442,Rachel,"We really enjoyed our stay here. 6 nights, very comfortable and spacious for me, my husband, and our 2 year old. My husband and I used the bedroom, and our son slept on the pull out couch. Marilyn was very quick to respond to any questions or needs, and went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed. The place was spotlessly clean! But we didn't even spending much time there because the location was great. There is a great bakery (Urban Bakery) less than a block away, where we went for coffee and scones every morning. In the evenings, we could grab an affordable dinner at the PCC market (just a couple of blocks away, an easy walk even with groceries) and enjoy our food across the street at the beautiful lake and park. If you have small kids, the park has a wading pool very close to this house- our son enjoyed it almost every evening with lots of other kids. Very close to several bus lines and we managed fine for the 4 days that we didn't have a car. The location was nice and quiet. We slept very well! We would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle!"
84030,16482415,2014-07-28,8696772,Irene,"Marilyn's place was comfortable and incredibly central!! Clean and simple. 
Being so close to the lake was amazing and my husband and I were very impressed with the local restaurants in the area. I'd definitely stay again. "
84030,16675117,2014-07-31,17761128,Bokman,Miradina is a wonderful person，this place is so wonderful
84030,17111212,2014-08-07,14355217,Martin,"MaL is a wonderful space in a very cool location, across the street from a park and swimmable lake, two blocks from a great [Whole Foods style] market. Walking distance to great many a great cafe' and watering hole, a total deal."
84030,17381398,2014-08-11,18611364,Cheryl,We really enjoyed staying here!  The place was very clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood near Greenlake was wonderful!  The place was right next to the lake.  The space was also very private which was nice.
84030,17694749,2014-08-16,17052302,Carrie,"MIRADINA AL LAGO and our host, Marilyn, made for the perfect stay in the perfect location outside of Downtown Seattle. We really appreciated that the accommodations were exactly or better than as described, both in amenities and the beautiful location right on Green Lake. It was wonderful having a separate entrance, because we were so busy - keeping crazy hours.  The space was tastefully decorated with very comfortable furnishings (except, just as Marilyn says, if there are more than two of you, don't draw the short stick and sleep on the hideabed unless you can crash on anything) and cushy towels.

 GREAT COFFEE and goodies at Bauhaus is within staggering distance in the a.m.; so are restaurants and of course the beautiful Green Lake where if you are the running, walking, biking, badminton, volleyball, picnic or just handholding-strolling type, you will have lots of happy company - seems very safe. Although we had a car (yes you can park right in the driveway), we easily used public transit to go many places, including Bainbridge Island. We had chosen Miradino al lago for its proximity to the Phinny Ridge area with my son's restaurant and apartment but it was close to so much more.

Miradino al lago made our stay convenient, comfortable and enjoyable.  Marilyn made it so easy and private for us that I was afraid that we would not have the opportunity to meet, but eventually we were successful and she is absolutely delightful. I am already trying to figure out when I can come back."
84030,18014415,2014-08-20,18057546,Marni,"Marilyn was very welcoming. The house was exactly how it was described; there was no smell at all. The house is right by the park, shops and food. It was a perfect location and would love to visit again. "
84030,18203109,2014-08-23,4496454,Jessica,"What a cozy room! We were welcomed by Marilyn when we arrived and immediately felt at home. Greenlake is a fantastic neighborhood, very lively and residential at the same time. Our stay could not have been better. "
84030,18811466,2014-09-01,4430978,Apurva,"We had a great time at Miradina Al Lago. We met Marilyn on the first night of our three night stay and she was very nice. The space is very private with a completely separate entrance, along with a living room, bedroom and bathroom. It was a perfect spot for a weekend in Seattle, and is exactly as described on the website. 

The Greenlake neighborhood is lovely. There are some nice restaurants and bars. We especially liked walking around the lake in the evening and getting coffee at Bauhaus in the mornings. "
84030,20031507,2014-09-22,10601127,Joseph,"Comfortable bed, private room, very clean, nice bathroom,  plenty of plush towels,  nice Green Lake location. Bus, market, cafes all nearby.  I would definitely stay here again. 

Reading some of the other reviews, I must remark  --  there is no odor!! In fact, for a basement, the air is remarkably good. You don't feel like you're in the basement, air-wise.   It's a little dark, though there are 3 small windows, so it doesn't feel like a bunker.  Plenty of lamps/ lighting.

It is spotlessly clean.

I didn't need the extra living room and the extra space.  But I could see this being perfect for a family, with the kid(s) on the pullout sofa in the living room.  

The privacy and private entry is great.  Beware, it's through the automatic garage door. At first, the noise of it feels like you are loudly announcing every entry and exit.  After a day or so I just got used to it and Marilyn assured me that she she rarely even notices.  I came and went at all hours. 



"
84030,23290271,2014-11-28,3262129,Sarah,Great proximity to the lake. Marilyn was really nice. Close to the cafes and restaurant. Nice getaway from the city.
84030,28966949,2015-04-01,25639503,Christine,"Marilyn's basement apt was sparse but adequate for our needs.  Very private, nice location near coffee shops and Green Lake. 
Marilyn was responsive to our requests while we were there. 

 "
84030,33306459,2015-05-26,33072232,Irle,"We had a great time staying at Marilyn's airbnb. There was lots of room for the two of us; large bedroom, private bathroom with lots of hot water for the shower, and living room. Marilyn was very welcoming and kept asking if there was anything we needed. For us it was the perfect location; 2 blocks from our son and across the street from Green Lake. I'd recommend this place to all of you."
84030,34581958,2015-06-09,13424438,Howard,"Marilyn is an outstanding host. I stayed at her suite for a week and found the accomodations immaculate, very comfortable, and the location excellent. Restaurants, cafes, organic grocery store, beautiful lake and park, all within walking distance."
84030,34946842,2015-06-14,5231055,Kenna Sue,It was a little odd going through the garage but I don't know if a better way to get to the downstairs.   It would have been nice to have a coffee maker but the location made up for both inconveniences.
84030,36887535,2015-07-02,5518758,Ran,"Marilyn is an excellent host. She is welcoming and accommodating, but also respects your privacy. I can't remember any conversation that didn't end with her saying ""Let me know if you need anything!"" Messages and texts were responded to promptly. We stayed for almost a week in unusually hot weather, so the coolness of the basement was a welcome comfort. I read some reviews that mentioned a cat scent, but there was no cat smell in the apartment.

I noticed that Marilyn has added a coffee machine, but we hardly ever used it, since there are so many cafes nearby. Seattle is a coffee town after all! There is also a 7/11 and a Dollar store nearby, for forgotten amenities. There is one parking spot available in Marilyn's driveway, but we had two cars in our group and we never had a problem finding street parking. The house is in a great location, close to two major roads, so driving to and fro was very convenient. The lake is right across the street, so it was very easy to take a late day stroll."
84030,38204711,2015-07-13,29861661,Clint,Great location!  Marilyn's suite was very comfortable and private.  And clean.  Very user friendly and affordable.  Thanks Marilyn.
84030,39830812,2015-07-26,37897626,Reese,"Very welcoming!  Great location!  A basement feeling about it, with low ceilings, but nicely furnished. "
84030,40213604,2015-07-29,17076034,Neal,"Marilyn was an excellent hostess. The apartment was spacious. It had  a washer and dryer, big TV,  fold out sofa/couch spacious bedroom, large bathroom, plenty of towels, etc. One feature I really liked was the entrance via garage door before you opened the apartment door.
Great location on West Green Lake. EZ access. We will stay there again."
84030,41790343,2015-08-09,36952615,John,"Marilyn was a fantastic host that provided a clean and comfortable place to stay while my son and I were visiting Seattle.  The description was accurate and the location was perfect.  The house is located directly across from Green Lake which was very relaxing, close to good restaurants and coffee shops and a short drive into downtown."
84030,44199634,2015-08-24,37087444,Harry,Nice place in a great location.  Easy access to come and go as you desire.  Looking for a fun way to spend time in Seattle?  Stay at Miradina Al Lago and experience Green Lake and adjoining neighborhoods...cant beat it.
3303978,16532889,2014-07-28,15022038,Kyle,"The accommodations were exceptional and Andrea was a delightful host! The listing was exactly as described in a very charming house on a quiet, residential Ballard street. I had no trouble finding street parking on the same block, even when arriving late on weekend nights.

Andrea attended to every little detail prior to my check-in and stayed in constant communication with me throughout my stay, even when our schedules did not align to speak in person. She was flexible with my arrival time and greeted me at the door when I made it to Seattle (I loved meeting her charming and super-friendly dog, too!).

Her apartment was fully stocked and quite comfortable. The kitchen had a variety of teas and coffee (perfect for early mornings!) and the WiFi was fast and reliable. It was quite warm during my stay, but the apartment stayed comfortably cool with a great cross-breeze from the windows.

This was my first airbnb experience and Andrea definitely set the bar quite high! I would recommend her listing without hesitation to anyone looking for more authentic and charming accommodations in the Seattle area."
3303978,17017852,2014-08-05,1643458,Ivan,"We liked our stay at Andrea's place very much. Apartment is very cozy, charmy, convenient and extremely clean. Its also not small, pretty spacious. Very comfortable big firm bed in the bedroom and Adrea also provided for us an extra foam bedding to sleep on the lining room's floor which was comfy as well. House itself is all surrounded with trees and flowers like a countryside escape, but it is just 5 mins walk from all the infrastructure of Ballard: huge grocery, gym, tones of restaurants, cafes, bus lines, etc. Thanks a lot to Andrea for our nice stay! "
3303978,17305799,2014-08-10,548426,Kalina,Andrea's place was great and just what we needed for our short stay. Communication with her was seamless and we had no trouble with finding the place or any other logistics. 
3303978,17640629,2014-08-15,3171909,Laetitia & John,"What a great experience ! Andrea is a perfect host, friendly, with good tips to discover Ballard, and her place is a cozy gem in a beautiful and peaceful neighbourhood, close by walk to different bars and coffees and the bus stop for downtown. Our fisrt stay in Seattle was such a great moment, and we'll definetly come back at Andrea's place. Five stars recommandations !!!!"
3303978,17958854,2014-08-19,18066858,Sarah Anne,"Andrea's apartment was fantastic! It was clean, quiet and beautifully decorated. Andrea provided thoughtful amenities, including bagels and cream cheese for our first morning and a wide selection of tea. The location was ideal, located in a trendy neighbourhood and very close to transit making exploration of the city convenient. Andrea was a wonderful host! Although we didn't interact much, she was always one text message or knock on the door away :) "
3303978,18580396,2014-08-28,5109645,Joseph,"Andrea's place is such a lovely,and  extremely clean place.
The flat is in à good location, close to gardens and an interesting night Life."
3303978,18812408,2014-09-01,5230623,Summer,"Andrea's place was impeccably clean and quiet. The house is within walking distance of so many cute little restaurants and bars, and right on the edge of everything great about Seattle without being in the hectic downtown/touristy areas. 

Andrea made sure we got in safe, provided us with plenty of coffee, and bagels for our first morning. Then let us be to enjoy our weekend. I would highly recommend this place and will gladly stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. 

Advice for future travelers; you are staying directly above Andrea, on the upper floor of her home. We had complete privacy and autonomy, and we are the kind of travelers who enjoy peace and quiet; but I think if you are looking to party, you should stay elsewhere, this is a peaceful place. "
3303978,19469763,2014-09-13,8961336,Peter,"The apartment was perfect!  Great neighborhood, safe and central to lots of restaurants and activities in Ballard.  Andrea was the perfect host.  And her dog was pretty cute too.  We'll definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle.  Highest recommendation."
3303978,19778157,2014-09-18,567540,S Brian,"Andrea's upstairs apartment is well-located and stocked with all the amenities a traveler needs. It's a short walk from the central commercial district and the waterfront, but the apartment has a rustic charm that gave us the sense that we were in a more bucolic setting. Andrea was a gracious host, and was accommodating of our itinerary. Highly recommended!"
3303978,20236097,2014-09-26,7199362,Christina,"My hostess provided information about public transport. This easily guided me to the bnb from the airport. She was there to greet me, show me around the apartment and provide some information/orientation to the neighborhood. The apartment was perfect! Cozy...impeccably clean and well appointed. I loved it!"
3303978,22145671,2014-10-31,131977,Marcus,"Our month's stay at Andrea's place was truly a blessing! We enjoyed the warm, artsy decor of her duplex apartment. Andrea was such a welcoming & gracious host, and yet still respectful of our privacy. Quite a refreshing ""home away from home"" experience. Plus, her place is located just a few blocks away from downtown Ballard with a wonderful variety of restaurants, shops & boutiques, cafés, a movie theatre, and grocery markets. We would definitely recommend Andrea's place to anyone visiting Seattle or anyone seeking an all-around, great sublet!!"
3303978,23123403,2014-11-23,21744174,Victoria,"This was my first visit to Seattle and Andrea's spot is in a perfect location! It is only a short walk to the Ballard district which is bustling with fun bars, breweries, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. There is also a bus stop just around the corner to downtown Seattle. My main priority is cleanliness and Andrea's place is exceptional! She is also a perfect hostess leaving hand-detailed maps and a book of menus with personal notes about them. On top of all this, Andrea is very quick to respond to any questions or requests. I would definitely recommend this spot!
"
3303978,23308028,2014-11-28,4516237,Daniel,"Nice apartment. It was very cozy, and a great location. Would totally stay there again."
3303978,23464218,2014-12-01,23788151,Adam & Ljubica,"Andrea is an excellent host! Not only is the apartment as lovely as pictured, she also went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. She had a booklet of breakfast places within walking distance, and a printed map of the neighborhood (Ballard) we were staying in. She also provided teas, which we enjoyed tremendously and even gave us a heads up about a local farmers market (which we had mentioned previously we were interested in). Everything was super clean (I did pilates so I know that her carpet was freshly vacuumed) and nice. The neighborhood was really great too, we loved walking around it, and it was close to downtown and other cool little neighborhoods like Freemont. Basically stay here you guys, the apt is great, and so is Andrea!"
3303978,23618437,2014-12-06,12365734,Ali,"We loved our recent stay at Andrea's place in Seattle! Thanks, Andrea, for being so welcoming and accommodating. The house is in such a great location - quiet enough to get work done and a good night's sleep, but only a few minutes walk away from great coffee, food, shops, and all the other fun things in Ballard. Visiting in December, I was so grateful for how cozy and warm the apartment was, as well as how spacious it felt, since I needed to get some work done during the day. I especially loved the living room with the big window, comfy couch, huge soft blanket, and the artful touches and pictures. We'd love to come back!"
3303978,24055251,2014-12-18,24052107,Dael,"This was a clean, quiet, enjoyable place to stay very close to whatever amenities you could ask for: restaurants, grocery stores, interesting sites, public transportation. I slept very well here, the neighborhood and host are very quiet and the bed is comfortable."
3303978,24472359,2014-12-29,3417855,Sarah,"Andrea was very easy to communicate with and accommodating. Her place was cozy and comfortable- a great size for one person or a couple. My mother stayed here for a week and a half and thought it was perfect. ""Downtown"" Ballard is in easy walking distance and the cafes of 24th ave are just a stones throw away. "
3303978,25956242,2015-01-31,9307214,Jesse,"Awesome neighborhood, awesome place, awesome host.  Totally perfect!"
3303978,26293997,2015-02-09,21101030,Linda,"This was a great place for us to escape to while visiting our son and granddaughter in Ballard. The apartment was warm, cosy and well equipped. We had everything we needed to cook a meal after our days of babyminding and the local supermarket is very close by. There are also plenty of great coffee places and a range of other places to eat. The local cinema is also good.
Andrea was easy to communicate with and we hope that the apartment is free when we come again later in the year. "
3303978,31926710,2015-05-11,31543838,Cara,Andrea's place was perfect for us and just as advertised. Awesome location from which to explore Seattle if you've never been or just to hang out in Ballard. Would definitely recommend to others. 
3303978,32373777,2015-05-17,29071224,Tom,"Andrea is a wonderfully capable and welcoming host.  We were impressed by the effort she expended to make certain that we were comfortable and fully informed as to the details of staying in her apartment.  She made it very clear that we were welcome to call upon her with any questions or needs that might arise during the course of our stay.

The apartment itself is quite comfortable and nicely equipped with all of the essentials, excluding a TV, which was fine by us.  Very conveniently located in Ballard, close to a metro stop that makes getting around in Seattle easy and inexpensive.  Highly rated!"
3303978,33276861,2015-05-26,13775936,Scott,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Ballard. Andrea was quite accommodating and easy to get a hold of. She made sure we had everything we needed and was quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops were just a short walk away and downtown Seattle was only a 15 minute drive. 
Andrea's will definitely be our first choice when we return to Seattle!"
3303978,33526525,2015-05-29,937921,Emily,great spot in Ballard! Has all the things you might need and the best location! 
3303978,34138263,2015-06-05,31308051,Barbara,Andrea personally greeted us and was very warm and friendly. She had many excellent recommendations for the area that we took full advantage of. She was prompt with all communications and we loved her cozy apartment. It was obvious that she took great care to ensure a pleasant stay for her guests. The Ballard location was fantastic and the immediate neighborhood was charming.
3303978,35253152,2015-06-16,5213167,Jesus,Andrea's place in Ballard was great. The apartment is very well equipped and super cute. The location is great. Andrea was always very helpful and accommodating.  I would recommend staying with Andrea.

3303978,36011696,2015-06-24,19567524,Klaus,"Wir haben uns bei Andrea sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Wohnung befindet sich in einem kleinen Haus. Das komplette Dachgeschoss ist sehr nett und einladend eingerichtet. In der Küche fanden wir alles was für einen mehrtägigen Aufenthalt notwendig war. Geschäfte sind fußläufig zu erreichen. Die Haltestelle Downtown erreicht man in 5 Gehminuten, Downtown mit dem Bus in ca 30 Minuten.
Andrea ist eine nette, freundliche Gastgeberin, sodass wir spontan um eine Nacht verlängert haben.
Danke für einen netten Aufenthalt in Seattle !"
3303978,36503186,2015-06-29,17149974,E,"Andrea was a great host! Friendly and helpful. The apartment is very close to the bus and an easy ride to down town. The apartment is very clean and spacious. Ballard, the neighborhood the apt is in, has lots of cool coffee shops and restaurants. Also Andrea had excellent communication with us both before the trip and when we arrived. We would recommend this apt to anyone staying in Ballard!"
3303978,41188102,2015-08-05,2287600,Valerie,"Andrea was a terrific host, friendly and very knowlwdgable about the neighborhood.  Her place is very comfortable and had everything we needed for a monthlong stay.

3303978,42345988,2015-08-12,2519187,Barbara,Andrea made us feel very welcome.she made sure that we were comfortably settled in and asked to ask for anything that we needed.We would recommend Andrea's place3 for any visit to Seattle in the interesting locale of Ballard.
3303978,45140197,2015-08-31,2930852,Andrew,"Excellent stay. The space was super cute and so many conveniences were already stocked, a fan, power strip, tea. Instructions were clear and easy to understand.  Clean  and great amount of space. Hope to stay again. Host was friendly and key exchange was quick and convenient. Also Spork is awesome!!"
3303978,45834965,2015-09-06,10237694,Stephen,"The apartment was cozy, well-appointed, and fully stocked. The location was very convenient for access to good food, good coffee, and several bus lines. "
3303978,46802540,2015-09-13,43181481,Corey,Andrea had everything we could possibly want and more waiting for us. The apartment was cute and cozy and we felt welcome the minute we walked in. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Seattle.
3303978,49481370,2015-10-04,42243217,Jason,Andrea was a great hostess!!!! Her place was very cozy and clean. It is in a great area and walking distance from tons of entertainment and restaurants. We will definitely look for this residence again when we come back to visit.
3303978,51147488,2015-10-18,16885781,Cyndy,Andrea met me at the door to provide a key and explain everything I needed to know. After that I came and went without running into her again but had the offer to contact her if I needed anything. The apartment was very spacious and had everything I needed. It is in terrific location with downtown Ballard just a few blocks away. Was easy to find parking and get to other areas of downtown Seattle.
3303978,51938121,2015-10-25,45042204,Lynn,"Loved my visit in Seattle!  Very clean and comfortable Airbnb.   Quiet and cute neighborhood.  Travelling alone I was unsure about walking around by myself.  I felt very comfortable as I walked the 5 minute walk to downtown Ballard a number of times.  I am not a big city person so staying a bit north of Seattle in  the small town of Ballard. was perfect. 
I did not have the pleasure of meeting Andrea but we connected a couple of times by text/email.   She was a wonderful host in many ways!   Thank you Andrea for making my stay in ""Seattle"" so nice."
3303978,53680386,2015-11-11,9361430,Antti,"Spacious, clean and very cozy. We felt right at home. Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood filled with cafes, bars and restaurants. It's safe and quiet. We loved the local movie theatre too. Also, a supermarket, a gym and the bus stops are really close by. Additionally, the kitchen was well equipped. Andrea was super nice and helpful. We will definitely return sometime!"

6228474,35675583,2015-06-21,2884743,Michelle,"From the very first contact to the day of our departure, I will say that this experience has been phenomenal. Absolutely everything exceeded our expectations. The condo was very modern and spacious. The bedroom was large and the bed was super comfy. the televisions were great. The bathroom was fantastic! The kitchen was perfect and the view of Puget Sound was stunning. The condo is located in Belltown and if you want to experience down town Seattle, this is in a great location. We rented bicycles and had them delivered and picked up. Very convenient way to get around in a big city. Takes a lot of the hassle of parking and the fees associated with renting a car out of the traveling experience. I would highly recommend renting bikes if you are going to stay in town. There is a great Pizza place right next door to this condo and a bunch of very fun bars and night clubs on the same block. In my opinion, the owner of this unit which I had the pleasure of meeting on the second to last day of our trip, did an excellent job of decorating and furnishing this condo. It truly shows that they care about the people that rent it from them and that they are not just cashing a check when people use it. As a consumer and customer, this makes me feel like I got a great deal and that makes me feel good!

Thank you so much for everything, really!

6228474,40961895,2015-08-03,9819206,Mark,"We had a nice time in this apartment – it is very comfortable, well-decorated, and even included small amenities like shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, which was nice. It is centrally located within Belltown, walking distance to downtown Seattle and with easy access by transit or otherwise to other parts of town. I should note that with this listing you are getting less of that true Airbnb experience and more of a ""hotel-like"" stay. The check-in process and overall accommodation confirms this. In fact, many units in this building are used likely exclusively for short-stay listings (Airbnb or otherwise). Also, the hosts run their own short-stay company and they co-list on Airbnb – they'll even direct you to their own application and website for parts of the check-in process. And I would advice checking their own site for lower rates on the same unit."
6228474,51925080,2015-10-25,5017954,Erick,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the photos shown in the listing were exact representations of the place itself.  The place is clean, tidy, and extremely welcoming.  From the initial conversation with the host (answering my many questions) to making sure I was prepared for check-in.  The apartment itself had all the amenities of home, including fantastic tips on local areas (some popular, some lesser known).  Location is fantastic, within walking distance to major Seattle attractions and fantastic restaurants/bars are steps away from the front door.  

Best of all, this place is just...complete.  What do I mean?  Many other airbnb listings seem to throw together features to form one complete place, quite reminiscent of my bachelor days.  This place is so well put together that I'm now re-evaluating the choices I've made in my own home!

I'll definitely be staying here when I visit Seattle again.  Thanks Darik and to all the team members that were a part of my stay."
6748502,39103615,2015-07-20,38091686,Jesse,"Great home, great view, great neighborhood and most of all, great host!

Ian is happy to answer all questions prior to my arrival (please give him at least 1-2 days to respond).  He is super-accommodating with towels, soaps, and linens; he and his girlfriend will even check your space while you're away (just like hotel service; if you prefer more privacy, though, just ask) to restock toilet paper and so forth.  They're constantly working to improve the space (a real mattress instead of an airbed), which is already far better than I'd imagine it would be.  And they're CLEAN ... even though they have a dog (awesome pet) on premises and I'm very sensitive to pet dander, I experienced zero issues during my entire stay.  Very thoughtful host.

Remember: Please be respectful of the house and the hosts and their rules (Ian didn't have many, though, since he's very easygoing), as always, and you'll have no problems here!

LOCATION:  Awesome!  It's between Sea-Tac airport and downtown Seattle, so you won't have to go as far as other places to find it.  And if you're renting a car and plan to explore other parts of Washington (such as the Cascades or Mount Rainier) besides the city of Seattle, this West Seattle neighborhood is ideal!  Plenty of free parking on the street, access to stores and late night places (most of Seattle closes down early, I've learned), cheaper gas stations ... you won't ever feel gouged compared to if you're staying near downtown.  That said, I can be over the bridge and at Seattle Center, Pike Place, Chinatown or any of the other major tourist spots within 10-15 minutes (at least, outside of the work rush hour).  Parking downtown may take you a little more time, but that has nothing to do with this location.

Many thanks to Ian and his household for making my first AirBnB experience in Seattle an top-notch one!"
6748502,39345444,2015-07-22,30558459,Sabrina,"Ian and his wife have a beautiful home in a great location. The floor even in 98 degree heat was nice and cool. You have your own entrance to come and go. It is close to everything you could possibly need in West Seattle, yet on a nice quiet street. I would definitely stay here again. "
6748502,40368042,2015-07-30,38243920,Julie,"Ian's home is beautiful, with great views. It's within walking distance of the bus stop and 7-11, which was very convenient, since I chose not to rent a car while in Seattle. 
I loved the fact that I had my own entrance to the house. The bed is very comfortable, and there was some space and hangers in the closet for me to hang some clothes, as well as space in the cabinets. 
There is no TV or clock radio in the bedroom, which makes it very quiet and peaceful.  The half bathroom downstairs was clean and well stocked with towels, soap and T. P. 
    I did feel a little weird going upstairs into the bathroom to take a shower, but once the shower is completed downstairs that won't be an issue. 
Ian was very accommodating with the check in process, allowing my sister to pick up my key prior to my arrival. Very nice! 
This was the perfect place for me to stay, very comfortable and reasonably priced. I highly recommend staying here. 
"
6748502,52676479,2015-11-01,38294482,Mmaafiong,"Ian was very welcoming and accommodating. Being new to the city, he invited me to a few get togethers and events which I really appreciated. The house is gorgeous and on a hill so the deck has an amazing view of the city. The garden area with the pond is a very peaceful and relaxing area.  The space downstairs is a basement so it doesn't have much natural light and it does get cold (which was great during the hot days I was there for),  however it is quite a large space. "
6748502,55393134,2015-12-01,46249966,Lauren,"This was my first time using Air b and b and it could not have been better! I just moved 2,000 miles and needed a place to stay for about a month while I got settled. Ian made my transition to Seattle extremely easy and calmed several of my fears. Ian is extremely welcoming and is focused on making you feel as 'at home' as possible. On top of making me feel welcome in his home, he was always giving me excellent ideas for places to eat, take my dog or grab a beer. At the end of the month it was difficult to leave such an ideal situation!"
4940491,29800560,2015-04-12,8451,Mike,"Our time at Liz's place was brief but comfy.  We met our host to pick up keys and chatted for a bit about our lives.  Her place is small but well laid out with plenty of room to relax.  The decor is funky and reflects her style and her travels.  Clean is always a plus for me and that's how the studio presented.  The rooftop deck is awesome with great views to the south across Lake Union.  Location was convenient for us as we had an even at EMP downtown, 5 minutes away! 

Oh, and she left us chocolate and granola bars and some bananas for the road trip back to Portland.  Thanks again, Liz!

I would definitely stay here again. Perfect cozy size for two."
4940491,30722613,2015-04-26,7535364,LeeAnn,"We had a great time at Liz's place in Seattle.  Liz was very easy to communicate with.  We met briefly when we arrived and she showed us around the building and apartment.  Her place is totally charming and in a great part of town-  very walkable and close to lots of restaurants and bars!  She left us a guide about the apartment and area, and some yummy treats! Thanks, Liz!"
4940491,35674049,2015-06-21,10039565,Don,"Had a very enjoyable long weekend in Elizabeth's flat.  It's small but has everything you need.  The bed is very comfy, there's a full kitchen, large bath and it's located in a newer upscale building.  There are lots of interesting books to browse and a great art collection that makes it truly unique and fun.   The roof deck (which is just down the hallway) has a spectacular view and lots of seating, BBQ grills, fireplace and plants.  That was a highlight!

The location is great as well.  I rented a bike and could be anywhere in Fremont or Wallingford in just minutes.  Even without a bike it's a pleasant walk so I never needed a car - which is such a treat!

Elizabeth was friendly, helpful and great to communicate with.  For a single person or couple this is a delightful place and just a short walk from all the energy and excitement of the self-proclaimed center of the universe in Fremont!"
4940491,39826086,2015-07-26,9347519,Matt,"Liz was a helpful host and was very accommodating when my flight was delayed and arrival plans changed. The apartment was clean and comfortable - great for 1 or 2 people on a visit to Seattle. The roof deck is great too, though note that it's not open all day. The area has a lot of stuff within walking distance - Joule restaurant, good coffee, 7-11, more. We had a great stay and I'd definitely come back. "
4940491,44400241,2015-08-25,328505,Hilary,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4940491,46066138,2015-09-07,25634821,Wall-E,Loved the stay. Liz's place is very artsy and cozy. Great stay. 
4940491,49541809,2015-10-04,24683483,Karen,"Elizabeth was very friendly. Communicating with her before/after arrival was easy. Her place is located in the neighborhood where you want to stay. It's close from many neighborhoods including Green Lake, Fremont, U District, etc. We walked everywhere.
We felt safe in her place. Also, her place is very cozy. She has a lot of colorful art works. So much fun!"
1432713,6378424,2013-08-10,5377600,Bill,"I usually stay in high end hotels downtown and did not know what to expect when I decided to stay at Z's apartment.  Thank goodness I did.  I would normally come up to Capital HIll all the time anyway to eat dinner or have drinks with friends.  Great neighborhood.  Great restaurants.  Great vibe all around.  Z is an incredibly considerate and kind person and a phenomenal host. 

Great place for an artist, creative person or someone who appreciates the arts to stay.

 "
1432713,6437689,2013-08-12,7670515,Jess,"My husband and I had such a wonderful experience! Z arranged for an airport pickup for us and even made us dinner reservations. The home was cool and comfortable and was in a perfect location - walking distance from all  the ""action"" and right next to a bus station is you'd prefer to ride instead of walk. 
It was a great experience all around, we would stay here again and would recommend it to others."
1432713,6572782,2013-08-17,1241030,Julia,Probably best to stay elsewhere. We came and left immediately. 
1432713,6747916,2013-08-23,8263220,Joanne,"Z was an AMAZING host!! This was my first AirBnB experience, and I think I'm spoiled forever. First of all, Z's place is absolutely gorgeous---it's full of the most beautiful art + furniture that he made himself---and as fate would have it, he knows the friends I was visiting in Seattle, and they spoke well of him too, so he came amply recommended. He was a gracious host, obviously has hosted lots of people before (he had a ""house rules"" posted, menus from local restaurants, and suggestions of where to explore and what museum exhibits were open right then---a thoughtful tour guide), and he was totally responsive over text / email. The neighborhood is super cute, too, and it's pretty easy to find parking in the area. I would *absolutely* recommend Z's place to anyone traveling to Seattle, especially to artists who want to be surrounded by his awesome creativity in the place and get inspired. Thanks Z!"
1432713,7040009,2013-09-04,3480662,Chloe,"Staying at Z's place was great. The location couldn't be better. It was my first time in Seattle and he was helpful to recommend places to go, restaurants to try, along with how to get around with the bus lines. There is a stop right outside of the building that gets you downtown and to Seattle Center and Pike Place Market. There are eclectic bars and restaurants a few blocks (easy walk) away. There is a wonderful Greek place also in walking distance. 

All in all, I will definitely be staying there next time I'm in Seattle!"
1432713,7408093,2013-09-18,5389593,Libby,"Z's apartment was the perfect place to stay for two days in Seattle. Clean, stylish, and perfectly located. 5 minutes walking to all the shops, bars and restaurants on 15th, and accessible by car from any other part of town. Our host was friendly, helpful and communicated quickly. While we didn't get to meet Mr. Z in person his nephew Drew let us in and brought us pastries our second day.  The bed is comfortable too!

It's an older building, so expect the fixtures to show their age. This didn't bother us though, everything was obviously carefully cleaned and cared for. "
1432713,7715790,2013-09-30,7115,Dani,"Z. is such a sweet host! He was very thoughtful and kind, showed us all we needed to know about his place and gave us recommendations for things to do and eat in the neighborhood. His place is uniquely furnished with his beautiful artwork, you feel like you're getting a bit of a gallery experience with your AirBnB. Great neighborhood, very convenient to Capitol Hill and downtown/ferries/Pike Street Market/etc. "
1432713,7883867,2013-10-07,8695661,Robb,"Mr. Z is a wonderful host, he is incredibly enthusiastic about ensuring a high quality experience for his guests. The apartment is very tidy and clean, as advertised. The location is also unbeatable as there are many walkable cafés, restaurants and parks around to take in. Highly recommended!"
1432713,8064026,2013-10-14,9198889,Henry,"Z's house was lived up to our expectations and then some.  It is in a great part of town and we were easily able to walk to and from capital hill area. The accommodations were clean and beautiful and we had everything that we needed.  Arriving was simple and although i never met Mr. Z personally, we were promptly let in by his nephew when we got there.  I would definitely stay here again! "
1432713,8229614,2013-10-21,2036924,Rebecca,good location near capitol hill. good communication regarding check in process.
1432713,10452577,2014-02-19,506673,Nathaniel,"Z is an excellent airbnb host who is very thoughtful and a great communicator. I had a wonderful time in Seattle walking around the neighborhood of Capitol Hill and very happy to have Z's place as my home base for the week! It's a hip, cozy apt filled with unique furniture and beautiful artwork that is around great restaurants and bars. "
1432713,10717169,2014-03-04,11294663,Camille,"My boyfriend and I could not have asked for a better first AirBnB experience than the one given to us by Mr. Z and his accommodations.  His apartment was incredibly spacious for two people and conveniently located next to public transit, making it easy for us to dart back and forth between downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill.  There were also tons of delicious food options just a short walk away from the apartment building, so it really felt like the entire city was at our fingertips!  "
1432713,11228344,2014-03-25,1196317,Mo,"Nobody can complain about the location. One block, one bus downtown and walking distance to everything on Capital Hill.  Z is great, place is unique and precious (good and bad), and very comfortable except the bed if you are a couple. I don't personally care if Cameron Crow stayed there or knows Z personally. Overall it was great and we had a wonderful sunny weekend in Seattle thanks to z."
1432713,11474125,2014-04-04,13351271,Cari,"Mr. Z graciously allowed us to stay in his apartment for my boyfriend's 40th birthday trip to Seattle. (Z even gave left a birthday card!) Such a great host, Z informed us of the local restaurants, hang outs and attractions - many we would have never known before. Not only do you get to stay in the Singles Apartment building but you get to enjoy his art and eclectic style. So if you are a movie buff or love art and culture, this is a great peaceful place.  
We had a great time!
Beware however if you're tall, the furniture is short! LOL"
1432713,12036263,2014-04-21,14370991,Willem,We had a wonderful stay in Z's apartment. Very convenient location with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It was easy to walk downtown in about 30 minutes. Would stay again on our next visit to Seattle.
1432713,12305998,2014-04-28,14270346,Manek,"The apartment is beautiful, and in a prime location on capital hill.  Z was there waiting for us with the key when we arrived... He gave us the key and a short tour and then left us alone.  Everything was clean and comfortable. The apartment was quiet, and we had no trouble getting a good night's sleep."
1432713,12763939,2014-05-10,9132905,Sunny,"This was a great little apartment. My wife and I spent two nights here and we weren't long feeling right at home here. Located in the artsy area of capital hill (great views from here too) with bus outside door to downtown Seattle.
Zaxxr was a very friendly and attentive host and was very accommodating of our late arrival into Seattle. We also very much appreciated that he had left us coffee and other things for breakfast. Would happily stay here again.  "
1432713,12820584,2014-05-12,933294,Maria Corazon,"Great host, very accommodating, informative and friendly . Beautiful, spacious, artsy  and clean apartment with nice kitchen.

Great location, close to everything! Would definitely stay here again if ever we go back to Seattle. Thanks Mr. Z !"
1432713,13157687,2014-05-20,918719,Jackie,"Fantastic stay in Seattle with possibly the best Air BnB host I've had to date! If you're looking to stay in a quirky, artsy place in the middle of a great, convenient neighborhood, this is the spot! Mr. Z himself is very responsive, friendly, accommodating, and charming. He greeted us after our late arrival into Seattle from NYC, and directed us to some great neighborhood eats in walking distance from the apartment. The apartment itself is in a classic, older building, but it's well appointed and very comfortable. The apartment is super clean, and there is a TV should you get bored or rained out during your stay. The kitchen is well equipped for your needs (though we just made coffee and heated up leftovers), and the bed is comfy. Extra blankets/pillows/towels are available if you need them. Did I mention the neighborhood is great? The apartment is on or very close to several bus lines to get you to and from downtown, and across the street from a nice park. Safeway and QFC supermarkets are in very close walking distance if you need snacks/groceries. Being a museum professional, I am amazed by Mr. Z's collection and am grateful he shares it with his guests. If you truly want to feel like you're staying at ""your favorite uncle's home,"" as he puts it, stay with Mr. Z for a unique experience."
1432713,13290415,2014-05-24,9739435,Maureen,"Mr Z's place was great! It had everything we needed and wanted, and it was super close (walking distance) to a lot of restaurants/bars/parks/etc. Mr Z was a gracious host, and left us a few things in the fridge to get us started. Def would stay here again when I go back to Seattle!"
1432713,13481702,2014-05-28,11400008,Michael,"tl;dr:  Z is awesome, the apartment is awesome, and the neighborhood is awesome.  Stay here.

Z was an awesome host!  He met us at the apartment, showed us around, and gave us some tips on what to see/where to eat.  He was also thoughtful enough to supply us with a hairdryer upon check-in for my wife (we weren't sure if the apartment would have one or not).

The apartment is clean and cozy, and the bed was quite comfortable.  Other tenants at the apartment complex were pleasant and the noise from other apartments was quite minimal (we didn't hear anyone at night/early in the morning).

The part of Capitol Hill where the apartment complex is located is fantastic!  It's a very short walk up to 15th where there are two grocery stores, several coffee shops, and a few amazing restaurants and cafes.  19th ave. is also nearby and has coffee shops like Fuel and several restaurants.  If you want some suggestions on where to eat, ask Z.  He has several options readily available for any meal.

Volunteer Park is a short walk away (check out the views from the water tower!) and there is a bus stop right by the complex that can be used to reach downtown.

We had a fantastic time in Seattle, and we enjoyed renting from Z."
1432713,13885425,2014-06-07,13902818,Bradley,"Mr. Z and his apartment were both great.  Going beyond the call of duty, Mr. Z provided stellar recommendations to local eateries and museums based off our interests.  If you're looking to enjoy Capitol Hill the apartment is in a prime location, while the bus stop across the street makes public transportation to the rest of the city very accessible.  The Apartment itself was extremely clean and outfitted with lots of personality and interesting art.  

I'm hoping we'll have the chance to stay there again sometime soon. 

"
1432713,13987273,2014-06-09,937410,Erinn,"What a great way to spend time in Seattle. First off, it is in the perfect neighborhood to be quiet at night but so easily walkable to more lively areas. We walked all around iconic Capital Hill, Downtown, Lake Union, etc. and never felt like we were too far from ""home."" Mr. Z was such a gracious, helpful, sweet host. He had the apartment dressed with flowers, all the thoughtful amenities you might need, from soap to local coffee and every kind of cream you might want for your coffee. He checked in on us to make sure our stay was pleasant and was just wonderful from start to finish. I could go on forever. Awesomely decorated place, he's extremely knowledgeable of his area. Just great. Can't wait to go back!"
1432713,14683574,2014-06-24,1800027,Jess,"We had an outstanding stay at the home of the very accommodating Mr. Z. We arrived late at night to find him waiting enthusiastically to receive us, with an array of personalized gifts (especially for our two-year-old son) to make our two week stay more comfortable. His home is exceptionally well-located, within walking distance from all the Capitol Hill and Central District restaurants, bars and shops—but not right in the hubbub; the peace and quiet at night kept us all well-rested. There is a great park for children across the street, with a water fountain to wade in on warm days (admittedly few this June). Volunteer and Interlaken Parks are other nearby attractions an easy walk away. 19th Avenue in the easternmost part of Capitol Hill has changed since we lived in Seattle, adding a nice (though pricey) grocery along with a new restaurant and gourmet ice cream along with the good options (the Kingfish and Fuel) that were already there. As for Mr. Z's apartment, it's eclectically and quirkily decorated with interesting art; comfortable and reasonably spacious for a one bedroom; the price is reasonable for Seattle; staying in the Singles building is fun if you have some nineties-era nostalgia; and the host himself could not be more generous and welcoming. We had a rental car and always found parking on 19th just outside the apartment, but bus connections to downtown are also frequent from the bus stop right outside."
1432713,14754697,2014-06-25,14950291,Kaley,"Staying at the 'Singles' movie bldg was an experience. Mr. Z was very outgoing and welcomed us right when we checked in. He showed us around, gave us recommendations and asked about us as people. The apartment was very eclectic. Overall, a pretty good experience."
1432713,14868725,2014-06-28,15669280,Jonathan,"Mr Z is fantastic! Such a great soul and he was very welcoming. The place was impeccably clean when we arrived and he made us feel right at home (plus, the fridge was stocked with the essentials for breakfast!). He gave us great recommendations on places in Seattle to view and was everything you could ask for in a host. Would love to stay here again."
1432713,14998975,2014-06-30,12813107,Kristen,"Mr. Z was a wonderful host! He got my friend and I all set up in the space, and even carried our bags in from the car. He was very thorough when walking us through the space, quickly making us feel at home. He offered wonderful dining recommendations and was just all-around a very nice guy! The space was very clean and well looked after. "
1432713,15152272,2014-07-03,16113891,Ahmad,"What a gracious host with one of the most beautiful, clean and unique apartments in Seattle's quaint neighborhood, Capitol Hill.  Mr. Z did anything and everything to make us feel comfortable and at home.  He gave us many wonderful recommendations on places to eat, destinations to see and things to do, most of which we did and all of which made our trip that much more memorable.  The apartment itself is close to many great restaurants and bars and right beside a bus stop that will take you to downtown in 10 minutes or less. Overall, Mr. Z is one cool dude and our stay wouldn't have been the same without him!"
1432713,15324780,2014-07-07,15741364,Joshua,"Mr. Z's place is very quirky and fun, and great for what we needed. Lots of great art, very clean, certainly comfortable. Conveniently located near some great dining (if you get a chance to try the ice-cream and cookies at 'Hello, Robin!' you really must), and a few of the transit stops. He was a very gracious host, and helped us out with plenty of useful tips for our stay in Seattle."
1432713,15498006,2014-07-10,5093333,Daniel,"Mr. Z's pad is top-notch.  My girlfriend and I had a great stay there, the place is comfortable, and very conveniently located.  We had a rental car, yet we never used it once!  Also, Mr. Z (aka The Man Himself) was very responsive and had the place extremely clean and orderly upon arrival.  I highly recommend staying here!"
1432713,15554362,2014-07-11,6104733,Liam,"Place was great, and Z was around to meet us when we arrived.  We had a great time in Seattle, and we were happy to have a place so close to a happening neighbourhood. "
1432713,15640300,2014-07-13,7548526,Mitch,"Z's place was great! Clean, quiet, and tastefully decorated. He's also quite the repository of local knowledge, and a visionary for future endeavors. Enjoyed staying in his abode as much as we enjoyed meeting him. Cheers!"
1432713,15822170,2014-07-16,15582475,John & Tracy,"How could a college grad circa 1992 pass up the opportunity to stay in an apartment building from the iconic 90s movie, Singles? It was the movie connection that caught our eye, but Z made it much more than that.

First off, the location on Capitol Hill is ideal for anyone looking for a lively scene, and it was easily to get to many other Seattle neighborhoods and tourist hot spots from the apartment. 
The space that Z has created is sleekly eclectic - warm and hip, funky and comfortable at the same time.  It felt like our own personal modern art museum at times. 

Z himself is infectiously enthusiastic. He wasted no time filling us in on the myriad of options awaiting us. Every restaurant or local watering hole suggestion was spot on; we enjoyed them all.

Our travels rarely take us back to the same place twice, but if we ever find ourselves once more in Seattle, ours and Z's paths will definitely cross again."
1432713,15878089,2014-07-17,2780048,Lauren,We had a great stay at Mr. Z's awesomely eclectic apartment. He was there to greet us and show us around the apt upon arrival and was very friendly. The place was super clean and tidy and the bed was really comfortable! His place is highly curated with beautiful artwork and really cool knick knacks. Great location. Very convenient. Would definitely stay here and again and highly recommend. 
1432713,15936303,2014-07-18,4016840,Alice,"I loved staying at Mr. Z's super stylish yet comfortable apartment. I used to live on Capitol Hill, and the location is perfect to explore Seattle. Despite the heat wave, the apartment was shady and comfortable. Thank you Mr. Z for a great experience!"
1432713,16205704,2014-07-23,2908848,Curt & Michele,"We're not sure if we can add anything new , but we would definitely echo all the previous reviews. Mr. Z has a cool place and we certainly enjoyed staying there. The location was a perfect home base for our Seattle excursions. Z was out of town during most of our stay, but we did catch up with him right as we were leaving. Z is very knowledgeable on all things Seattle, so he is a great resource. The apartment was very comfortable and we would not hesitate to stay there again."
1432713,16328832,2014-07-25,17616352,Shay,"Mr Z. Was an amazing host! He immediately gave us great recommendations, and made us feel very welcomed.
The apartment was meticulously clean with a very unique and interesting design, definitely different than your average regular apartment. 
Another thing worth mentioning is that the neighbourhood is very trendy with a nice selection of restaurants and bars, also felt very safe.
If we ever come back to Seattle, we will be very happy to stay there again! "
1432713,16465100,2014-07-28,831913,Gayla,"Z. made my husband and me feel very welcome.  His apartment is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transportation to city parks and downtown, and walking distance to Trader Joe's, a great food co-op and Safeway.  Also, Z. recommended that we try Tallulah's, a wonderful restaurant less than ten minutes' walk from the apartment, where we enjoyed a lovely meal in a nice setting.  The apartment is hung with really interesting artwork that reflect Z.'s sensibility.  He is friendly and made us feel at home.  One detail that I especially liked were the fresh flowers that greeted us on our arrival.  It was also convenient to be able to do laundry in the building."
1432713,17283999,2014-08-10,16580330,Jennifer,"Incredible hospitality, location, and ambiance!  Thanks Z!"

The apartment was in an excellent location in Capitol Hill and provided a great base for us to explore seattle. It was comfortable and clean with lots of interesting artwork! My girlfriend and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "
1432713,17590534,2014-08-14,6271151,Nicole,"Z was a fantastic host, his apartment was gorgeous, real flair for design. It was close to the bus, which takes you right downtown. We traveled with our toddler, he left he a pink elephant as a present and books to read. I would stay there again and recommend it to friends and all airb&b travelers. Beats a hotel any day!   "
1432713,17618442,2014-08-15,9837608,Kaleigh And Remy,"Mr. Z was so hospitable and full of amazing suggestions. Helpful all the way and had super sonic response time. His apartment was beautiful, clean, and located in a very cute part of town. My boyfriend and I are huge Singles fans as well so that was a very exciting part for us! I would recommend this property and this host 100%"
1432713,18006878,2014-08-20,17361427,Sarah,"Mr Z. was a fantastic host! He gave us good suggestions for restaurants and site seeing, the apartment was clean and full of light, and we had a wonderful experience in Seattle. The apartment is in a great location! Easy to walk to tons of restaurants and grocery stores. The bus stops right in front, and it's close enough to walk to downtown too. We had an excellent experience staying here!"
1432713,18069619,2014-08-21,10015316,Doug &,"Very well furnished apartment in walking distance to great restaurants and nightlife, but also located directly on the bus line which makes it a very convenient spot if you choose to venture out or are visiting without a car. Z's recommendations were spot on and we thoroughly enjoyed his open, inviting demeanor.  "
1432713,18130720,2014-08-22,9874040,Marguery,"Mr. Z was more than accommodating with our flexible check-in time and the apartment was spotless! He was very hospitable, with many recommendations for an off-the-grid Seattle experience."
1432713,18238355,2014-08-24,16528942,Alessandro,"Everything was perfect! the apartment is located in Capitol Hill, a quite and beautiful neighborhood, just in front of the bus stop. From there you can get bus no. 43 to downtown and no. 8 to the city centre. 
The apartment is a good choice for Singles movie funs, well furnished and clean. It is definitely a good point to start your trip, and Mr. Z. was very helpful with lots of precious suggests! We had a great time. "
1432713,18436041,2014-08-26,19282903,Jen,"Mr. Z was a great host. He let us in on local spots and sights, which are all easy to walk to.  The area is beautiful and easy to get to. The parking is just street parking but on the weekend it was easy to find right in front of the building. The apartment had great art pieces we looked at and enjoyed. It was very clean and Mr. Z even left a great bottle of beer for us in the fridge! Being right on a Main Street it was fairly quiet with the windows open. The bed was very comfortable. "
1432713,18546433,2014-08-28,7378839,Pip,"Mr Z was a fabulous host, extremely welcoming! He helped us carry our rather heavy luggage into the apartment and then spent some time with us patiently explaining how everything works in the apartment and where everything was, and in the most humorous and charming way! 
The apartment was super lovely with lots of interesting objects d'art dotted around. The bed was very comfy and we slept brilliantly. The shower was a waterfall shower with good water pressure.
The neighborhood was quiet and friendly and we felt very safe there. We walked to a bar down the road and had no concerns about walking back late at night.
The experience of staying in the Singles movie building was great for me as I loved the film when it came out and it felt like staying on a movie set!
All in all a great experience staying at Mr Z's!!! We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to other travelers. Five stars!!
"
1432713,18602286,2014-08-28,2873985,Shaina,Mr. Z is a generous and kind host. He made us feel right at home. The space is beautiful and unique. A must stay!
1432713,18789865,2014-09-01,6486201,Jenny,"We enjoyed staying at Z's place!  It was very clean and he was very helpful and friendly when we arrived, he let us know the best places to eat and about the bus routes.  The kitchen is well stocked with cooking necessities, so it made it easy to cook our meals.  Parking is very easy to find in the neighborhood, too!  Z even brought us new flowers half way through our stay and took out the garbage!  What a guy!  We hope Z's apartment is available next time we visit Seattle!  Also- location is GREAT and the apartment was EXACTLY as described in the listing!"
1432713,18982360,2014-09-04,1149618,Jessica,"Mr Z was a fab host, with lots of spirit and good advice about restaurants and other places to check out in the neighbourhood (Tallulah's on 19th is a great dinner spot and ice-cream place nearby is heavenly). He was flexible with our check-in time and met us at the flat to give us a tour. 

The flat itself was very comfortable and had everything we needed. 

Couldn't recommend the neighbourhood more, which was pretty quiet, but close to some great spots and easy walking distance to all that Capitol Hill has to offer, plus an easy bus ride away from downtown/Pike Place market, etc.

Thanks Mr Z for your hospitality and all the best. 
Jessica & Niall "
1432713,19036290,2014-09-05,5511352,Andrea,This is a great little apartment in a really walkable and fun hood.  Mr.Z was a wonderful host and gave us a breakfast recommendation all our friends loved.  Fun stay if you like to travel and feel like a local for a night or two!
1432713,19194565,2014-09-08,12201978,Dan,"Z was an enthusiastic and energetic host! Staying in his apartment was fantastic as we got to experience Seattle like a real local. Capitol Hill is the best location - loads of bars, eateries and shops in every direction, plus all very cool. The apartment has lots of quirky nic-nacs to intrigue. Z had left us lots of provisions such as beer, coffee, milk, juice, flowers etc. He was on hand for advice and tips which was great. Thanks Z!"
1432713,19304715,2014-09-09,7450524,Sarah,"The apartment was awesome, and the host both friendly and accommodating. Great experience overall!"
1432713,19330289,2014-09-10,8795785,Arnie & Patti,"""Mr Z"" was the perfect host.  He gave us excellent advice on what to do for our too-short one night's stay:  a few blocks' stroll to Volunteer Park to its dahlia garden,  a walk up its water tower for a fabulous view of Seattle and then on the return route an exceptional meal at an informal and creative neighborhood restaurant, Tallulah's. The apartment has such eclectic furnishings that were I to relate it to something in my hometown of San Francisco it would be a cross between The Castro and The Mission. Since we had a rental car for a week's trip we did not find parking to be a problem. We did notice lots of bus routes nearby.  So, a great stay. - Arnie Gubins"
1432713,19400676,2014-09-11,21143413,Ranganath,"Mr. Z was awesome. Even though he was not in town, he made sure that someone was there to greet and make me feel at home.

1432713,20250424,2014-09-26,1564494,Divya,"Mr Z's place was the perfect jumping off point for exploring Seattle. The Capitol Hill neighborhood has so many great cafés and restaurants within walking distance (and Z provides great recs of the best ones to try) and access to bus routes that can get you anywhere in the city. The space itself is delightful, with both a great design aesthetic and lots of soul that says every piece in the house has a special significance. Mr. Z himself is a colorful, funny, thoughtful, and warm personality that instantly makes you feel at home and talking to him about his extensive travels when I checked in was one of the best parts of the experience. I had never seen the movie ""Singles"" before staying in the apartment but did soon thereafter and it adds an extra fun dimension to an already beautiful place. I can't wait to stay again next time I'm in the city!"
1432713,20350310,2014-09-28,20278341,Jennifer,"Mr. Z was a wonderful and informative host. In addition to providing us with a beautiful, clean place to stay - with seriously unique art and furniture throughout the apartment - he let us know what nearby restaurants, bars and coffee shops to try out in Capital Hill. We absolutely loved our time at Mr. Z's place. "

We were blocks away from many shops and restaurants, and the 43 bus pretty much takes you to the door! Z was responsive, friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this apartment."

He was super-flexible (much appreciated) about my changing arrival time, met me with the keys and also even arranged a lift back to the apartment for me. Really awesome! His apartment is great - really artistic, well-designed with a lot of space and a really peaceful vibe. I haven't watched the Single's Movie yet but plan to! The location is great as well - easy walk to nice restaurants and an amazing mega-deli on 19th, and in the other direction there's a Safeway really nearby. Of all the AirBnBs I stayed in on this trip (four on the West Coast), this is the one where I relaxed the most. I really liked staying at Mr Z's place and hope to stay again in the future!"

He also recommended plenty of things to do around Seattle as well as recommended amazing restaurants nearby. Z was very accommodating and always available by phone or e-mail and responded to all my questions very quickly. Parking was easily accessible by street parking (free all day). Z's home is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and is very close to all the excitement going on in Capitol Hill and just a few minutes drive away from Pike Place Market. He also left plenty of fresh towels, juice, beer and bathroom essentials. Overall, Z's home was spectacular and has a lot of amazing culture inside. Next time I make a stop in Seattle, I will definitely stay here again."
1432713,21954403,2014-10-27,21248018,Beth,"Great place to stay if you want to get s true feeling of Seattle. The space was cozy and we walked everywhere all over Seattle from Capital Hill, the neighborhood where this apartment is located. There are some of the best restaurants in the city within a half mile walk of this place. Everything was clean and the bed was soooo comfortable after a long day of exploring. Make sure to stay here if you are visiting the city. You won't regret it!"
1432713,22548731,2014-11-09,1588473,Kate,"Z was there to meet me at the apartment with keys and open arms. He was very accommodating, and I appreciated his flexibility because my arrival time kept changing and he was able to be there. His apartment was awesome, spotlessly clean, and it was amazing to get to see all of his amazing artwork and collection of artifacts from around the world. Z was very thoughtful, helpful, and also provided some amazing restaurant recommendations. 

Thank you so much Z! "
1432713,22967097,2014-11-18,11807104,Dustin,"The host was incredibly accommodating and the apartment was immaculate. The apartment is eclectic and has quite an interesting layout but the kitchen was larger than expected and stocked with quality necessities. 

The neighborhood is quiet but still close enough to walk to a variety of restaurants, stores, and landmarks. I loved this location and felt very safe even at night. 

I would highly recommend staying at this location."

1432713,25778016,2015-01-25,20415235,Stephanie,My son and I really enjoyed our stay. We spent the weekend going to museums and parks. The location was great. Z's nephew made sure we had everything we needed. We felt safe and comfortable. I would recommend this space to friends and family. 
1432713,25939685,2015-01-30,18282235,Georgia,"I had a wonderful stay at Mr Z's apartment. Conveniently located, stylishly designed/eclectic space. Mr Z was extremely communicative throughout the whole process and although he was out of town he had his nephew greet me upon arrival and so graciously show me around, he even bought me coffee & fresh flowers which was super sweet."

1432713,29216757,2015-04-05,29828079,Drew,"Loved this place. We were greeted by Mr. Z on arrival. He was the first person we met in Seattle, and was also by far the most interesting. If you've got a few minutes for some of his stories, it's definitely worth your time. He also has a wealth of local knowledge, so if you need recommendations, he's your dude. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Probably will next time we're in town. Thanks Mr. Z!"
1432713,29607137,2015-04-10,2104494,Joseph,"Great place.  Z is a fantastic host; the place is clean, comfortable, and decorated with lots of excellent and very distinctive artwork.  Bus to downtown/attractions stops outside the front door.  (You can also walk downtown if you have the time and a little motivation.) Only downside is that the upstairs neighbors were early risers during my stay, and they woke me up a little earlier than I might have liked. "
1432713,30116581,2015-04-17,19481413,Tauseef,Z. is one of the most creative people I have ever met. His home is like an art museum. The rent goes towards his non-profit which does great work in Latin America. This place isn't to be missed.
1432713,30259366,2015-04-19,31106376,Sebastian,"Mr. Z has a wealth of knowledge and experience from his travels around the globe that he loves to share, very nice guy and extremely welcoming.

Thank you"
1432713,31371881,2015-05-04,31533367,Ziru,"Z was a very welcoming host. He was responsive and friendly. His place is clean and conveniently located. Street parking is readily available. We never had to walk a full block to the front door. The unit is in an older apartment building, so you may hear the neighbors coming in and out of the building or heavy steps from the unit above, but never at a late hour. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this stylish home."
1432713,31773986,2015-05-10,28289287,Meagan,"We had a wonderful stay in Mr. Z's beautiful home while we were in Seattle!

1432713,32043431,2015-05-12,14379986,Crystal & Mitch,"After some telephone confusion, Z was quite accommodating; giving us a tour of the apartment, suggestions on dinner places and good living advice.  His apartment was clean and full of interesting mementos of his travels.  My favorite was a coffee table book: Homes of the World.  A quiet and peaceful place to retreat to from the hub-hub of Seattle."
1432713,32286101,2015-05-16,9922419,Jamie,"Great location and pretty comfy place. Z is very attentive and professional and has some interesting pieces of furniture and decoration. He was extremely accommodating in meeting me to give me the key as he raced to get to the airport. Thanks again! Only negative is that there's a pretty musty smell in the apartment. Overall, good stay."
1432713,32381804,2015-05-17,31995298,Henry,Had a great time at Mr. Z's. Perfect location--cool neighborhood and a straight shot towards all the spots we wanted to check out. Z's apt is really nice and he's got a great sense of style.

1432713,32977324,2015-05-24,5295478,Naoko,"We had a great stay at Mr. Z's - the location was more in the residential part of Capitol Hill, but close to shops and restaurants, which we definitely took advantage of. The unit was comfortable - plenty of space for two people - and tastefully decorated. An all-around great ""home base"" to have when visiting Seattle!"
1432713,33156393,2015-05-25,7660025,Sarah,"We had a great overnight stay at Mr. Z's place. The localization is really great and there are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and a Safeway close by. The place was very clean, which was also great. We didn't get a chance to meet Mr. Z, who was out of town, but his nephew and neighbor were super friendly! Mr Z. was kind enough to give me a call as we were checking out to make sure everything went ok. My only suggestions are an extra chair for the kitchen (the table sits one) and an upgrade on the mattress, but those really weren't a problem for our short stay!"
1432713,33508621,2015-05-29,5484495,Jake,"Very much as described, great location, overall very pleasant stay!"
1432713,33589301,2015-05-30,24762285,Alyson,This place is great. We love the neighborhood - parked the car (for free on the street a block away) and walked everywhere - and really appreciated how clean and comfortable the apartment was. 
1432713,33841465,2015-06-01,33270687,Bill,Mr. Z was a great host providing useful local advice on places of interest. The apartment and location had everything I needed to be comfortable during my stay. I would definitely consider staying at Mr.Z's place.

1432713,34638037,2015-06-10,5623011,Melissa,"Mr. Z. welcomed us with lots of energy and great tips for things to do around the neighborhood. There are a couple of restaurants & cafes, a little shop, and Volunteer Park within a quick walk. I'm not sure whether this is an ideal walking/public transportation location as we had a car and Seattle neighborhoods seem fairly spread out, but we found street parking easily and saw a bus stop with at least a couple lines nearby.   The bed was soft, but comfortable with great linens.  Z. provided us a fan that kept us cool enough to sleep during the warm days. The bedroom was a bit bright but the light got us going in the a.m. All in all we had a comfortable, easy stay. "
1432713,35202446,2015-06-16,29094849,Milind,"We had a very comfortable stay at Z's house. It's centrally located, in a safe neighbourhood with a supermarket and good restaurants nearby. Downtown is near and well connected by bus. Z was there to greet us even though we landed up at almost midnight. He kept a well stocked kitchen for us which was very thoughtful of him. Thank you Z for a memorable stay.

Milind"
1432713,35403307,2015-06-18,5126574,Dorothy,"Mr Z's nephew met me at the apartment and was very nice to even come by a little earlier on short notice. The place is so cool- very artistic and centrally located. Parking was easy and we walked a lot as well as took uber for no more than $10 to get anywhere we wanted to go. 
It's not a kitchen to cook- but we didn't have time for this anyway. It's a great way to stay in Seattle without hassle. Thanks Mr. Z!"
1432713,35921806,2015-06-23,7885936,Alison,"We had a great stay in Seattle! The apartment was perfect - great location a short walk to great cafes and bars on 15th and 19th Aves, and very cute style that felt like a home not a hotel. Mr Z was beyond helpful with tips on things to do. Would definitely recommend."
1432713,36049676,2015-06-24,35508243,Josh,"Z was there to greet us when we arrived. He is a highly energetic and fun person. He showed us around, supplied us with towels, gave a few suggestions for dinner and walks, and then made himself scarce - the perfect combination of hospitable and non-intrusive."
1432713,36382936,2015-06-28,10161452,Susannah,Mr. Z's apartment is in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops nearby and has easy access to downtown. We loved the location and the apartment itself. Mr. Z was extremely helpful and very enthusiastic about giving us suggestions and tips on things to do/see. He also is very easy to reach and always responds quickly. Highly recommend!
1432713,37611546,2015-07-08,23787400,Dana,Dru was a very welcoming host!  He double checked to see that we had everything.  What phenomenal art in the space!  And a super great location.  Z  was communicative and made sure everything was *just so*.  Highlight of the stay was a great meal at one of the many restaurants within walking distance.  
1432713,37830788,2015-07-11,27302086,Kristen,"We had a really nice time staying at Z's place. It was very convenient to buses and restaurant and the place was really quiet. Super comfy bed too! Z wasn't there to meet us, but his nephew met us to collect the keys and the bus timetables and tips on things to do that Z left were very helpful. My only regret was that I couldn't stay longer!"
1432713,38610122,2015-07-17,12237803,Lucy,"Cute, older apartment. Z is a very gracious host and had a lot of good food recommendations! Building and neighborhood are very quiet at night. Great location. "

1432713,39486386,2015-07-24,17367634,Joel,"Host was not very welcoming to us....we actually were a bit uncomfortable and did have 2nd thought of should we stay.  No other comments....not sure who the prior people are who commented such pleasant things about host but we honestly can't do the same.  Very unfortunate. 
The listing was accurate however, cleanliness of condo was not."
1432713,39928202,2015-07-27,6729125,Ellen,"Mr Z. met us at the apartment and spent a long time describing the local area to us and his work. The apartment is nice and the furniture is interesting. If you're looking for a home away from home then I would say this is probably not the right place (not sure you could really cook anything here & no table to eat at etc. so you're advised to eat out), but if you want to just use it as base to go off and see Seattle then that's all fine!"
1432713,40227810,2015-07-29,15642425,Shannon,Very nice place in a great neighborhood.  Close to public transportation and all the tourist attractions you'll want to visit on your trip to Seattle.
1432713,40732150,2015-08-02,893529,Timothy,Mr. Z was very helpful and had many recommendations for places to eat nearby.  The apartment was tidy and well decorated with unique artifacts.  Location is great for walking to Capitol Hill and Volunteer Park with convenient bus connection to downtown.  
1432713,42295893,2015-08-12,35638113,Lauren,"This place is absolutely stunning! Mr Z met us at the apartment and gave us a short tour of his place (which is completely accurate to the description). Everything was clean, the artwork was really neat, the bed was just right (and holy wow the shower head was amazing!!) and the location was perfect. We were walking distance to volunteer park, Safeway, and many cafés and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again next time I travel to Seattle :]"
1432713,43388180,2015-08-19,13874284,Krista,"Z was an amazing host! He was super friendly and gave us great suggestions for restaurants in the neighborhood. And the apartment was absolutely beautiful - gorgeous artwork, very clean, a comfortable bed, and all the amenities we would need. The location was perfect for us - within easy walking distance to everything on Capitol Hill, but it also has several bus lines with stops almost right outside the building. We highly recommend staying at Z's apartment if you are planning a visit to Seattle!"
1432713,43615692,2015-08-21,1759384,Jo,"I don't think there is enough space to write how much we enjoyed staying at Mr Z's apartment.
Upon arrival, we received a warm welcome from the very well traveled, vibrant & talented Z himself.
The apartment was a lot larger than we expected it to be with a lot of natural light, it was also clean, tidy & beautifully decorated.
It should also be mentioned that the bed was amazingly comfortable! I miss it already!
The neighborhood & location was perfect for us- ample street parking, transport was literally at the front door, a short walk to local supermarkets & restaurants aswell as central to Capitol Hill & the CBD.

Don't even bother considering hotels when visiting Seattle, Mr Z's apartment is safe, inviting, comfortable & incredible value for money.
We love this apartment so much!
"
1432713,43881325,2015-08-22,8719872,Jack,"Only a one night stay for us, but a clean, comfortable and stylish place to stay. Would second Mr. Z's recommendation of Monsoon nearby, superb cocktails and great food."
1432713,44312163,2015-08-25,3210322,Ariane,"A great place to stay in Seattle! The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable.  Also, the bus stop is right in front of the apartment complex so we were able to access all different Seattle neighborhoods with ease.  There are great restaurants and bars within walking distance as well as a food market.  Although we didn't meet Mr. Z, he made it very easy to check in and out.  He also provided excellent suggestions for things to do/see/eat in town.  We would highly recommend staying in this apartment !"
1432713,45074170,2015-08-31,29454162,Michael,"Excellent all round. The apartment was clean, conveniently located and had everything we could possibly need.

1432713,45320264,2015-09-01,14394911,Charles Parker,Cloudy and mystical Seattle's own MR. Z! What a true gentleman. Lover of hair and tons of other good things don't stay anywhere else but his pad. His smile and enthusiasm will rocket your stay into a new orbit. Energy wise the place feels exactly right. Say what's up to the dinosaur in the fridge. Super rad time! 
1432713,45585985,2015-09-04,6139993,Anna,Mr. Z was very nice and welcoming. He had a great recommendation for dinner. We only stayed one night but the apartment is in a great neighborhood and close to everything. It's clean and cozy. Highly recommend staying here!
1432713,45774216,2015-09-06,33893509,Catherine,Z's apartment was the perfect place to stay during our short trip to Seattle. Z gave us the warmest welcome upon our arrival. He had lots of interesting stories from his experiences locally and abroad. It's a shame we didn't get to stay longer to take advantage of his many suggestions for food and activities around Seattle. The apartment reflected his personality - very interesting and welcoming. Would love to stay again if ever in Seattle. Thanks again Z!
1432713,45996119,2015-09-07,6918353,Laurel,I very much enjoyed my stay in Z's beautiful apartment. The location was fantastic and Z was a gracious and friendly host. I would definitely return and recommend to others!

1432713,46456353,2015-09-10,6373034,Josh,"We had an excellent stay at Mr. Z's cool and eclectic capitol hill pad!  It's full of wonderful art and fixtures.  Great location to explore Capital Hill, and the rest of Seattle.  Mr. Z was an great host. Gave us the full tour, found us a primo parking spot, and made us feel very much at home.  Highly recommend staying here!"
1432713,46490170,2015-09-11,9472811,Ashley,Z was an amazing host.  I wish we had more time to stay in the apartment and more time to talk to him as he seems to be extremely smart and have been around the world!! I was in awe throughout our stay looking at the all the art and furniture.  The place is within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  Would def. stay there again if we ever venture back to Seattle.
1432713,46583261,2015-09-12,5580145,Tiffany,"Mr. Z was the perfect host!  Very communicative, helpful and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again!"
1432713,47129712,2015-09-15,43809273,George,"Z. has a beautiful, spotless space. He had great suggestions for exploring the city, and was incredibly welcoming! Highly recommend this option. "
1432713,47700039,2015-09-21,40623437,Seth,My father had a great experience.  Z was helpful and kind and the stay and accommodations were very much enjoyable!
1432713,49496803,2015-10-04,40140144,David,Perfect location to explore Capitol Hill! Z was very helpful and accommodating to our schedule.
1432713,49781390,2015-10-06,39258950,Starr,"Although Mr. Z was welcoming and friendly, I was not entirely comfortable staying here. My main concern was the ax on the wall (hanging next to the gun on the wall) that was inscribed with ""to my favorite ax murderer."" I feel like the job of the host is to make the guest feel safe and welcome in a new place, and this made me feel nervous and scared. I actually stayed in a hotel both nights. "
1432713,50034852,2015-10-08,22521586,Kristin,We enjoyed our one night stay at Z's apartment. His dinner recommendation for Monsoon was very good. Thank you for an enjoyable stay. 
1432713,50203305,2015-10-10,10229016,Marcus,"This is a great place in a really fun neighbourhood. There's lots going on in Capitol Hill, and it's within easy walking distance of downtown. Z's place is a really interesting space with a lot of character, and makes a great Seattle base. "
1432713,50347693,2015-10-11,21944120,Sara,"Z was friendly and gracious.  The apartment was lovely and full of fascinating art!  Ours was a short stay, so we did not get to take full advantage of his hospitality- but the apartment was well stocked with everything we could need.  We would definitely stay there again!  Thanks Z!"
1432713,50801203,2015-10-14,905294,Emunah,"Location is fantastic for experiencing the less obvious, most charming districts of Capitol Hill. We loved Mr. Z's recommendations - he is very helpful and on point, with impeccable taste. "
1432713,51346836,2015-10-19,10492859,Viktoriya,"Mr.Z met me at his apartment, he seemed friendly. The location of the apt. Is great. The place was clean but had a funky smell, we tried opening the window and putting the air on as mr.Z suggested but the smell would not go away.  Two days before we were supposed to check out mr. Z showed up unannounced and said he needs to get a hat from the apt. 
Next thing you know he is sorting out the place and taking garbage out etc.. The way the apt. is he has his personal things everywhere so if you want to unpack and use the table for example your things will be next to his. He starts rearranging his stuff on the table (mostly postcards etc.) which felt very invasive . We rented the place for a few days and having him come in in the middle of our stay and do that didn't feel right. The day we were checking out I asked if there's any way we can leave our luggage there or somewhere else since our flight was late at night . He said no that the place was rented out (which wasn't true it was available online) 
"
1432713,51914971,2015-10-25,43728448,Michael,We were really happy with everything!!
1432713,53212263,2015-11-06,10662445,Patrick,The apartment is in a great location and Z is a fantastic host. Would highly recommend staying here. 
1432713,58107801,2015-12-31,50668466,Andrew,Thanks again I had a good time at your place. .
6209191,32036162,2015-05-12,14015999,Angie,"Enjoyed our stay very much.  Our room was very comfortable, immaculate, and perfect for our budget stay in Seattle.  Great location in a beautiful greenbelt neighborhood.  Enjoyed the historic charm of the home, especially the soaking tub after a long day of sightseeing.   Michael was a gracious host, making sure that we had all that we needed.  Thank you for a great stay!  We will be back!"
6209191,32212015,2015-05-15,22100353,Jake,Michael has a great place in a great location! He was extremely helpful and I would definitely stay here again.
6209191,32642243,2015-05-19,8332757,Mayte,Our stay at Michael'a place was outstanding. His home is clean and tidy. Extremely easy to find and ample parking available. It's in a beautiful neighborhood and everything is a short 1-3 mile distance from his home(downtown/pike place/lake Washington). Mike is very welcoming and communication was never a problem he even left the lights on when we were out late night. We will def be back. Our stay was extraordinaire. Thank you Michael your place is awesome and the decor/ lighting is amazing. Loved it
6209191,33393369,2015-05-27,32550936,Nathan,"This house is absolutely fantastic, and Michael is equally as good a host. The neighbourhood is green, quiet, and very friendly. Great access to both public transit and cycling paths for those of us who don't drive."
6209191,33732127,2015-05-31,26550130,Lee,"Great experience -- terrific location and Michael was a very gracious host. We had a car, but still appreciated that we could walk to neighborhood restaurants and a nearby park. Very comfy bed, cozy room, tranquil vibe. "
6209191,33934529,2015-06-02,4613250,Si,"Michael is a very nice host, he helped us to plan the trip. He drove us to some of the attractions when he picked us up at the airport. The house is super clean and nice. The neighborhood is quite and close to lake union. Highly recommend."
6209191,35484172,2015-06-19,32531948,Emile,"Michael's place is very nice. It's in a quiet area, yet it was very easy to access Downtown. It's right next to a couple bus stops. My hosts were very friendly. The room was well prepared. The house is very clean. Madrona is a very nice neighborhood and I highly recommend Michael's place if you are exploring the city."
4026757,19450581,2014-09-12,9444184,Rachel,"Unfortunately, I was only able to take advantage of Roland's wonderful house for one night but a very nice night. Roland is a great host, very concerned that everything was just so. A lovely stay. Recommend for sure. Plus, right by green lake and wallingford which has Molly's moons ice cream. Roland has done a super job with his house. "
4026757,19662341,2014-09-15,14538807,Duane,"The room, Roland's home, the neighborhood and especially Roland were perfect in everyway.  We thoroughly enjoyed our too short one night stay, and look forward to staying with him again on our next visit to Seattle."
4026757,19991033,2014-09-21,14147320,Claude,"I cannot find word to appreciate the my host Roland. The house, the location and the service (yes, Roland provides you lots to eat)  are excellent. What's more, the host is very nice person and warmhearted. Not only provide a place for sleeping, he also try to make friend with the guest and share his experience of interest. 
I have no car, and Roland take me to downtown, show me the city, and even take me to the airport. I am so appreciate. I've shared my experience and my friends told me that when they in Seattle, they will let me introduce them to (website hidden), I am expecting my friend Roland to Beijing, China. "
4026757,20067648,2014-09-22,7654290,Martha,It was a pleasure to stay at Roland's home in Seattle! Roland was very hospitable and the place was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Really cool house too just north of Seattle! Would definitely recommend staying here.
4026757,20172750,2014-09-24,500927,Debbie,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great one! Roland was very welcoming and accommodating; giving me a tour of his lovely home, offering anything I needed to make me feel at home. From plenty of bottled water, telling me exactly how the washer works, sharing his Apple TV and I can't forget the chocolate left on the bed when entering the room.  I was out and about my two days when I was here but never felt I was intruding on Roland - it was a very comfortable experience. The neighborhood is filled with friendly neighbors and lovely Arts and Craft style houses.  I would definitely stay here again and anytime in Seattle. "
4026757,20265958,2014-09-26,21602896,Souk,"As a first time user of Airbnb I was a little hesitant to try. However Roland and his space completely made me feel at home. Affordable and a great way to meet other travelers and welcoming hosts.

The room was exactly as pictured with comfy sheets and plentiful pillows. Quiet, a great retreat after being out in the woods all day.

Roland began a map of all his visitors. I was lucky to have the honor of being the first to pin my flag. Definitely looking forward to returning and seeing this map grow with guests and memories."
4026757,20474913,2014-09-29,21576909,Marc,"This was my first experience with Airbnb. Roland went completely above and beyond! He completely surpassed any expectation I could of had. The house was beautiful, clean and in safe neighborhood. The house is also close to Ballard which is convenient for anyone who wants to spend time in that area. I definitely plan on coming back!"
4026757,20801341,2014-10-05,15894256,Holger,Very warm welcome. Roland is a great host and had a lot of useful tips. We really enjoyed our stay. The room we stayed in was really nice and clean. The neighborhood is also great. We would stay there again any time.
4026757,20933053,2014-10-07,21859193,Siobhan,"Roland made us feel super welcome. He has a great outgoing personality and wants to be really helpful. 
The house was darling and in a nice quite neighborhood. Not far from a park and lots of food options. "
4026757,21314302,2014-10-14,8334992,Alex,"An excellent experience from start to finish. I recommend this listing.
The listing is as described--clean, quiet, well-furnished, and in a safe location. The house is halfway between two popular neighborhoods and only a few blocks from the outdoors of Green Lake.
Roland was the perfect host. He made me feel welcome, is an interesting conversationalist, and shared his knowledge of the city and neighborhood."
4026757,21441182,2014-10-17,3444252,Lee,"From the super-comfy bed, to the big plush towels, heated bathroom floor, and the Fiji water and chocolate welcoming gifts, Roland's house is true luxury. I've been staying here each week I've been to Seattle for business, and I plan to continue to stay here each week for the foreseeable future. 

If you need space to work, there's plenty of room in the work area. And if you just want to kick back and relax, you can do that in the living room—Roland invites everyone to watch Apple TV on the big screen and browse the vast collection of things to watch.

The location is perfect for a quick walk to downtown Wallingford where there are plenty of restaurants and shops. And if walking isn't your thing, driving to a nearby eatery or even a gas station takes but mere minutes.

I'd love to keep this place a secret if I could, but I must give credit where credit is due. Give Roland's place a try... you won't be disappointed."
4026757,22045034,2014-10-28,5340823,Cory,"We had a fantastic time at Roland's home.  Our room was bright and clean, and with the king sleigh bed, we slept like babies!  Roland is a great host who provided us with good conversation - he was flexible with our check-in arrangements and gave recommendations for food and coffee. "
4026757,22505238,2014-11-08,1591605,Jody,"I so very much enjoyed my stay in the Yellow Suite.  It was the perfect place to lay my head and enjoy a very clean, inviting home.  And the extra touches of welcome on my bed along with access to the living room with TV along with teas and other foods were a treat. I highly recommend this home. And the location was terrific for my run around Green Lake.  "
4026757,22711810,2014-11-12,13446411,Teresa,"Thoroughly enjoyed Roland and his hospitality. Great location, exceptional welcome. Hope to visit again soon."

4026757,23717820,2014-12-08,15943608,Jo,"Great room, friendly host.  Just beside a great park for running/going for a stroll. Short walk to shops/restaurants."
4026757,24655824,2015-01-01,22970606,Lana,"Roland is such a great host and made me feel very welcome by giving my sister and me chocolates and big bottles of water  on the bed when we first  arrived . He is very considerate  and understanding. The room itself (as advertised) is very clean, spacious  and well-decorated. The bed is so comfortable!!! Roland' s place is a perfect place to stay if you need to spend time in Seattle."
4026757,25574645,2015-01-19,163273,Tasneem,"The space is clean, quite, and cozy. The home is in a very pleasant neighborhood near a beautiful lake and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I’d happily recommend staying here. Roland is a friendly, generous, and thoughtful host. As someone new to the city, I appreciated his helpful suggestions. His pet cat is gentle and sure to make you smile. "
4026757,25703859,2015-01-23,4250196,Marie,"I loved to stay at Roland yellow Suite. The bed is huge (for European standards :)), extremely comfortable and with tones of pillows... And there was some chocolate and a bottle of water just waiting for me as a nice welcoming present.  
The house is very nice, welcoming, well designed and decorated, with all types of geek things (that i loved). There is no problem to park the car in the street in front of the house. The area is residential and very quiet.
But above all that, I had an amazing conversation with Roland. 
And he gave me tips too for visiting Seattle and traveling to Canada per emails with screenshot of googlemaps and else. It was very kind of him. I would recommend to anyone who wants to come to Seattle to sleep there and personally, it was my first experience to rent a room in an apartment (share apartment) and it was a great one! Thanks a lot Roland for all :)"
4026757,25983225,2015-01-31,17690682,Jennifer`,"Roland was a fantastic and very charming, helpful host! His home is very clean and relaxing in a great quiet nice neighborhood. My mom was visiting from Michigan and stayed in the comfortable Yellow Suite for a few nights. My mom is pretty old school and wasn't fully sold on the airbnb idea (in general) and Roland did everything to make her feel at home. By the end of the trip, she was pretty impressed. Roland has a great house and a very unique/sweet cat :) I highly recommend spending a few day/nights at this well-thought out home. If the weather is nice, take advantage of having your meals/coffee/reading out on the patio, really good vibes. 

Thank you again for everything, Roland! Great creative space, keep up the good work!"
4026757,26554359,2015-02-15,25404809,Kelsey,"I had such a great time staying at Roland's. His home was beautiful and was in a nice location to walk to the park, to restaurants, or to catch a bus downtown. I was traveling solo so it was great that there were other guests in the house to chat with and to go out with. Roland was a wonderful host and made me feel very welcomed. I would recommend his place to anyone! "
4026757,26625048,2015-02-16,26794347,Anne,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was beautiful, neighborhood nice, beds very comfortable, and Roland made us feel very much at home. I would definitely recommend staying with Roland if you have the chance!"
4026757,27063761,2015-02-24,27016741,Mandy,"Our stay was FANTASTIC.  Our room was exactly as described. The bed was huge and was like sleeping on clouds. The entire home was extremely clean (loved the chocolate and waterbottles on our pillows), beautifully decorated and very welcoming. The kitchen was thoroughly equipped and was easy to find everything needed. The bathrooms were squeaky clean and spa like! The location could not have been more perfect for getting anywhere in the Seattle area. It is also a few short blocks to quaint restaurants and grocery store. Don't miss Molly Moon's icecream!
Roland is an incredible host...very kind, compassionate and helpful... extremely personable too. We enjoyed great conversation.  I feel like my son and I stayed with an 'ol friend... not a stranger. 
We will be planning multiple trips back to the area for medical treatment and plan to stay with Roland whenever possible.
Thank you Roland! If you are ever in Atlanta our home is open to you! "
4026757,27295095,2015-03-01,20623950,Suzanne,From initial  contact to saying goodbye we were impressed.  Roland communicated wonderfully and the accommodations  were as presented online.  This home is beautiful and the location was perfect for us.
4026757,29633568,2015-04-10,798725,Gisela,"The Yellow Suite near Green Lake was a great place for me to stay while in Seattle on vacation and to visit with my daughter who lives in the area. The location is absolutely perfect, in walking distance to beautiful Green Lake and to many cafes and restaurants. The room itself is bright, beautifully furnished and very clean. The house is absolutely gorgeous, with a beautiful interior that is tastefully decorated, modern and functional at the same time. You are greeted by a charming, laid-back and funny host. Roland is great at making people feel welcome and comfortable at his house. Everything is perfect from the gatherings around the dinner table to the dark chocolate on your pillow. "
4026757,30567148,2015-04-24,5487609,Meg,"This felt like a ""home away from home"" and I felt very comfortable here. The yellow room was clean and attractive. I particularly liked the patio where I ate breakfast each morning and Roland provides coffee!  The location is just blocks from beautiful Green Lake which has a 3 mile bike/walking path around it. Roland is very amiable host. I would be happy to  stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. "
4026757,30831131,2015-04-27,30773655,Scarlett,"Nice and quite room, Roland really helpful, did not say bay officially, but hope to see Roland again"
4026757,31182619,2015-05-03,27016741,Mandy,"We reserved both the blue & yellow rooms for a week. It was our 2nd stay with Roland and we were just as thrilled as our first visit back in February.  Roland goes above and beyond to make sure his home is clean, comfortable and has all the necessary amenities.  The location is perfect to get anywhere in Seattle and it is walking distance to plenty of shops, eating and parks.  Roland quickly became a friend to our family and even joined us for my birthday dinner and came to visit our son in the hospital.  We are looking forward to two more trips in June that we have booked to stay with him.  "
4026757,31748608,2015-05-09,1535029,Dias,"The host is really nice and friendly. Really welcoming host and very easy to communicate with Roland. The home is really clean and quiet. The neighborhood is also safe and quiet as well. Location is great, easy access to I-5 and UW from this location. There are plenty of restaurants nearby."
4026757,32020713,2015-05-12,16397677,Matthew,"Roland's a thoughtful and communicative host, there were no issues whatsoever with my reservation process of my stay.  The house is terrific, in an ideal location, and contains excellent ""extras"" - on outdoor patio/seating area, two bathrooms, use of the kitchen if desired, and ample street parking.  I'd highly recommend Roland and his house for a stay in the Green Lake/Wallingford neighborhoods!"
4026757,32301310,2015-05-16,15222057,Kelsey,"Roland was an awesome host. We booked the day before we got to his place and his response was immediate. Upon arrival he greeted us and showed us around his beautiful home. It's almost set up like a hostel with all the amenities you need such as wifi, computer station, coffee, and even offered breakfast foods. The room we stayed in was very clean and had a ton of closet room for suitcases. And Jaspurrr his cat kept us company during the rainy nights! I would definitely stay at Roland's again it's in a beautiful area located by greenlake!"
4026757,32536461,2015-05-19,3097436,Mattie,"Welcoming host and atmosphere. Entire house is for guests who are staying there, three guest rooms total. We could come and go easily and could interact as much or as little with other guests and Roland as we pleased."

"
4026757,33486852,2015-05-28,21787606,Lani,"Roland was an absolutely gracious and accommodating host.   Our family had a need for an unexpected stay in Seattle on the morning of the same day we needed it.  Roland accepted the last minute request and kindly made arrangements for a late arrival.  The stay was for my daughter and her friend.  Roland's communications were excellent and the arrival was laid out as easy as could be.  The accommodations were excellent!  According to my daughter, there's nothing like falling into an inviting and comfortable bed after a day of stress and travel.  
The location of Roland's was perfect for easy access from I 5 and to the University Medical Center the next morning without being enmeshed in morning commute traffic.   Not to mention the immediate proximity to Woodland Park and the Zoo.  A big bonus, I'll plan to take advantage of next time I'm in the area, because I would gladly stay again.    Many thanks!!!"
4026757,33619619,2015-05-30,16790797,Summer,"super kind! super good host!

4026757,33866541,2015-06-01,15225477,Jonathan,"The location was good, very easy to get to Fremont. The house was very clean and comfortable and the bed was the best that I've ever stayed in AirBnB. 

Also, Roland was extremely welcoming and very kind. It was just one night, but we really enjoyed ourselves and we'd like to stay again there anytime."
4026757,34475791,2015-06-08,33937452,Jason,"Nice area in the Wallingford area.  The pin code door lock that allows us to enter and leave at ease. More importantly, Roland was a great host, provide a tour of the house, responsive and very welcoming."
4026757,35820503,2015-06-22,22404793,Anj,Great host! The place is abosultely beautiful and very comfortable. Enjoyed our stay in Seattle 
4026757,36003167,2015-06-24,27016741,Mandy,This was our 4th stay in the Yellow Suite at Roland's over the past 4 months.  It quickly became our home away from home while our son was undergoing surgery at Seattle Children's hospital as well as his post op visits.  Roland feels like family to us.  The room and home have continuously been extremely clean and comfortable with all the amenities we could ask for.  The location is also outstanding being convenient to anywhere you could want to go in the area.  I highly recommend booking one of the rooms at Roland's for your next Seattle stay.  
4026757,36787124,2015-07-01,14125198,Winnie,"Roland was extremely kind the first night we arrived. He gave us a detailed house tour and drove us around in town. Our room was extremely clean with plenty sunlight. The king size bed comforted us at the end of every long day. The bathrooms are perfectly clean. The kitchen was our favorite hang-out area. Roland's got amazing lounge music playing in the background all day long. Other guests in the house are always quiet and respectful. The neighborhood is highly walkable, also ideal for morning exercises. Roland himself has a super-cool personality and much fun to talk to. I can't thank Roland enough for making our fantastic trip more perfect!! He is the best!!"
4026757,37107975,2015-07-04,29653793,Ivy Lou,Roland was a super host and his beautifully restored Craftsman house in one of North Seattle's best neighborhoods had me very grateful to have booked with him for our first Airbnb experience.  We stayed in the Yellow Suite and although Seattle was experiencing a heat wave Roland did his best with extra fans to try and keep us cool.  He runs his place with warmth and consideration and was a perfect first Airbnb experience for us!
4026757,37242818,2015-07-05,23335777,Maud,"We did not get the chance to meet Roland in person but he made our late arrival very easy by letting us know the entry code. The room was very clean, comfortable and Roland had prepared kind attentions such as chocolate and bottles of water for us. The house is beautiful and bathroom is also very clean and has everything needed. Roland's house is also well located to go to Seattle downtown. All in all we highly recommend this place to stay in Seattle! "
4026757,37429205,2015-07-06,37345943,Dillon,"Everything was amazing. A great room, with a super accommodating host. Definitely book it if you're doubtful. "
4026757,37695135,2015-07-09,36243454,Brian,Roland was a great host and the room and accommodations were clean and exceeded my expectations.  I would book with Roland again.
4026757,37888007,2015-07-11,2022656,Joo,"I really enjoyed staying at Roland's house. It was truly home away from home. The house is nice and clean. The host: Roland & Jane, and other guest were very nice and easy going. The room is exactly as described, and the room faces back of the house, so it's very quiet. Location is also really convenient to go for run/walk around the green lake, zoo, and bus stop is only 5 minute walk to catch a bus to downtown. I would stay here again, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and comfortable place to stay."
4026757,37955086,2015-07-12,1015403,Cindy,"The home was lovely.  The neighborhood was beautiful!  Roland was attentive and very personable.  The room was spacious and immaculate!  Roland gave us a tour upon arrival and invited us to take advantage of the kitchen.   Coffee in the morning was a real treat as was the bottled water and chocolates we found when our bed was prepared.  

I would highly suggest a stay at Roldan's house to anyone!  It was a delightful experience.

"
4026757,38325148,2015-07-14,37033476,Sari,"Great room, new bed! Beautiful house and you can use it all.  Amazing neighborhood by Green Lake.  You can take walks around the lake and walk to many restaurants and coffee houses. Most importantly- great host. Roland went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable, shared his home and made sure all our needs were met.  Highly recommended!! "
4026757,38599801,2015-07-17,16599553,Marya,"Roland kindly met us when we arrived and gave us a tour of his beautiful house. He made us feel welcome to use the entire house and yard, which we happily did, and even invited us to his yoga class! Transportation worked out really well because there was plenty of parking on the street for our car plus room in Roland's garage for our bikes. Everything about our stay was comfortable and easy. Thank you for your awesome hospitality, Roland!"
4026757,38776424,2015-07-18,6759681,Jenna,"Roland made us feel very welcome during our one-night stay at his place. He greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour of the house and offered lots of helpful information about the area. Roland was quite hospitable and an all around friendly guy. Everything about the listing was exactly as described. The house was perfectly clean, organized, comfortable and located in a nice, safe neighborhood near Green Lake. The bedroom was perfect for us and the bottled water and chocolate next to the bed was a really nice touch."
4026757,40590093,2015-08-01,1579668,David,"Roland was an excellent host.  Upon arrival he gave me a tour of the house.  This was my first airbnb experience, and my two weeks here were most enjoyable.  The Yellow Suite is exactly as described, and having the use of the entire first floor as well (kitchen, bath, dining room, living room) was great.  Super-speed internet was a plus.   The quiet neighborhood near Green Lake was convenient to Seattle/King County's public transportation, which I used daily to visit many parts of the Puget Sound region by bus, rail and ferry.  I will definitely plan to stay here again on my next Seattle visit."
4026757,40763456,2015-08-02,36289965,Susan,Roland gave us a tour of beautiful home and made us feel welcome and comfortable. The neighborhood is delightful and convienent to green lake.
4026757,40957691,2015-08-03,28938000,Joseph (Jo),"Roland was great to deal with... I had trouble with booking on line and he went out of his way to stay connected and hold the spot for me.  He was there when we arrived to orient us and make us feel totally welcome in his heritage home in a GREAT neighbourhood of Seattle.  While he shares his home with you, he makes it feel like there is protected space for you as his guest, yet he is comfortable being in the space with you.  We had a very short time there, but I loved sitting on the porch with a glass of wine, thinking, you just don't get this feeling in a hotel.  Highly  recommended"
4026757,41402065,2015-08-07,6502198,Shereen,Roland was a great host and made my trip to Seattle a wonderful experience! The room and the house were just as described and located in a safe and convenient neighborhood. Roland was very helpful during my stay at his place and I would highly recommend his place!

Roland was a great host, even picking us up from the bus station even though we arrived late at night. The house was clean, comfortable and fun and it is in a really awesome neighborhood. There are good restaurants and places to stroll within walking distance and its a short drive to downtown Seattle. I highly recommend staying at this airbnb"
4026757,42937801,2015-08-16,39395156,Yaday,"Our stay at Roland's house was our best Airbnb experience. The house itself was beautiful, clean, and has everything you may need. The best way for us to describe Roland is as the most interesting man in the world, he has some pretty cool stories to share. Roland exceeded our expectations as a host. The location of the home is a short drive from downtown and right next to beautiful Green Lake. Jasper, his cat, will greet you upon your arrival. :) "
4026757,43064401,2015-08-17,10304857,Sydney,Wonderful stay at Rolands! We were only there over night after a friends wedding but loved his home! He was very easy to talk to and my husband and him ended up chatting for a while. Would definitely come back!
4026757,43455322,2015-08-19,41482065,Lynne,"Close to good restaurants, coffee shops, Green Lake. Pleasant neighborhood.
Access to well stocked kitchen, charming back yard."
4026757,44130250,2015-08-24,3759467,Laura,"Wow, what a lovely home! We really enjoyed staying in the Yellow Room. Roland is a super friendly, interesting and accommodating host. Our room was quiet and comfy, and we appreciated having access to the kitchen and living room during our brief stay. The location is really ideal if you're sightseeing in downtown Seattle. A nice, quiet neighborhood with lots of restaurants in walking distance. Definitely recommend. Thanks, Roland!"
4026757,44556885,2015-08-27,716830,Dana,"Lovely home in a gorgeous neighborhood a short drive from downtown. Great restaurants in the area, easy to park, and a nice sense of community with the other guests. We had an excellent stay!"
4026757,44732840,2015-08-28,1197207,Alicia,"I used AirBnB to host an out-of-town candidate for a job interview, and the candidate had a great experience with Roland. Thank you!"
4026757,44947160,2015-08-30,39513316,Tomomi,"The location was perfect as I really love to walk around Green Lake and Wallingford area. Roland is very kind and friendly host, and I felt very relaxed to stay at this yellow suite."
4026757,45162149,2015-08-31,16717910,Caroline,"Roland was a wonderful host, giving me a tour of his beautiful home and making me feel very comfortable. You can tell he is diligent and thorough with the little details he includes like lovely soaps and lotions in the bathrooms, chocolate and sparkling water on the bed and labels on everything in the kitchen so you know just where everything goes. 

I would recommend Roland’s home to anyone wanting to visit Seattle."
4026757,45348403,2015-09-01,425939,Adriaan,"Awesome time at Rowland's house, both with him and his other guests. Great conversations, great ideas, and a comfortable place to stay. Highly recommended."
4026757,46164564,2015-09-08,40442934,Vivian,Great first time Airbnb experience! 
4026757,46984031,2015-09-14,33214195,Anne,"Wonderful! Very relaxed and a beautiful home. Perrier and chocolate were on the pillow and later I had a long bath in the (gorgeous) master bathroom. 
There is also a lush, private backyard. 
The check in system is extremely easy and the host is friendly, happy to offer suggestions about anywhere in the city and there is free street parking. 

Excellent experience. I'd definitely return!"
4026757,47283884,2015-09-17,34653053,Jenny,"Our stay in Roland's house was great, we love the house very much, the area is beautiful. I would recommend Roland's house to anyone who wants to visiting Seattle!"
4026757,47448726,2015-09-18,4678500,Jane,"Roland was super welcoming, and the room was good. It was a very comfortable bed, clean and nice and quiet for a great sleep. I had a short overnight stay, and all was well. Love the neighborhood, so near good restaurants and a wonderful lake. I would stay here again!"
4026757,47659590,2015-09-21,25510192,Winnie,"After reading guest reviews and looking at the photos of the house, I was intrigued about my stay.  I felt welcomed, safe and relaxed while there and so enjoyed my walks along the lake and in the neighborhood.  I've always enjoyed Seattle, however this stay was the best as I felt part of the community instead of a tourist.  There's a culture at each Airbnb and there's no mistake that this one is an opportunity for interesting conversations and comfortable living.  I will definitely return and recommend to my friends."
4026757,47806947,2015-09-21,43382953,Margaret,"This was a terrific AirBnB in a perfect location -- out of the congestion of downtown, but easy striking distance from it if that's where you're heading. It's in a great walkable neighborhood close to great eats, drinks, shopping, exercise, any anything else you might want. Roland and James made me feel terrifically welcome. The place is beautiful, homey, quiet, and easy to find, and my only regret was that I didn't have five more days to spend there. There's no doubt where I'll be staying the next time I need to overnight in Seattle."
4026757,48358926,2015-09-25,39394307,Florian,"Its a great house with Garden in a beautifully Setting. Roland is a Great Host. Its been a pleasure.

4026757,48817791,2015-09-28,15444268,Alina,"Had a great stay at this airbnb!  The host is very welcoming and accommodating.  The description is accurate as are the photos.  It was tidy, there was bottled water and chocolates waiting for us on the night stand (always a nice touch!) and a cute kitty to greet us at the door.  We didn't hear any of the other guests staying at the house and no street noise.  If you're looking for a quiet place this one is good for that.  Loads of clean fresh towels available for you to use and extra blankets and overall very comfortable.  I'd go back there for my next visit. "
4026757,49404391,2015-10-03,16964281,New,"The place was nice, and close enough to the highway to get around.  The only issue was that there was a cat, which although friendly, made a lot of noise, even at night."
4026757,49696104,2015-10-05,25272252,Jan,"Since Roland was out of town, he arranged for James to greet us.  James was very welcoming and pleasant.  The room was exactly as pictured:  lovely, clean, and comfortable.  The house was the same.   The location is top notch, within walking distance of Green Lake and good restaurants.  We will definitely return to Roland's house.  "
4026757,53228181,2015-11-06,45114688,Ralph,Extremely nice welcome - loved the low key introduction about the essential. The house and room are perfectly adjusted for guests.
4026757,53538907,2015-11-09,47598332,Bronwyn,This was my first Airbnb experience! Roland was very welcoming. The accommodation was lovely and clean and very comfortable. Nice bathroom with lots of clean towels. It's a great neighbourhood with many good dining options. I will be back for next years regatta at Green lake! Thanks Roland it was a wonderful stay!

4026757,55144267,2015-11-28,48635186,Jianmin Wei,"第一次Airbnb体验,非常好。房间干净舒适，设备齐全。房子在一个刚刚好的位置，步行五分钟就能到格林湖，周围都是西雅图老社区老市民，典型美国社区居住环境。公共交通非常便捷，有44路去华盛顿大学，去市中心有16路直达westlake station，到了downtown那周围就是派克市场，海边轮渡，太空针等等景点。唯一的缺点是卫生间公用，卧室内没有卫生间。总的来说，是个很好的选择，一次愉快成功的Airbnb体验。谢谢Roland和James!"
4026757,55479489,2015-12-01,12938936,Jenna,Stayed multiple consecutive days. Booked separately. See previous review :)

4026757,56690808,2015-12-16,11776801,Eriko,"I moved to the Yellow room from the Green room, extending my stay.
The Yellow room was in the back of the house. Both of the rooms were comfortable. Roland and James are both great hosts, being responsive  
and attentive to respond to questions and needs of guests.
Hope they are keeping up the quality service as they expand their operation."
4026757,58102753,2015-12-31,52430302,David,"When I first got to the listing, the room was ready even a bit before check-in that was fantastic.  Roland let me in and James gave me a tour of the place. This was my first Airbnb and the accommodations and amenities where even more than I was expecting.  The room was clean and looks even better than the photos, heck they even left some fancy chocolate in there.   If you're here just to get to know the city or visiting this place is in a great location.  Walking distance to bus stop (and even an UberHop drop-off.  The hosts were great guys and really made you feel at ease, even if you're travelling on your own.  If all Airbnb's are this good I know I won't be going to a hotel anytime soon.   "
4184211,22800612,2014-11-15,6321210,Alex,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at Jordan's apartment for a long weekend in Seattle and we loved it. Her apartment is beautiful, very comfortable and we felt very well taken care of during our stay (clean towels; clean, bright room; toiletries; cozy bed and two bathrobes!). The bedroom offers a lot of privacy (even while Jordan was home) and we felt right at home the second we walked in the door. Jordan is a great host: she was always easy to reach, very accommodating to our travel schedule and made sure we were enjoying our stay throughout the weekend. It almost felt like we were visiting a new friend instead of renting a room in her apartment. The location is perfect for anyone visiting Seattle – very central to Capitol Hill and the wonderful spots it has to offer, and the neighborhood felt very safe. We will absolutely be back."
4184211,27192981,2015-02-27,28350080,Jessica,"This was my very first experience with Airbnb and I was very apprehensive about it because I was traveling alone but I couldn't have picked a better place or person to have as a host. 
Jordan was so welcoming and kind! I was so grateful for her kindness and hospitality. And her home was absolutely stunning! It was in close proximity to all the cool things in Seattle, everything was seriously within walking distance. I truly felt like I made a friend and that she wasn't just a host. Oh and her instagram page was full of cool ideas to do. 
I couldn't have asked for a better first experience. 
"
4184211,28640101,2015-03-27,3049820,Judy,"We stayed at Jordan's house during a road trip. Even though it was really last minute, Jordan responded instantly making the trip to Seattle possible. We arrived late but Jordan provided clear instructions on how to check in, and was very flexible and helpful. The apartment is located in an exciting neighbourhood, and the bedroom and bathroom were clean and tidy. I would definitely stay with Jordan again when I visit Seattle! "
4184211,29759528,2015-04-12,3664295,Jonathan & Margi,Jordan's place was great.  We appreciated that it was clean and in such a great location.  Highly recommended.
4184211,30012962,2015-04-16,22641556,Alyssa,"I never had the chance to meet Jordan in person, but she did everything she possibly could have to make me feel welcome. She was so readily and easily available via text or email. She left a welcome sheet, instructions, answers to common questions, and even some local Seattle goodies for me to enjoy. The apartment itself was GORGEOUS. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay. Clean, impeccably designed, and centrally located - this place was a great find. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and was sad to leave. "

4184211,30720820,2015-04-26,18818540,Michelle,"Jordan was great (and so was her place!)!  She left out wine and tea/coffee for us, and had bathrobes, shampoo/conditioner, and towels in our room.  She was very kind to let us drop off bags before official check-in time so we could explore the city.  The apartment itself has a great, home-y feel, and is walkable to great food, nightlife, and city sights.  "
4184211,34805260,2015-06-12,17381432,Cole,"Rad space, rad host. We loved meeting Jordan and enjoyed her friendly hospitality. Loved that her place is within walking distance of fabulous restaurants, bars, and shopping. It's also readily accessible to public transit. The hotel-quality linens and towels are a super nice touch! Oh and her place is GORGEOUS and very clean. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4184211,35399097,2015-06-18,1406339,Ruth,"Jordan's apartment on Capitol Hill is Seattle's best kept secret, until now! It's the perfect location, she is the ultimate host and her place is what I always dreamed a hotel would be like. It's absolutely hands down the best airbnb experience you will ever have."

4184211,36419449,2015-06-28,34512542,Kelli,"Jordan was an awesome host! Our fight got in very early and she was kind enough to let us drop off our bags and chill out a bit before exploring the city. Jordan made sure we always had everything we needed and were comfortable. We never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome while staying with Jordan. 
The location was fantastic - 30 minute walk to Pike Place market and blocks away from some great restaurants. 
We had an absolutely wonderful visit. Thanks Jordan! "
4184211,39288146,2015-07-22,34684059,Yasamin,"My boyfriend and I had a great visit! Jordan's house is lovely. The room was serene and there is plenty of room to hang out in the apartment. The location is great and central, about a 10 minute walk to the Pike/Pine corridor where there are a ton of shops and restaurants. We were able to check in early and Jordon was very nice, inviting, and gave great recs. Her Instagram account gave us a lot of great ideas and made us feel at home in the city. Thanks, Jordan! "
4184211,40201242,2015-07-29,4231714,Oliver,"We had a brilliant time in Seattle and we couldn't have asked for a better host than Jordan. The flat was immaculate, beautifully decorated and we were made to feel very welcome. We loved the area and enjoyed coffee, breakfast, drinks and dinner locally while we were there. The flat is well located for exploring the city. Would highly recommend! And redbone do exploring Capitol Hill, a great area."
4184211,41341672,2015-08-07,17921968,Danielle,"Jordan is a Rockstar host! She is super sweet, easy going, and such a joy to stay with. Our interaction with her was limited, but it was great when we had the chance to visit. Her space is decorated like a magazine and our room was super clean and comfortable. Id love to stay with her again in the future!"
4184211,41931206,2015-08-10,8939691,Myranda,"We're do we start to describe the warm and bright and funny personality of Jordan? She made the apartment like home for us. The wine and coffee, the lovely linen on the bed, the soap, the conversations, the art, everything was in harmony and worked together in this lovely place. The neighborhood is great, the apartment tasteful, the host so warm and helpful. Go and see yourself. And of course the communication and description were perfect."

4184211,45391454,2015-09-02,38088264,Natalie Storm,"Our stay at Jordan's home was so perfect!! She has the prettiest home in the center, nice and neat and she's a very welcoming and warm person!! Definitely recommend this place if you're in Seattle!!"
4184211,46507495,2015-09-11,34224549,R.T.,"Clean, quiet and comfortable - just as promised.  Just a short walk to the best cappuccino and porchetta sandwich we've had since Rome! Great hostess.   "
4184211,47481875,2015-09-19,6867343,Cameron,"Jordan was a great host. Warm, welcoming, and helpful. I was sort on time, but if I had more I would have loved to share a meal with her. And yes that living room and bedroom are very comfy. "
4184211,48279176,2015-09-25,38152974,Erica,"We absolutely loved our stay with Jordan. She was so friendly and laid back and she offered up a few great suggestions on where to eat. This was our first experience with Airbnb and I think we are now spoiled. 

Jordan is definitely skilled at feeling out her guests personalities. She took the time to engage with us a bit when we were all just hanging out around the house but gave us our space at the same time. I loved hearing about her background and a little bit about her life in Seattle.

The bedroom was on the small side but it was clean and fresh, cozy and it was enough for us since we were out and about most of the day. There was also space to sit in her living room if we wanted to lounge.

I have to say that during my trip I fell in love.  Jordan was cat sitting an adorable Himalayan cat named Taki and I was smitten. Really, I felt so sad when our trip ended and I had to say goodbye. Since we love cats we were totally thrilled to have Taki to cuddle with us, but Jordan was also very considerate to email me before we arrived to tell us she had the cat and that if we weren't cat people she would keep her locked in her bedroom. 

Jordan did have a parking pass that we could use so we could park nearby but parking was a little hard to find at times. Also a little tip- one of the parking signs had graffiti on it so we couldn't read it and we ended up getting a ticket. However, this was in no way Jordan's fault. Just a heads up to very carefully try to look at the parking signs. 

From the house you can walk 15-20 minutes to Volunteer Park, and about 30 or so to Pike Place Market. We love to walk and explore the cities we visit so this was great. "
4184211,48640245,2015-09-27,255833,Jim,"Jordan's home was very comfortable, conveniently located, and well decorated. She is walking distance to several restaurants and bars as well coffee shops. There is parking nearby and she provides a pass. The bed was very clean and extremely comfortable with a down comforter.Jordan was easy to contact and helpful with recommendations. Would certainly stay again."

Your place was wonderful -- you could tell it has been meticulously rehabbed with great style and comfort in mind.  The neighborhood is quaint for walks and walkable to everything Fremont has to offer.  I appreciated your attention to anything we needed to make sure we had a great stay.  Thank you!  I would to love to stay at your place again next time I'm in Seattle."
2989758,13888854,2014-06-07,6354983,Jared,Great house!  Thanks to Desdemona for opening up her home to me.
2989758,14048327,2014-06-10,3127363,Sean,"Desdemona is a fantastic host! We unfortunately did not get to meet her during our stay, but she has done an amazing job of making her space accessible. Her home is lovely and she made sure that we were welcome and that we enjoyed our time in Seattle. I cannot recommend her space enough! "
2989758,14362962,2014-06-17,15837167,Marcie,"Very clean, modern and comfortable home in a happening part of Seattle.  Easy walkability to shops, restaurants and farmers market but being off the main drag, it was very quiet and a nice retreat.  Desdemona is a wonderful host and takes great care of her place - absolutely spotless when we arrived.  A perfect spot for visitors to Seattle to base themselves out of. "
2989758,14618540,2014-06-23,10591000,Michael,We had a great stay here with our family.  The house is a great location with great restaurants within a block of the house.  Thanks!
2989758,14917045,2014-06-29,15741590,Keith,Desdemonas place is just as described. Great location and great house.  Throughly enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back!
2989758,15102393,2014-07-02,7156802,Valerie,"This is a lovely home in a great neighborhood - wonderful kitchen, main bed is very comfortable, nice living and dining room, very clean. Desdemona gave us clear and timely instructions. Though she was not in town she had a friend available to help if needed, but we did not need anything. I would definitely recommend and hope to stay again in the future."
2989758,15264353,2014-07-06,1984272,Jaime,"It was really easy to communicate with Desdemona while booking her place and her response time was quick. Her place was large enough to accommodate my family of 4 with enough sleeping and eating space. We had a short 2 night stay, so her recommendation of going to Paseo's for dinner was excellent. Her home in the Upper Fremont area is really close to the Woodland Park Zoo (just a 10 minute walk), so we took our 7 and 4 year old there for a day. Although we weren't too happy about having to clean up upon our arrival (sweep kitchen floors, dust bathroom vanity, wash bathtub), this is a good place. "
2989758,15830993,2014-07-16,7127133,Assal,"We really enjoyed our stay at Desdemona's beautiful house. The house is very clean, nicely decorated with plenty of space. It is located in a great neighborhood with many restaurants and cafés nearby. We highly recommend it."
2989758,16552659,2014-07-29,15978526,Jordan,"Desdemona's home was a wonderful ""home base"" when my college friend and I went to Seattle for a wedding. It was clean and very comfortable with modern conveniences and was just as advertised. Great kitchen! This house is in the perfect location - so much within walking distance! Our host was out of town when we were there and her communication before and throughout our stay was very good. "
2989758,16669384,2014-07-31,715361,Debra,"A lovely, comfortable home in a fantastic neighborhood. Huge kitchen, clean and comfy bedrooms. Just great all around!"
2989758,17095182,2014-08-07,15780681,Myeong,"Fast, reliable and friendly! Made my family's stay a breeze. Thank you!"
2989758,17931437,2014-08-19,15776880,Meg,"Desdemona has a great house. It's centrally located making quick trips to downtown (7 mins drive) or day trips outside the city a breeze.  There's very easy access to a coffee shop (3 blocks), multiple restaurants (2-4 blocks) grocery shopping at a small market or organic shopping less than a mile away, two gas stations (5 blocks), the zoo (8-10 blocks).  Also Green Lake park is a very short drive (about 5 mins) and offers a great playground, boat/paddle board/paddle boat rental, swimming, exercise trails, tennis courts, splash pad/wading pool, etc.  

Our family of 4 stayed in her home for 11 days and were beyond pleased with the neighborhood.  This was our first trip to Seattle so we were nervous about booking a house in an area in which we were unfamiliar.  Desdemona offered open communication throughout  the booking and rental processes and definitely eased our concerns before the trip.  

The house is very comfortable with ample living area. The  floor plan worked great for our family, although the bathroom is quite small.   The house was very orderly and fairly clean, but the kitchen floors could've used a good mopping. I would've liked to have either ceiling fans or more oscillating fans since we like it cold when we sleep and this house (like most in the PNW) has no AC.  We were there in Aug and some days the temp neared 90 degrees. On those days the house didn't really cool down until around 1 AM.

The kitchen is awesome and well-equipped, however we would've liked a traditional coffee pot instead of a press.  The towels and linens were ample and very clean. The couch is comfortable and there's plenty of seating in the kitchen and dining room. The television is TINY and there's no cable or DVD player, so don't plan on relaxing in front of the television.  She does have an Apple TV, so if you have Netflix, Hulu, etc. you're in luck.  If you're like us, you'll be so busy exploring all the amazing things Seattle has to offer that you'll hardly notice.  

Overall, we had an amazing trip.  We would certainly stay in her home again of we travel back to Seattle!"
2989758,18173076,2014-08-23,17010862,Gregor,"Two of my friends and I stayed in Desdemona's lovely Craftsman home on our Seattle visit in August as an affordable alternative to a hotel.

The house is located in the relaxed neighbourhood of Fremont and met all our requirements and more. It comfortably slept three adults with each of us having a separate bed (one bedroom, two sofa beds), a huge kitchen with lots of appliances should you want to cook, and a spacious living room and dining room.

Shops, bars and restaurants were a 10-15 minute walk down the hill from the house, as well as many local Fremont attractions like the Fremont Troll, Lenin statue, brewery, chocolate factory and vintage mall.

Downtown Seattle was only a 15-20 minute taxi ride (around $20) to see various tourist attractions like the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pike Place market and the Aquarium.

As a host Desdemona was excellent. Before we arrived she had emailed all the house info and rules and explained every little detail. We didn't need to contact her once except to ask about where to go drinking in Fremont (Brouwer's Cafe - best select of beer ever!) :p

I would recommend Desdemona's Craftsman home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
2989758,18725759,2014-08-31,18124121,JiHee,The space was large and clean. Very accommodating with plenty of sleeping space. The key pad for entry was a little tricky. The owner was quick to respond. The location was close to Paseo and bus stops. 
2989758,19103839,2014-09-06,20306461,Doug,"The house was great, very comfortable, sunny, and spacious.  Ideal location for that part of town"
2989758,19215075,2014-09-08,19810703,Linnea,"Desdemona's home was so cozy and comfortable. We loved the decorating and the large kitchen. Her detailed information prior to our arrival made our stay very convenient. We loved the neighborhood with a quick walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and bars."
2989758,19617836,2014-09-15,3117270,Joey,Desdemona provided great information ahead of time. The house was spotless and exactly as pictured. 
2989758,26321594,2015-02-09,6341614,Maria,"Desdemona's craftsman home was very comfortable for us. It is in a very quite street, but yet close to restaurants and cafes. Communication went smooth with Desdemona. We surely recommend her place."
2989758,26738492,2015-02-18,25407066,Tania,"The experience was fantastic. No problems, great neighborhood, close to good restaurants and bus stops. We stayed for 7 days and did not have any issues. "
2989758,26982073,2015-02-23,25477594,Michael,"3 day trip to Seattle for 3 adult friends was enhanced greatly with this wonderful, warm home in Fremont district.  The house was exactly as described and then some.  Our hosts' home was clean, well appointed with guest staples, and sleeping comfort for our ease of use.   Plenty of room to relax when we were not out site seeing.  

The ease of use for this home was really welcomed.  Our host provided straight forward and concise directions to the home features which allowed us to get situated without hitch.  It was enjoyable to immerse ourselves in the neighborhood which has a quaint, old school, eclectic feel.  1.5 block stroll to Fremont Ave which has grown nicely in dining options, sundries and boutique shops. We had free parking on the streets at all times. 

Seattle proper is 4.5 miles ( about 12 minutes ride via 99 or the 5) which we traveled to daily.  From the home there were views of the snow capped Olympic range and Mt Rainer. Really glad we did not try to book a hotel downtown.  

Loved it.  Will come back again.  Thanks for helping make out trip a great success.

The house was a short drive to Ballard, Green Lake, Phinney Ridge and Wallingford. This was our first Airbnb experience and we were extremely pleased."

The house was nice and easy to access. I can speak for my whole ground when I say we enjoyed our experience at desdemonas house."

2989758,31304768,2015-05-04,5666411,Laura,"Just had a wonderful sisters weekend staying at Desdemona's.  Incredibly easy check in,  beautifully and thoughtfully designed home, super clean with everything we needed,  fantastic walkable locale.  Loved her artistic touches throughout the home including her furniture, really added to the character that was already present in the structure of the home.  We're all into the arts so we loved these artsy touches.  Beautiful well stocked kitchen which we used for breakfasts and a light din one night.  She was so generous in leaving all her dinner and flatware and condiments for our use.  Lighthouse Roasters and Paseos (yum) just a short walk away.  Plenty of bedding and blankets/sheets/towels etc and even extra hairdryers and shampoos, lotions, soaps, etc.   Felt so at home!!!   So glad we booked this place. 
Thank you so much Desdemona.  We'll be back next year:)

Within walking distance to local cafes and coffee shops.  Also near transportation to downtown.   Everything you described and more.  Beautiful kitchen, bath  and very comfortable bed.
Thank you,  Mary and Jim Mcinerney"
2989758,33271296,2015-05-26,19633670,Theresa,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Desdemona's house.  The house itself was cozy and tastefully simple.  It was very spacious and would be accommodating to larger parties with its downstairs basement as sleeping quarters. For those seeking to tour around Seattle, the location was perfect due to its close proximity to Capitol Hill and the Downtown area. 

Desdemona.  You can not ask for a better host.  She was very quick to respond to our inquiries and provided precise and useful information for the duration of our stay.  Her accommodations truly allowed us to feel a sense of home.  Thank you for letting us reside at you home for the weekend!"
2989758,34013347,2015-06-03,33084423,Rick,"It's a sweet little house with plenty of room to spread out. Exceptionally clean and decorated. We felt very much at home there.

Our stay there couldn't have been easier. Thanks Desdemona!"

2989758,34540664,2015-06-09,31873014,Anthony,"We really liked staying here.  There were four of us staying, and we had a lot more room than we expected.  The kitchen is great, and the location is convenient for exploring.  It was easy to walk places, or a quick Uber if we were too lazy for the hills.  I would rent this place again."
2989758,34752757,2015-06-11,7389567,Timo,"Everything worked perfectly during our two-night stay in the house.  The kitchen had everything we needed, and the space was good for cooking and eating.

We really felt like being at home. "
2989758,35449281,2015-06-19,27800199,Cameron,"We had a wonderful time at Desdemona's home. It was spotless and lovely. 
As we were in town for a graduation and didn't know if other family members would make it until the last minute, having the extra sleeping options was awesome. 
We found everything we needed and communication to and from Desdemona was excellent. She gave great instructions on how to access the home, and seemed to be a text away if anything was needed. Comfortable, clean and well-appointed from kitchen to bath.
As a side note, her tips on the local businesses were spot on. It was great to be able to walk a couple blocks to coffee or huevos rancheros, or to the little grocery store nearby for picnic supplies. "
2989758,35776055,2015-06-22,29353221,John,As advertised!  Perfect location for Solstice weekend.  Everything is within walking distance or a short Uber ride.  Desdemona's house is immaculately clean and very comfortable.

2989758,36924687,2015-07-02,27860961,Kim,"We were in town on business and stayed two nights. Desdemona was very accommodating and always responded right away via email when I had questions. Her kitchen was pretty well stocked, including condiments and drinks in the fridge. The temperature outside was higher than normal so there were two fans in the bedroom to help keep us cool at night. The house is in a quiet neighborhood with it's own parking space."

We didn't run across any problems with the place or communicating with her. We actually extended our reservation for 1 day and she made the nearly impossible, possible for us! We literally had no issues and would recommend this place hands down!"

There is a great coffee place around the corner and a fantastic neighborhood store up the street. Desdemona was a great host. She responded promptly to our emails and was very accommodating. Given the opportunity, we would definitely stay here again. "
2989758,39262742,2015-07-22,12566131,Spencer,Desdemona's house is in a great location.   Very close to downtown and Fremont which  has lots of local shops .  The house is clean and in a nice quiet neighborhood.
2989758,39574142,2015-07-24,10379827,Prashant,"Des was very responsive host and available to solve any problems that arise. Unfortunately, there were too many problems that I encountered during the stay making this an unpleasant trips compared to other airbnb hosts this year.  Had to make the bed by myself and towel/shower supplies was not as clean as compared to other stays. Hosts are very sloppy and not up to airbnb standards. "
2989758,47810275,2015-09-21,29478227,Matthew,"We loved this house. It felt spacious  and clean with a ton of windows. The bathroom was very nice and stylish. Though we didn't cook during our stay,  the kitchen was large and well suited for preparing  a meal. We would highly  recommend this place."

Many of the bars and restaurants in Fremont are in walking distance.  The others are a short Uber away.  Would definitely stay there again."

2472850,13091319,2014-05-19,14371328,Kevin,"As a first time airbnb user, I had my reservations about using this service. Communication with Teagen quickly put my fears to rest as she was very polite and prompt in answering any questions or concerns that I had.  The apartment was located conveniently in the hills above Seattle, and several amenities were provided. Would highly recommend to anybody looking to stay in Seattle!"
2472850,13424895,2014-05-27,9178368,Hazel,"Teagen was a great host and was quick to respond to my questions. The space was nice and perfect for three people. Very easy walk to downtown, Space Needle, EMP etc.  However, there are a few things that are not included in the description- it is quite loud with a very busy road just below the building. If you are a light sleeper, I recommend ear plugs. Also, there is no view of the lake now that there is a large building being built in front of the deck."
2472850,13728635,2014-06-02,2832731,Michael,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2472850,13800078,2014-06-04,15179424,Nataly,Teagen was an excellent host. She responded very quickly to any questions and offered up anything in her home and fridge. Her condo is in a great location for first timers to Seattle. Walking distance to Seattle Center and Space Needle with excellent restaurants and bars close by. Walking distance to Monorail which takes you right to Pike Place Market.
2472850,14808534,2014-06-26,2478272,Alejandra,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2472850,14917771,2014-06-29,11792421,David,"We had a very nice stay in Teagan's apartment. She was very responsive and easy to work with through out our stay. The apartment was clean and located with easy access to Seattle Center as well as Lake Union. There were some great local restaurants (pizza, breakfast, mexican) as well as easy access to supermarkets. One thing we wish we knew ahead of time is that the apartment is located very close to a major (and very noisy) highway. We had trouble keeping the windows open due to the noise, but there was only one floor fan to circulate the air in the apartment.  "
2472850,15425617,2014-07-08,12167913,Inna,"The apartment was nice and conveniently located. However, the posting has to be updated because the view is now blocked by the new building construction. Apartment has definitely tons of natural lighting, but the noise and dust from the construction site and freeway did not allow us to enjoy the fresh air in the patio. We were also unprepared to the street parking which was obviously hard to find, especially if you return late at night like us. Besides that everything else was pretty much as we expected. "
2472850,15533376,2014-07-11,206203,Amanda,Teagen is a responsive accommodating host and check in and out was easy.. There was an air conditioning unit and a fan when we stayed that really helped keep the place cool during a couple of very hot Seattle days. The place has a great TV and surround sound system we enjoyed. It is nicely furnished and had a comfortable bed. It is located next to Aurora Avenue and is quite loud with traffic noise so earplugs are advised.
2472850,15886018,2014-07-17,1922890,Steven,Teagen's place was completely as shown and was awesome. Location was great and was in the heart of Queen Anne. Would totally recommend anyone to stay.
2472850,16200139,2014-07-23,13860438,Pavel,"First off I'd like to stress how great Teagen was as a host. She answered all inquiries promptly and addressed any concerns. Check in and out was a breeze due to excellent communication. We even found ourselves in an unfortunate situation where we locked the keys in the apartment and Teagen was able to unlock the door and get the keys for us before we even came back!

As for the apartment itself, it was also amazing! It was just as it appeared in the pictures, if not better! The neighborhood was great as well, centrally located, very beautiful and with lots of nice restaurants nearby.

Overall I would have to say that it has been an amazing experience staying at Teagan's place and I would wholeheartedly recommend staying there on your next trip to Seattle!"
2472850,16566874,2014-07-29,1158975,Marianne,"Great place to stay, the condo has everything you would need and is exactly as pictured. Teagen was a great and prompt communicator throughout the entire process and the whole experience was smooth from start to finish. As some other guests have mentioned, I, too, would recommend ear plugs at night if you are sensitive to traffic noise as it can get pretty loud around morning rush hour. The location is otherwise great; super safe neighborhood and there is a bus stop just a 1-2 minute walk away taking you straight into Belltown/Downtown. Belltown, the Space Center and the Queen Anne shops/restaurants are all within 10-20 minute walk. Great host, great place!"
2472850,17761712,2014-08-17,4379684,HyoJung,The place worked great for us. It was as pictured in the photos.

It is on the first floor, with the entrance outside the locked part of the building, small but nicely furnished, and quite noisy from traffic on a major street bordering the coplex, although leaving the fan on at night created a white noise effect such that it wasn't an issue.  The pros:  The location is great -- walking distance to the Seattle Center and several restaurants, even downtown if you're a bit ambitious -- and the neighborhood seems safe.  Furniture is comfortable.  Kitchen fairly well-equiped.  Air conditioning was welcome on warm days, although in order to install it, the host used a piece of hard plastic in place of the window, contributing to the noise issue.  Parking was not a big issue once we discovered you can park down some steps on the next street over if nothing else is available. Price is very reasonable.  The cons: the big thing was that the condo, while very neat, was not as clean as it should be -- dirty dishes in dishwasher, hair and dirt on toilet porcelain and in tub, towels left in dryer; several other little things -- no instructions on how to use TV system, no DVD player, no information left regarding public transportation in the area or nearby restaurants, markets, coffee, etc.; and communication from host could have been better in general re: location of unit and keys and parking.

Her place was very accurate in regards to the photos posted online, and the neighborhood was so sweet. Adorable cafe's/eateries nearby, and all within walking distance. If it weren't for her place, we definitely wouldn't have had the experience we did in Seattle... Highly recommended! "
2472850,19108015,2014-09-06,20815635,Michelle,"This was a wonderful experience.  Not only was everything as it was described, but she was very accommodating. Really helpful and responsive! In a nice neighborhood with close by places to eat or late night activities. Close to downtown Seattle! I highly recommend staying here to anyone! "
2472850,19789076,2014-09-18,20639885,Anna,"We have had a nice staying at the appartment. All was very clean and pretty new. We had free wifi and reached the downtown by bus in just 20 minutes. We recommend to everyone!! 
Furthermore, I have talked with the owner when I had any question."
2472850,20436676,2014-09-29,322608,Alexandra,"Great location! Walking distance from public transportation, grocery store, restaurants and Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum) "
2472850,21648875,2014-10-20,3108985,Jen,The reservation was canceled 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2472850,22110641,2014-10-30,22085785,Jazzmen,"I did not meet Teagen during check in, but she provided all the information I needed. She was very responsive to emails, Airbnb messages and texts in the weeks and days leading up to my visit. 

The condo is as listed and depicted in the photos. The proximity to public transportation allowed me to begin exploring the city within a few hours of arriving from the airport. 

Teagen's home is a quick walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden and Glass. I didn't rent a car, so I relied primarily on the monorail and bus system, which are both a short walk from the condo. 

It rained once when I stayed in Seattle, but luckily the condo had a great entertainment system and TV; I was able to entertain myself until the rain subsided. 

In addition to the close proximity to public transportation, 
the condo is located near great eateries, such as Crow and Citizen. "
2472850,25602472,2015-01-20,25133585,Agnes,"Great up front communications with our host and hostess.
The Condo was exactly as described, it was roomy, clean, and ready for us. 
Good TVs.
Great to have cable access
Teagan provided a number of restaurant suggestions which we used and appreciated.
This condo can be a little noisy as it is  adjacent to a major road; however,  this condo is in a great location with easy access to public transportation, walking distance to many and varied (Mexican, Italian, Breakfast, Crowe, and Metterrean) restaurants, the Space needle, and the Monorail.
We felt completely safe walking this neighborhood in the evening and night.
If you are going to Seattle consider this neighborhood and this Condo for easy access to downtown Seattle.
This was our first Airbnb experience and it will not be our last."
2472850,28315584,2015-03-22,27442137,Christina,Teagan was friendly and really accommodating . Thanks for letting me stay.
2472850,35085890,2015-06-15,28776047,Gina,"I booked Teagen's condo in April for 2 nights in June to attend a wedding in Seattle.  I found Teagen slow to respond to requests for information until the week before the wedding.  It's hard to tell from the map but the condo is right on Hwy 99, Aurora Blvd.  The traffic noise from 99 was really loud.  I had to sleep with my ear buds in, listening to ocean waves white noise to fall asleep the second night.  The condo is cute and the living area is as pictured.  On a scale of 1 - 5, I'd give cleanliness a 3.  The bed in the bedroom was comfortable.  My son and girlfriend slept on the air mattress provided.  On the second day we tried to turn on the TVs but couldn't get either one to work.  I texted Teagen for instructions but she never responded.  I suggest they leave detailed instructions for guests. Overall, I'd say this condo is overpriced due to traffic noise and cleanliness."
2472850,35970224,2015-06-23,22702138,Beebe,Teagen was awesome throughout the trip! She was welcoming and sent messages prior to arrival that made us feel like we picked the right spot to stay. She was easy to get ahold of via phone. The place was exactly as described and very spacious for two people. 
2472850,36322713,2015-06-27,16441926,Janet,I appreciated that this apt. is so close to my daughter's apt. in Queen Anne.  The air conditioning was very welcoming and the place was nice and neat with a very comfortable bed.
2472850,38514702,2015-07-16,28524562,Janna,"Teagans condo was in a great location for my husband and I. Just two blocks from the bus stop and about four from the grocery store. Perfect amount of space for 2-3 people.  The bed and bath are not pictured, however, they are roomy as well and a small balcony with a bbq that was great to sit and have coffee. Several good restaurants in the neighborhood to try. If you shop at the QFC make sure to get a rewards card (I left mine there for others) but your groceries will be a lot cheaper. The condo is equipped with everything you need. The highway is right below the condo but we had no problems with noise. Enjoyed our stay we would highly recommend this condo to others. "
2472850,38733892,2015-07-18,6589590,Allison,"The place was as described and parking was easy. We didn't mind the street noise, but did have to sleep with the window closed. When we got there there was no toilet paper, but Teagen was responsive and dropped it off. Maybe it was a miscommunication with the cleaners, as Teagen hadn't been there between guests, but the trash was full and the sheets were dirty. Washer and drier were helpful after a week of traveling!"
2472850,40779938,2015-08-02,36674079,Zack,"The house was accurately described, though slightly smaller than I imagined it would be. Teagen was very helpful with directions and descriptions of the house. The house was clean and presentable. "
