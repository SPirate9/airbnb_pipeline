53867,1579359,2012-06-28,922704,Krysta,"Kevin and Jennfer's cottage is a lovely place to stay.

The university district is quite a way from the Seattle city center, but with own transportation that was no issue at all. Very close to the Washington university village for shopping/groceries/eating.

Steep driveway and ladder to the loft make it a bit harder for the less agile/mobile but we had no troubles with either."
53867,1611087,2012-07-02,2447273,Jennifer,"Kevin and Jennifer were great hosts - easy to communicate with and very friendly. The cottage is adorable and extremely clean with ample space. It's a little far from downtown and other neighborhoods, but with a car that wasn't a problem. I would absolultely stay here again if I come back to seattle. The was my first time using airbnb and I hope all my future experiences are similar. "
53867,1644167,2012-07-06,2514384,James,"My friend and I stayed for a couple of nights at this amazing cottage. Here are our thoughts:
1) Location: This cottage is located only about 10 minutes away from downtown (by car) so it was quite convenient (if you have a vehicle).
2) Parking: There was ample parking space! For free too!
3) Amenities: Everything you see in the photos on their website are as shown. The upstairs room was a neat element of the cottage (as you have to access it by way of the ladder. It is very sturdy though! =) Clean towels. internet access. They have an extra air mattress which we used. They also have cable TV, and many books on things to see/do in seattle.
4) Safety: Very peaceful and quiet in the neighborhood. Felt very safe.
5) Hospitality. We never got to see Kevin/Jennifer but they laid out pretty good instructions as to how to get there. No concerns whatsoever.

We would highly recommend this place for anyone going to seattle. We can't really comment on public transportation as we never took it, but it was certainly worth the money spent there! Thanks Kevin/Jennifer!"
53867,1666256,2012-07-09,2590048,Zay,Beautiful neighborhood and well laid out cottage! Hot water on demand was a plus too. We really enjoyed our stay and the price was great!
53867,1695992,2012-07-13,2345540,Khiem,"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Kevin and Jennifer's cottage. The cottage was clean and cosy and we had everything we needed for our stay. Though you have to climb a steep staircase to get to the bedroom. Unfortunately Kevin and Jennifer were away during so we didn't get to talk to them. Checkin and checkout was easy, and the bus to downtown was just outside, and drove approx. every half hour."
53867,1723597,2012-07-16,2784640,Kevin,Place was clean and very quiet. Enjoyed our time in Seattle!
53867,1756404,2012-07-20,2872857,Dennis,"We visited Seattle in mid-July 2012.  We stayed in the McCollums' guest cottage for three nights.

It was a perfect space for our family (two adults and two children, age 6 and 8).  The home is in a nice residential neighborhood in Seattle easily accessible to I-5 and the downtown areas.  

Everything was as shown on AirBNB.  We enjoyed having use of a kitchen for a breakfast and dinner.

The hosts were friendly and accommodating!  We would recommend the house."
53867,1768340,2012-07-22,1976022,Sage,"Very nice clean little cottage in a pretty backyard. Chickens in the yard (don't worry, they're quiet) which are fun to watch. It's a little north of the University, but easy to get to with a short walk or on the bus. Our hosts were very nice."
53867,1793322,2012-07-24,1379194,Robert,Great clean little cottage. Helpful instructions and communication by Kevin and Jennifer. We would definitely stay there again! 
53867,1827913,2012-07-29,2580709,Lee,We loved the coziness and convenience of the McCollum Cottage. Thanks for a great visit!
53867,1930488,2012-08-09,130230,Maya,"Das Cottage ist ideal in einem schönen Vorort von Seattle gelegen. Ein tolles Frühstücksdiner nur ein paar Häuser entfernt. Die Gastgeber sind sehr auf unsere Wünsche eingegangen, alles war sauber und die Kommunikation hat sehr gut geklappt."
53867,1992751,2012-08-15,2622553,Jamie,"We had a wonderful stay at the so very charming backyard cottage and loft. It was very central to Seattle, easy to get places, clean and comfortable. We are sorry to have not been able to meet our hosts, as they were away. Also, the ladder up to the loft was easy to use. We did have a rental car, but there was lots of access to public transportation. The lovely sound of the chickens was a sweet way to wake up every morning. We would recommend this as a wonderful place to stay, and would definitely come back if we visit Seattle in the future. "
53867,2014178,2012-08-17,435062,Scott,"Kevin & Jennifer were such kind and accommodating hosts. We really enjoyed the cottage, it was just as described! Reasonable price too. Can't wait to come back. Thanks guys!"
53867,2071010,2012-08-23,2213636,Lucyna,"Together with two small kids we have stayed at the cottage house for 5 days. It is very very very comfortable place. We have rest so much after long journey from Europe to the USA. 
We have recommend that place online so I hope some other Polish people will choose that place in Seattle."
53867,2212305,2012-09-05,3437245,Joshua,"We really enjoyed our time at the U District backyard cottage. It is a beautiful space, a great location, and it was really nice to be able to make a quick breakfast or a cup of tea. It was easy and comfortable all the way through. I would stay with Kevin and Jennifer again in a second.  "
53867,2239330,2012-09-09,176507,Joe,The McCollum's have a great place.  It is a great location; clean and quiet.  I enjoyed my stay in their guest house!
53867,2265919,2012-09-11,3350510,Lisa,"This was my first experience with airbnb, as well as, staying in someone's home whom I have never met. And I am happy to say our ""Backyard Cottage"" experience through airbnb was great! Kevin and Jennifer were friendly, accomodating, and professional. We enjoyed visiting with Jennifer and Sean in the backyard.
The whole booking process was simple through airbnb, and the directions/instructions provided by Kevin and Jennifer were helpful,  detailed and easy to follow. Location of the Backyard Cottage was perfect - easy to get to and from, no matter where we were, and set in a quiet neighborhood. The cottage itself was very nice, comfortable, and clean! We would definitely recommend staying at the Backyard Cottage and would love to do so again! "
53867,2426647,2012-09-27,2908848,Curt & Michele,"My wife and I were in Seattle to visit our son & we stayed at the cottage for a week. The accommodations were terrific and exactly as described on Airbnb. The Sunflour Cafe is a couple blocks away and the bus stop is less than a block away. The cottage is situated in a very nice quiet neighborhood. It was great to have Wi-Fi available so we could return at the end of the day and plan for the next day. The walk to the UW campus or U Village is a pretty good hike, but we did it just to say we could. It was amusing to wake up with the chickens in the morning, but they're really not very loud. The booking/check-in process was very easy, and the price makes this an excellent value for your dollar. We would stay again at the cottage in a heartbeat. I hope it is available for our next trip to Seattle."
53867,2600027,2012-10-13,188826,Ed,"Very nice set up in this ""cottage"".  Great location near the University.
Jennifer was very accommodating in providing an air mattress for extra sleeping area, and also very prompt in replacing the current air mattress when it was discovered that a small leak had developed.  "
53867,2620495,2012-10-15,3713240,Melanie,"Kevin and Jennifer's loft was a pleasure to stay in. Though we did not meet them, we had no problem with access or keys.  The loft was in immaculate condition, private and very nicely decorated. There was a well-stocked book shelf that included novels, coffee table books and Seattle tour guides. I believe there was also a DVD player and Wii video game console. I don't enjoy going down ladders, but I plucked up my courage and had no problem with this one. It was a nice feature. 
The loft is located about a 20-30 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle, and right on a main bus route, with no transfers required, so commuting without a car was easy. I look forward to staying here again."
53867,2696134,2012-10-23,2808857,Conny,"the cottage is coveniently  located near  the house our son lives in while going to (website hidden) was nice and cozy as the temperatures had dropped and we loved the quiet neighbourhood and chickens in the back
yard.The cafe around the corner is perfect and we will absolutely stay again when visiting Seattle next year."
53867,2739946,2012-10-28,1324445,Susan,"The place is exactly as others have described - nicely appointed with everything that one needs to have a home away from home.  We did transit downtown and enjoyed the experience.  There's a Whole Foods a car ride, bus ride or long walk away.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
"
53867,2786879,2012-11-02,3515581,Jillian,"Clean and lovely. For us, we wished we had done a bit more research to understand the location relative to where we needed to get around in Seattle. I could see this being an ideal location for visitors with a car. That said, bus access is around the corner and a completely comfortable place to relax in. I agree with previous visitors that the Sunflower Cafe is a great place to visit! "
53867,2810935,2012-11-05,793671,Briana,"This was my second time staying at Kevin and Jennifer's backyard cottage, and it was just as delightful as the first about a year ago. Private, comfy bed, nice features, great sound system, lots of fun books to look through (if you have the time, which unfortunately, I didn't...), this place rocks. Glad to have found them!"
53867,2864939,2012-11-12,3676331,Dixie,Great place to stay!  
53867,2897618,2012-11-16,188826,Ed,2nd time staying .. great spot
53867,2935715,2012-11-21,3821329,Sherry,It was a great experience staying in the backyard cottage. we felt like home and had a wonderful time!!!
53867,2998113,2012-11-30,2170246,Tamsen,"This was a perfect little spot for me while in Seattle.  It's in the Roosevelt/Ravenna area, and not far from the 520, I-5, or UW.  Easy to find.  The living space had everything I needed, from throw blankets to a great sound system.  Even a wine cooler.  Kitchen is tiny but eh, I only needed the basics.  The sleeping area is up a ladder, but the ladder has plenty of handholds and is very sturdy.  There were ample towels and other supplies, and everything was very clean.  I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Seattle area who doesn't mind being away from downtown.

The only ding was that the high tech high efficiency water heater did not work at first, which was really not great.  But the owners fixed it during the day while I was at the office so I am not taking a star away.  These things happen, and they took care of it."
53867,3027008,2012-12-04,821939,Mona,"Kevin and Jennifer have a well maintained property.  Really easy to get to and neighborhood is really cute and I felt very safe.

I had a couple of issues but Jennifer and Kevin were both prompt to respond to help me with the hot water situation/lack there of and they said they would replace the hot water heater."
53867,3064469,2012-12-11,3377742,Doug,"I stayed in three airbnb locations in Seattle and liked this one the best.  The quiet cottage provided complete privacy in a sleakly designed setting.  The climb into the loft was an enjoyable experience, as if I was climbing up to dream.  The softly clucking hens were a welcome as I came in and out.  They have a wall unit water heater in the bathroom and on one day it ceased providing hot water fairly quickly.  If later discovered that I simply needed to turn the water and restart it for the hot water to resume.  This is more of a family oriented area although it is easily accessible to the University District and Ravenna Park."
53867,3123792,2012-12-20,3976467,Patrick,"The cottage was great and looked exactly as advertised! The place was very clean and had more than everything you need. Very easy to get to by car and not far from downtown. The ladder access loft was a different experience and quite enjoyable.  Overall, a great place to stay and I would love to stay again next time I am in town. "
53867,3190493,2012-12-30,4411118,Thomas,"We had a great stay at Kevin and Jennifer's cottage.  It was an excellent base for a couple days of exploring Seattle.  Close to the zoo, which our daughter enjoyed."
53867,3210475,2013-01-01,787248,Janice,"I dread writing negative reviews, but Kevin's Cottage surely was not pleasant. I should have read the other reviewers below me knowing the hot water heater was still a problem not fixed. When the hot water depleted and I was showering in the ice cold water in the middle of the cold winter night, I proceeded to email him notifying the situation the following morning. He left me with some instructions, but Kevin did not offer to come over to help fix it or even a mere apology in the email. The hot water system at the cottage is a luxury if you are lucky enough to catch the supply of it. The check in is firm at exactly 4pm, so if you wish to come sooner, the answer is NO. Even when no one is expected to check in after you the same day, you also should not hope to extend your stay past 12pm noon when you wish to tidy up his cottage before you exit.  "
53867,3272393,2013-01-04,4535256,Jeff,"A very restful apartment that felt like home!  Very quite neighborhood and a very short drive to downtown Seattle.  If you're looking for a comfy place to relax while in the Seattle area, this is the one!  "
53867,3447147,2013-01-31,537807,Arianna,"We were SUPER pleased with the experience we had at Kevin & Jennifer's cottage. They were very helpful when it came to answering whatever questions we had in a very swift, professional manner. We loved the location and really loved having chickens as our neighbors. Truly a beautiful space, we hope to be back soon!"
53867,3596973,2013-02-20,40203,Andrew,"We had a great stay! Kevin and Jennifer were especially accommodating for us on short notice and made check-in/out a breeze. The cottage was easy to get to, well maintained (no problems with the water heater) and full of thoughtful details (down to heated floor tiles). Highly recommended."
53867,3671498,2013-03-02,5118764,Nancy,"Great stay at Jennifer and Kevin's cottage. They were friendly and very responsive to requests - including loaning us their coffee grinder! The cottage has just enough kitchen and is pretty well-equipped, the bathroom has lovely tile work and great on-demand hot water, and the living area is open, light, and well furnished. The hens in the backyard coop make it oh-so-Seattle! I wasn't crazy about the loft ladder - creaky kneed and vertically challenged as I am - although the bedroom it leads to is airy and roomy, and my husband was completely unfazed by it. I enjoyed several lovely conversations with Jennifer. Great crab cake breakfast at the restaurant 2 block uphill, too. Highly recommend a stay with the McCollums."
53867,3703862,2013-03-05,5153869,Patti,"We really enjoyed our stay!  Jennifer was very friendly and took the time to explain the ins and outs of the cottage.  Quiet neighborhood, conveniently located near U District, near fun shops and restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle!"
53867,3739646,2013-03-10,4660996,Carlos,"Staying here was a blast!  I didn't get the opportunity to meet Kevin but I did meet Jennifer and she was an awesome host. She gave me a quick rundown of everything in the cottage and some suggestions in the area. Jennifer even went as far as providing us with a pair of umbrellas when we went to go see Morrisey at the Moore Theatre.

The cottage was amazing, perfect for me and my girlfriend to stay in. At first the ladder up to the bedroom seemed awkward but eventually learned to like it. Everything was clean and taken care of. The cottage had its own kitchen, hot water,  a TV, and books to read, what else could you ask for?

The location is about 15-20 minutes away from Downtown and the airport in car (we rented a car). It was extremely convenient to stay in the area because of the location, the bus ran through too just in case for those of you that were wondering. 

Be sure to visit the Sunflour Cafe (turned into Bryants Corner or something like that recently), the breakfast there is great! Its about a 2 block walk from the cottage.

Overall an absolute pleasure to stay in and will definitely stay there again if I were to be given the opportunity to do so."
53867,3942695,2013-03-29,5415278,Josh Boyd,"Wonderful experience, great location, highly recommended."
53867,3965811,2013-03-31,1746717,Gregory,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. It's really a small detached apartment. The small kitchen was a real plus, so I could shop at the nearby Whole Foods and not spend a lot at restaurants. I was there for a conference at the UW, which was a very nice 30+ minute walk through the beautiful Ravenna neighborhood. The place is clean, private, quiet and comfortable. The weather was warm while I was there, so I did not try out the heated floor. They do warn you that the bedroom is in a loft accessed by a ladder, so if you have any issues with climbing this place is not for you. The loft is really a separate room with a door that covers the hatch, so someone can be up down below without disturbing someone sleeping. The place was easy to get to and parking was available. I love to walk, and the surrounding area is very walkable (provided you are okay with some hills). I would definitely stay again if I have the opportunity. Thanks!"
53867,4136285,2013-04-13,5008344,Ben,"The cottage was clean, modern, and warm, and a very quick bus ride away from UW.  Kevin and Jennifer were responsive when I emailed them during my stay.  Plenty of street parking.  I wish it had been cold enough to turn on the heated tile floor."
53867,4207209,2013-04-18,2230731,Diane,"As the cottage has been amply reviewed, I would like to share what a great host, Jennifer is!  She was most accommodating, very gracious, and a genuinely caring woman.  She was helpful in every way and full of great info.  Super experience!!
"
53867,4388054,2013-05-02,423381,Lynne,"This was my second stay at this cottage in Seattle and I hope to return in the near future.  Great location, quiet, clean, convenient and a good neighborhood.  "
53867,4456458,2013-05-06,3620411,David,"The back-yard cottage was very comfortable.  The location was perfect for us, and we had a wonderful 3-day stay.  The slight inconvenience of the ladder up to the upstairs bedroom was really not a problem at all.  Jennifer was a very warm & welcoming hostess, and we would have enjoyed spending more time together had that been possible.
We unreservedly recommend the McCollum cottage!"
53867,4496042,2013-05-08,5901197,Eki,"Beautiful cottage in a lovely neighborhood!  As we walked up we were greeted by Kevin and his neighbor.  This was my first airBnB experience so I was initially nervous, but everything turned out very well. The cottage amenities were wonderful and the loft bed very cozy.  There's also a neat bookstore within walking area. Being close to a downtown bus route was very helpful. Thank you Kevin and Jennifer!"
53867,4730779,2013-05-22,5883148,Kamill,"We are moving to Seattle and this location was great for our home search. Kevin and Jennifer were a great help. The actual apartment was clean, well organized and comfortable. Heat and hot water works perfectly. No problem finding off-street parking. Location within easy walking distance of restaurants and public transportation."
53867,4874876,2013-05-30,5742763,Gabrielle,"Great place to stay, easy access to the city and no problems with access to on street parking. We rented a car, about 25 min from the airport and 5-10 to downtown depending on where you are going. Very clean and quiet, lovely neighborhood. "
53867,4965486,2013-06-04,5942386,Chelsea,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was just perfect!  The cottage is cozy and well stocked with anything you might need (umbrellas, corkscrew, shampoo, etc.).  We loved having access to the backyard for our toddler to run around, and Kevin and Jen even invited us to have a beer with them around the bonfire on our first night.  The neighborhood is close-in and easy to navigate, and parking wasn't an issue at all.  Whole Foods is close by, but there's also a co-op called PCC Naturals right up the street on 40th.  We really appreciated having a home-base while we were visiting Seattle - we can't imagine staying in a hotel ever again!  "
53867,5023697,2013-06-08,5300420,Mathew,"Great place. Quiet, clean, and very comfortable. Highly recommended. "
53867,5098074,2013-06-12,2908848,Curt & Michele,"This was our second stop at the Kevin & Jennifer's cottage, and once again we had a very nice stay. We weren't around much during the daytime, but it was great to have a nice quiet place to come back to in the evenings. Wi-Fi works well and there was plenty of hot water. I'm sure we'll be back again."
53867,5240653,2013-06-20,5354724,Susan,"The cottage was clean, neat and very nice. It had enough room to spread out and plenty of shelf space. The area is good and had access to transportation so travel was easy. The cottage is private and we really enjoyed our stay.  Would definitely stay there again."
53867,5304043,2013-06-23,6966231,Christopher,My wife and I were up in Seattle and stayed in the U district cottage.  I was in the area on business and my wife was on a mini-vacation.  This was a perfect centralized location while I was working and was perfectly quiet for my wife for a little R&R.  The unit was clean and was equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Due to our busy schedule we did not see much of Kevin & Jennifer but enjoyed our stay none the less.  We were very happy with our stay!
53867,5382368,2013-06-27,6500190,Edward,We enjoyed our stay at your place.  A nice space and in great shape.  Thnaks
53867,5425414,2013-06-29,7099222,Chelsey,"Great location. Close to Ballard, Fremont, and in the U District. Very cute neighborhood. "
53867,5484416,2013-07-02,1971733,Caroline,"Loved it, loved it!  We're Seattlites too, and had rented out our house via aribnb.  Then my husband, Paul, decided he wanted to swim the Open Swim Greenlake Race so we needed a place to stay for a couple of nights - Kevin and Jennifer's place was perfect for us.  We arrived at 4:40pm, after a super hot, five-hour drive from Spokane.  The simplicity and tastefulness of the cottage was really lovely and the location was perfect: a couple of miles from Greenlake and even closer to Top Pot Donuts, among other nice restaurants and amenities.  Having the chickens in the yard to watch was an added bonus.  Would stay there again, without a doubt.  Thanks!"
53867,5525679,2013-07-04,2994664,Rachel Rose,"Kevin & Jennifer were excellent hosts (though I was unable to meet them during my stay). I was there for three days to tour places to live, so I wasn't in the cottage for anything more than sleeping, but it was still a very comfortable place to stay. It did get a little toasty, but one of their friends brought us fans and it made all the difference. It took me a few times to get used to going up and down the ladder, but I thought it was fine. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area for a few days. "
53867,5580490,2013-07-07,6433624,Luke,"This place rocks! My girlfriend and I did not want to leave. 
The location was perfect for our Seattle vacation. We enjoyed the clean, spacious, quiet, and  private comfort of this accommodation. Although we did not have occasion to personally interact with our hosts during our 3-night July stay, their online communication was consistently quick, polite, clear, and welcoming. The hosts made it easy to feel at home. Kevin and Jennifer have excellent taste. The cottage was basically impeccable: tidy, attractive, and thoughtfully furnished. After long days of driving, busing, ferrying, and walking the city, my girlfriend and I looked forward to our opportunity to relax and have fun in the comfort of this place. I can say with confidence that our time in Seattle represents the best vacation we have ever experienced, and this cottage was a significant catalyst for our enjoyment of the city."
53867,5693853,2013-07-12,851189,Grace,"We had an amazing time! The cottage was beautiful, clean, and cozy. Jennifer and Kevin made sure we had everything we needed to be self-contained (including a fully functional kitchen with a toaster oven, a stove/oven, fridge, microwave, dishes, utensils, etc.). Our son loved watching the chickens in the coop every morning. Parking was easy. The neighbors were friendly. Our hosts were kind, respectful, and just delightful. We're looking forward to going back and would recommend this cottage to any respectful guests looking for a peaceful retreat. Also, the cottage is in a great location, close to some very cool shops, restaurants, and Whole Foods. "
53867,5750900,2013-07-15,149028,Adrienne,"The cottage loft is really cozy and clean. The loft ladder is probably not for someone who isn't adept as you have to step to the side to get up in the loft. Otherwise, it was a nice quiet stay, with everything you need."
53867,6214951,2013-08-04,3552582,Loretta,Wonderful stay. The upstairs room is fun and cozy. Thanks!
53867,6363669,2013-08-10,451156,Susan,"Great location, roomy yet cozy cottage, complete with friendly chickens in a nearby coop who are excellent company!  I interacted several times with Kevin throughout my stay, and he was warm, generous, helpful, and flexible. Good access to local buses, which was a great help also during my stay."
53867,6511968,2013-08-15,7232321,Jess,"We had a little trouble finding this place in the dark, but once we did we were very happy. It was fantastic having a kitchen after two weeks of eating out and the cupboard was stocked with staple foods for our use. The cottage is neat, clean and well kept and Kevin and Jennifer were lovely, welcoming hosts. We'd definitely stay again!"
53867,6654133,2013-08-20,243602,Gil,Great communication. Great location. Awesome cottage! Couldn't have picked a better place to stay!
53867,6709971,2013-08-22,7305733,David,"Loved staying at the cottage, it was super comfortable and perfect for our stay.  Well appointed kitchenette, comfy bed, cute street.  "
53867,6766944,2013-08-24,7779273,Laurent,The cottage was absolutely great! We really enjoyed it to stay there and Jennifer was a very gentle and friendly host. The location is quiet and a good place to relax. You can reach downtown easily by bus (there is a station right around the corner). We definetly would have stayed longer if we had had time and we highly recommend this place!
53867,6870332,2013-08-28,7375148,Amanda,"In a single word, I can only describe the McCullom loft as...perfect.  It was a perfect location, perfect accommodations, and perfect hosts.  I had a perfect time, and hope to stay there again.  Thanks for everything!"
53867,7100753,2013-09-06,5772835,Nishil,Kevin and Jennifer's place was great! It was super clean and had everything we needed. Definitely recommend staying here to anyone who wants to visit Seattle!

53867,7744537,2013-10-01,8237106,Frida,"Had a great stay! :)
Despite the storm outside the cottage was very clean and cosy. Plenty of hot water as well in the shower. Very near to bus stop for bus to Seattle.
Kevin & Jennifer were very friendly and accommodating.
Can highly recommend this place :)
"
53867,7838191,2013-10-05,594768,Anne,"What can I say?  The minute I walked in, I was so happy to be here.  I appreciated the great design: high beamed ceilings, cozy and efficient bath and kitchen.  Great place.  Very comfortable bed up a well-designed ladder, which was really more like steps.  Enjoyed saying hi to the chickens.  Hosts accommodating.  Loved the free parking in front of their house too."
53867,8048043,2013-10-14,3909100,Jana,The cottage was just as advertised - lovely! The location was perfect for us since we were there for a college football game. There are lots of cute local restaurants and parks around. Would definitely stay again!
53867,8259172,2013-10-22,2164146,Jimmy,"We had a wonderful stay in this spacious backyard cottage in Seattle. It was about a 10 min. drive to downtown, and very close to University of Washington. Great restaurants nearby as well. We enjoyed our stay."
53867,8360786,2013-10-27,1684198,Eric,"Quiet, cozy cottage, exactly as described! Enjoyed my stay, and briefly met Jennifer on my way out who was very friendly and accommodating.  Definitely recommend! "
53867,8485090,2013-11-02,7209453,Phil,"Very clean, attractive and well appointed.  We loved the chicken coop and enjoyed watching them from the kitchen window."
53867,8592461,2013-11-06,561169,Tim,We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was a very comfortable and private stay. We loved the neighborhood feel that was provided and would recommend the place for some fun loving visitors to Seattle. The cottage was clean and well appointed also.Thanks Jennifer for the extra towels!
53867,8745917,2013-11-15,9841063,Janet,"As former Seattlelites, we selected this cottage primarily for its location as it allowed us easy access to Greenlake, Ravenna Park, friends' homes and favorite restaurants.  The cottage was clean and well appointed.   We didn't get a chance to personally interact with Kevin and Jennifer during our stay but they were quickly responsive to our request for an early check in.  We also enjoyed watching the chickens!"
53867,8822352,2013-11-19,1654033,Ryan,"This is a clean, cosy place in a solid location. There is good access to several north Seattle neighborhoods along low traffic routes. The landscaping and chickens in the yard give the place some pastoral charm. The radiant floor heating feels good against your feet. Kevin and Jennifer are certainly good at respecting your privacy, making it a great place to go and carry out your business."
53867,8873712,2013-11-23,9840603,Christi,"Perfect space for me on my last visit to Seattle. I love interesting spaces and this fit the bill! I especially loved the loft bedroom that was cozy and warm with a very comfy bed. The heated floor were also lovely. On top of that, it was spotlessly clean and very quiet. Thanks for the great stay!"
53867,8903462,2013-11-25,336565,Jim,Another perfect stay. Great neighbourhood and the backyard cottage has everything needed for comfort and convenience. Highly recommended!
53867,9019397,2013-12-02,423381,Lynne,"As with previous trips, I enjoyed my stay in the backyard bungalow.  Location is very convenient (my sons live close by) and the neighborhood is very nice.  Thanks for a great stay!"
53867,9181201,2013-12-11,10371255,Qingyuan (Mike),This is the first time to use Airbnb. The experience is wonderful. Kevin and Jennifer are very kind people. The communication is very easy and the feedback is very quick. There are a lot of maps and leaflets on Seattle and State which are very useful for us. The cottage is very well and the facilities are well maintained. The floor heating is very good to keep the cottage warm during the winter. The bed is comfortable and very quiet during the night. The kitchen has everything we need and the oven is very useful to roast the nuts we bought from the shop. The location is perfect for us. The main purpose of our trip is to see our daughter who is studying in U of Washington. It just take about 25 min. to UW. We also love the Ravenna Park which only about 15 min by walk. The public transportation is very convenient so that we even do not need to rent a car. It only takes 27 min to downtown and 60 min to Airport by bus and light link. The Safeway is only 10 min walk and one organic food market is very close. It takes 18 min to University Village by walk. The neighborhood is very safe and people are very friendly.  We feel at home. Thanks Kevin and Jennifer. Also thanks   Airbnb. We will stay this cottage again in future and will recommend this to our friends.  
53867,9295039,2013-12-19,10371255,Qingyuan (Mike),It is a great home!
53867,9353303,2013-12-23,1338990,Lisa,Very nice and cozy place; wonderful appointments; spacious and comfortable. Recommended!
53867,9497362,2013-12-31,10162856,Andy,"This place is absolutely wonderful in every way. My wife and I stayed here for a couple nights and were so happy with the cottage. The hosts made everything so easy for us. They have a kitchen that's prepared for everything, a living room that was perfect to enjoy a cozy night in with a movie, free wifi, and the coolest loft sleeping area with an extra comfy bed. It was so clean and cozy. Just keep in mind that you have to climb a ladder to get to the loft. That wasn't a problem for us at all. It's a 15 minute drive to just about anywhere in Seattle and has a wonderful breakfast spot around the corner. We couldn't recommend this spot enough and will definitely be staying there again."
53867,9646254,2014-01-04,9968550,Susan,"We loved our visit  everything was super  clean ,comfortable and very thoughtfully arranged . Will look forward to staying again in this charming , well appointed private guest house.

53867,10299951,2014-02-11,3083754,Julien And Jason,"We really enjoyed our stay! The bed's comfy, the living room's great to snuggle and watch a movie when it snows, the heated floor's a gem, and the chicken neighbours are amusing. The cottage is very quiet and well kept. "
53867,10478578,2014-02-21,11069386,Valerie,"This was perfect for my family of 3. Cute, clean and comfortable. It is in a great neighborhood and has a kitchen so you can cook and feel at home. I loved this cottage and would highly recommend staying here. The host made this visit perfect! Thanks again Jennifer and Kevin!"

53867,10662428,2014-03-02,3640670,Danusha,"     This is a very sweet backyard cottage in a lovely neighborhood, close to restaurants and Whole Foods. The living room has a peek of mountain views and gorgeous sunsets. We enjoyed having a place outside of the hubbub of downtown, yet only ten or so minutes away (checking for traffic!). We did a lot of our own cooking, here, which was a plus. The fridge was unpredictable at first, so I'd check about that if you plan to stock up on groceries. Kevin helped straighten it out, immediately.We enjoyed the chickens!"
53867,10733854,2014-03-04,5019561,Shareen,Kevin and Jennifer are great!  The cottage was perfect. Everything that I need was there. I loved the setting and it was so quiet. Thanks for the accommodations and excellent hospitality! 
53867,11037013,2014-03-17,13009009,Eric,"The cottage was exactly as designed. It is a wonderful, quaint little place to stay, and was perfect for my wife and I on our honeymoon. It is within a very close driving distance of the major sights of Seattle, but far enough away to be quiet and relaxing. I would definitely recommend Kevin and Jennifer's cottage to anyone!"
53867,11102350,2014-03-20,13077155,Susan,Comfortable and convenient place to stay. Parking was always available. Loved the loft! 
53867,11143733,2014-03-22,7402289,Leia,Thank you so much for a great stay!  Everything worked out very smoothly.  Cheers
53867,11218790,2014-03-25,8402155,Ray,"Kevin & Jennifer provided a very clean, quiet and comfy space for our 3-night stay in Ravenna/U.D. To our delight, the place was very quiet despite being within a few paces of a major bus line. The friendly chickens in the backyard (thankfully, no roosters) were an added charm. The full kitchen, comfy living room (sofas, stereo, TV, etc.) and superb Wi-fi make the Cottage an excellent base for Seattle stays."
53867,11289043,2014-03-28,12339340,Larissa,"Great area of Seattle, close car ride to everything we wanted to do. Listing was just as described...wonderful! Super comfy bed in the loft, we slept great! The kids loved checking out the chickens in the yard!"
53867,11369218,2014-03-31,13079687,Heather,"Staying at this cottage was a great experience--it was exactly as described and just what I was looking for. It was quiet and cozy and within walking distance of grocery stores and many restaurants, as well as the University of Washington. The bus stop is just steps away. The bed is very comfy and it's handy to have a little kitchen. I would definitely stay here again!"
53867,11558338,2014-04-07,13416423,Brian,What a beautiful home! The little cottage was fantastic and incredibly clean and well kept. Parking was easy and the home had all of the amenities needed to feel comfortable. It was a joy to stay here and I would highly suggest booking!
53867,12112973,2014-04-23,11706247,Lori,"This cottage was perfect!  It was bright, super clean, and in such a wonderful area!  Parking was never an issue always right outside the house!
We did not get a chance to meet our hosts but we did get a glimpse of their adorable little boy feeding the chickens!  We had numbers to reach them if we needed anything.  We felt like we were at home and were able to come and go as we pleased.  
We are hoping to visit again and certainly hope McCollum Cottage is available!
Thank you so much for helping to make this a wonderful ""homecoming"" for our daughter.  
Sincerely, Jim, Lori and Sam Giglio"
53867,12197943,2014-04-25,4881884,Colin,The backyard cottage was a great spot to stay in Seattle as an alternative to staying downtown.  I was working on Capital Hill and the place was super close to everything.  Kevin and Jennifer provided great instructions and communication on where to find it and all the amenities that the cottage offered.  It was absolutely spotless inside and cozy.  The bed upstairs (up the ladder in the loft) was very comfortable.  Thanks for everything!
53867,12657190,2014-05-07,13024097,Meredith,"Beautiful location and wonderful little house! Being right on the bus line made it very easy for us to get around all week. The house had everything we needed to call it home for a week, and we enjoyed all the magazines on Seattle and the other books they have on the shelves! If we weren't moving to Seattle in a month, we would definitely stay here again! "
53867,13103898,2014-05-19,8780870,Lynne,This cottage was exactly as described & we found it to be very comfortable. The location was convenient & we didn't have trouble parking. I would recommend McCollum cottage to anyone gaol enough to negotiate the ladder stairs to the loft
53867,13216173,2014-05-22,14334753,Tiffany,"The cottage was exactly like we expected (including the ladder to the lofted bedroom)! We loved the neighborhood, parking instructions were clear, and the cottage had EVERYTHING we needed and more! Kevin and Jennifer were also available if we needed anything. Our visit was very short since we were doing a tour of the Pacific Northwest, but we would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. It was a delightful first Airbnb experience! :) 

Oh, and the bed is super comfortable! Maybe it was because I was tired from traveling and hiking... But! That. Bed. Was. Awesome. (And totally worth the climb up the ladder!)"
53867,13348609,2014-05-26,13189283,Matt,"The cottage was cozy and very clean. The kitchen was very functional and convenient, the layout worked perfectly. The neighborhood was great, walking distance to many amenities including a nice little bakery and an amazing park. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely do it again!"
53867,14338454,2014-06-17,5300420,Mathew,My family and I stayed with Kevin and Jennifer over UW Graduation weekend and I couldn't have worked out better. The place was very comfortable for my mother and grandmother. Parking was a breeze and getting to and from campus very smooth. I've stayed in the cottage several times and highly recommend it. 
53867,14446559,2014-06-19,2267039,Cynthia Matthews,"The neighborhood was was safe, quiet, and wonderful for walking, and relatively close to restaurants and shops. We had a car, so we did not use public transportation. The hosts promptly replied to any requests, but we did not really have any other interaction with them. Although the apartment was clean and worked well for three, it is small, and probably best for no more than two agile (for climbing to the loft) people."
53867,14600078,2014-06-23,7900588,Emma,"We absolutely loved our stay in Kevin & Jennifer's cottage! They were very friendly hosts, and the cottage was beautiful and well equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay (we especially appreciated the amenities like shampoo, conditioner, and tea). The neighborhood was lovely and relaxing—definitely a great place to spend a sunny weekend in Seattle. "
53867,14754735,2014-06-25,16620304,Melissa,We found the Cottage clean and quiet. We couldn't have asked for more. We were able to walk down to the PCC for groceries and had a wonderful breakfast at Bryant's Corner a few blocks away. Overall we had a great time! 
53867,14989533,2014-06-30,16593016,Hillary,"Great gem of place for a weekend stay in Seattle!  And, it was a much bigger space than I anticipated.  Plus, great food options within walking distance!  Hosts were lovely.  A must stay in Seattle!"
53867,15168375,2014-07-04,2754286,Matthias,"We enjoyed staying in the McCollums' lovely cottage in this quiet neighborhood. Everything we needed in the kitchen was available and the decor was cozy. Unfortunately, the McCollums were not there during our stay, and we would have loved to meet them. There is a bus stop right around the corner, which was helpful for getting around Seattle. We loved the scrumptious baked goods at the cafe that is just a minute up the street."
53867,15251156,2014-07-06,2249755,Paige And Clint,The loft was perfect for our visit to Seattle - we were close to everything we needed and wanted to see but secluded at the same time.
53867,15481573,2014-07-10,11430705,T.J.,"Great self service spot in a nice neighborhood. We were able to arrive near midnight without bothering anyone (except maybe the well behaved chickens km the yard). The apartment is extremely well done, very cozy. Nice bathroom with a medium sized shower. Great amenities provided. Great neighborhood next to lots of food and shopping. Would definitely stay again."
53867,15684031,2014-07-14,12837172,Lindsay,"Such a great place!  This cottage was a perfect place to stay for us.  It was very easy to get to and in a great location.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  The space is AWESOME!!  It is very spacious and clean.  They have really thought of everything you may need (I was extremely grateful for the iron!).  We only stayed here a few days, but could have stayed a week or more.  Everything about the place was wonderful!"
53867,15820304,2014-07-16,13007395,Tamara,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was lovely!  Very private and cozy in a sweet and safe neighborhood! There is a cute little breakfast place around the corner and one block over ""sun flour"" ( I think thats the name) and there is plenty of street parking.  Having a little kitchen was a great perk.  Since my daughter is starting school in the fall, I will definitely be back."
53867,16009285,2014-07-20,1596779,Virginia,"Perfect location, safe with easy good access, the apartment itself was small and quaint. Had all the basics that anyone could need. It was clean and wonderful place to stay after a long day of touring. Hosts were super nice! I would stay again! "
53867,16248475,2014-07-24,15382855,Kirk,"We really enjoyed the cottage. It was the perfect size for my wife and me and our teenage daughter.  It was well stocked with utensils and a small kitchen. The location is very convenient to UW.
"
53867,16453229,2014-07-28,11164914,Susan,"I found the cottage to be quiet, homey, comfortable, and clean, and I felt safe there and slept really well.  I loved the little loft.  It was also very convenient as I was attending a conference at the University of Washington, which was a short distance by bus and the bus stop is just steps from the house.  I also appreciated that there was a Whole Foods nearby.  Email communication before the trip was a bit slow as compared to other airbnb experiences, but it did not affect my stay once I arrived.  I found the McCollum cottage to be excellent value and I would certainly return!"
53867,16702203,2014-08-01,11166641,Cathy,"My son and I so loved our stay at the Backyard Cottage and Loft! Kevin & Jen were wonderful hosts and created a wonderful getaway in an ideal location.
The layout is perfect and flexible, with special touches perfect for a child.
We hope to be back again."
53867,16902563,2014-08-04,37728,Janet,"We had a lovely stay at Kevin and Jennifer's backyard cottage.  The neighborhood is quiet and very walkable.  There are restaurants and stores nearby, we even scored a few things at a garage sale in the neighborhood.   

The cottage has everything you need to cook a meal.  It is super clean and tidy, and very well organized.  There are NO scented soaps used in the bedding and NO scented candles in the cottage.  Thank you for that!  
Great stereo system, television (which we didn't watch) and wifi.  All the comforts of home in this sweet space!   And the bed is comfortable too.  

We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Kevin and Jennifer because we were out so much, and they didn't intrude on our privacy.    They were great with communication and always got right back to us with any questions we had.  

Jennifer and Kevin are great hosts!  We will be back!  "
53867,17099922,2014-08-07,79001,Javier,"Anyone looking for the away from downtown experience should take the opportunity to stay at this beautiful cottage.  I stayed here for a conference at the U and would welcome the chance to stay here again.  Everything is neat, clean, and welcoming.  The co-op is an easy jaunt for fresh groceries and the buses are easy to catch and drop you off very close. Thank you Jennifer and Kevin."
53867,17332517,2014-08-11,12843787,Jake,"Wonderful cottage, excellent communication, and absolutely no complaints. Would love to stay here again if I make it back to Seattle."
53867,17569867,2014-08-14,17340415,Peggy,"This was a roomy cottage, and one night there was even room for our daughter to stay with us. Just a few notes: some parts of the loft were a bit grimy and the shower tends to be cramped. We were also unfortunately visited by large spiders and several earwigs, although Seattle has many bugs in general. Their chickens in the backyard make nice visitors!"
53867,17830515,2014-08-18,16457874,Nicholas,"The cottage was larger than we had expected, a wonderful surprise! We could have easily stayed there with three or four people. The ladder up to the loft was a little steep, but we got the hang of it after going up and down a couple of times. Very quiet, residential neighborhood. We would definitely stay there again."
53867,17986463,2014-08-19,20025936,Lisa,"I booked last minute with Kevin and Jennifer. They were flexible and made it possible to stay even on short notice.  The place was comfortable,  quiet and despite being close to their home we had plenty of privacy. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends. "
53867,18065755,2014-08-21,16182550,Peter,"Die Wohnung stimmte genau mit den Bildern und der Beschreibung überein. Jennifer hat uns später noch begrüßt und uns Bezüge für das Sofa gebracht. Wir haben uns hier sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Entfenung zur Bushaltestelle war noch geringer als erwartet(50 Meter). Wir würden, falls wir in Seattle sind gerne wieder kommen."
53867,18170275,2014-08-23,4670435,Catherine,"We had a lovely stay at the McCollum's Backyard college and loft.  The space is small, so the full kitchen and bathroom are tight and efficient like a ship.  This is balanced by a spacious living space with high ceilings and nice light. The loft bed is comfortable.  The area is quiet overall accented during the day by the sounds chlldren near by and a few warbley chickens in the yard. The house is very clean. Kevin and Jennifer were very helpful but unobtrusive. I would highly recommend this hideaway in the U district."
53867,19193374,2014-09-08,16690333,Jee,"Wonderful, comfortable place to stay in Seattle, had great night sleep on both nights I staid. No problem finding the residence, had a chance to briefly meet the hosts and they were kind. Quiet and everything you'd need was provided, good wireless and amenities. If you are looking to walk to you nearest bar or don't enjoy soft mattress, might not be the place for you. "
53867,19373419,2014-09-11,19840176,Matt,"Our stay at the backyard cottage was great. The location is excellent in a great neighborhood with plenty to do. 

The cottage is exactly as stated, with the bedroom in a loft with ladder access. I (6'2"") had no trouble in the loft bedroom, and the bed was plenty comfortable for a pleasant night's sleep."
53867,19539399,2014-09-14,754129,Dana,"Easy communication and a convenient, private space in a quiet neighborhood.  Nicely appointed and furnished with everything we needed.  We especially enjoyed the ""family"" feeling of the block and surrounding neighborhood."
53867,19691064,2014-09-16,13008856,James,Better than advertised. My father and I felt right at home in our cozy cottage for the weekend. Everything was nice and clean. We also enjoyed having a small kitchen. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone wanting a break from your usual hotel.  
53867,19842058,2014-09-19,17467770,David,We had such a lovely stay at the cottage. It was much bigger than what we expected and very clean. The chickens at the bottom of the garden were adorable. Would certainly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again when we visit Seattle in the future. 
53867,20035836,2014-09-22,390714,Tiffany,"We stayed for a short weekend to attend IFBC in Seattle, and wanted to stay in a place that was more like home than a hotel. That's how we travel... Kevin and Jennifer's place was super cute and cozy with all the amenities of home. Climbing the ladder to the bedroom was fun and felt like we were staying in a tree house with the private treed view. My favorite was watching the chickens in the morning from the kitchen window :) 
The place is stocked with everything, and the bose system was nice to stream our music from. We only wished we could have spent more time here! I definitely recommend staying here when traveling thru instead of those over priced hotels! "
53867,20552717,2014-10-01,16516012,Maurits,"Wonderful cottage in a nice neighbourhood of Seattle.  The cottage is well equipped with all the things we needed. We cooked some dinners for ourselves and the kitchen was quite good. The stairs to  the loft are a bit steep, but doesn't pose a problem after 1 night. The bus to downtown is just around the corner. We recommend this place."
53867,20822327,2014-10-06,2859916,Kineret,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Jennifer and Kevin were lovely hosts, who responded quickly and communicated effectively. The cottage was perfect for our needs. Kitchen and bath were tiny but had everything we needed. The cottage is located in a beautiful street with a good place for breakfast and lunch a small block away. Will stay again.  Highly recommended if you need to stay in the area. "
53867,21148029,2014-10-12,21368788,Rene,"The cottage was great and the location was beautiful.
You had everything you would need  for amenities including, a kitchen, microwave, free internet, TV w/DVD player, warm heat, heated floor, etc.
There are even cute hens in the backyard.
The price was great and we would definitely stay there again.

53867,21349919,2014-10-15,21508162,Leanna,Kevin and Jennifer were really quick with their replies when we had any enquiries regarding the AirBnb. The cottage was really cosy and warm. It was very well maintained and had everything that we needed. We recommend it to everyone else.
53867,21476548,2014-10-18,19204632,Shelby,The backyard loft was wonderful! When we arrived it was just as described. It was close to multiple things! The space is just the right size. Once you use the ladder a couple times you get used to it also. We did not get to meet Kevin and Jennifer but if my husband and I  head back that way we would definitely stay there again. Thanks again!
53867,21620181,2014-10-20,22168644,Holly,What a great place to stay while visiting my daughter at UW! A cute place and a perfect location!
53867,21806629,2014-10-24,22571243,Nancy Lynn,"The backyard cottage was excellent for my few days of solitude needed while working on a professional project. Warm, Clean and very comfortable bed! I highly recommend Kevin & Jennifer's backyard cottage. Although, I didn't meet them, I ran across some very friendly neighbors on a casual stroll...
"
53867,21938697,2014-10-27,1585521,Sheila,"The listing was as described. Comfortable,clean, and convenient. The ladder to the loft was a little challenging(and could be dangerous) in the middle of the night, but as long as the traveler knows what to expect, it was doable. I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in the morning. I would stay here again if I return next fall."
53867,22581165,2014-11-10,422192,Alisa,"We were greeted by Jennifer upon arrival and she was super sweet in explaining everything about the rental cottage. (And even heated up the floors so they would be warm when we arrived..score!)

The cottage itself was awesome - heated floors, space enough for three adults and just cute/comfortable. The bed was clean and we had no problems with anything while staying here for two nights. 

The location is awesome - right in the University District, so there were lots of restaurants/coffee shops nearby and it was a fairly quick trip into the city. 

Thanks for an awesome stay! :)"
53867,22706166,2014-11-12,22629854,Liz,"The cottage was nice and warm when I arrived which was nice considering it was a rainy day. It's in a residential neighborhood but within short driving distances from everything I needed. Nice space, well designed and interesting use of space. Slept really well, and it was very quiet."
53867,22900791,2014-11-17,16438135,Lane,"Very clean, nicely designed, comfortable and spacious. The ladder to the bedroom is easy to climb. We had a lovely time. The neighborhood is quiet and very convenient to shops in the U Village. "
53867,23182700,2014-11-24,15104082,Haley,"The description of the home was spot on!  It's a very cute, detached cottage in the backyard but it's very private.  You get to the cottage up the driveway so it's not like you are walking through someone's yard to get there.  We really enjoyed our stay!  Kevin and Jennifer were super responsive and friendly when we had questions leading up to our arrival.  The cottage was perfect for my husband and I.  The loft bedroom was really no big deal for us and added to the charm.  Great location for a Husky football game (even though our team lost) and very convenient to the bus line.  We had a great trip and this cottage met all our needs!  You could easily do 2 couples or a family in this place as well.  It will be cozy but would work.  "
53867,23574276,2014-12-05,11181873,Steven,"Kevin and Jennifer's place was fantastic. They provided all of the info we needed before our arrival. Our stay could not have possibly gone any smoother. The cottage itself is great and we loved the coziness of the loft. Additionally, so many great places to eat and drink nearby. Very very walkable. I would definitely recommend staying there."
53867,23908771,2014-12-14,20331563,Ann Marie,"We got in pretty late at night and notified Kevin and Jennifer that we were traveling late and they left the lights on for us which was very thoughtful. When we got in, the space was very clean and warm, the heated tiles were wonderful and made me seriously considered getting it installed in my own home. The cottage was much more spacious than I assumed and nice and quiet. The location is perfect because it's not too far from downtown. I definitely recommend staying here and I'm sure I'll be back in the future!"
53867,24003753,2014-12-16,5775630,Sara,"My boyfriend and I needed a relaxing getaway for a few days and this place was perfect. We were using only public transportation and didn't have a problem at all- the house is located right off the bus line. Jennifer stopped by right after we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed, and also have us recommendations on a cafe only a few blocks away (amazing comfort food, go there!) as well as told us there was a Top Pot donuts nearby. The space was cozy and just right to relax in. Couldn't recommend this place more. "
53867,24145286,2014-12-21,23833649,A-Rod,"My wife and I had such a fun week staying in your beautiful little ""house!"" It had everything we needed, and the heated floor was wonderful! We loved listening to the rain on the roof, and watching the chickens out in the yard. The kitchen was perfect, complimented by the amazing heated floor, and we ended up cooking so many evening meals instead of going out. (I LOVE gas stoves.) The neighborhood was also lovely. My wife went on several morning runs, and we even went to the park that was nearby. We also hit up ""top pot doughnuts"" which was also within walking distance. Thank you so much for letting us stay here! We had a wonderful honeymoon, and were so grateful to have such a cute, clean, fun, amazing place to stay. Plus we both really loved the chickens outside our window :) Thanks Kevin and Jennifer. "
53867,24240659,2014-12-23,24344262,Erin,"Excellent space for a mini staycation. Our hosts were wonderful.  The ladder was a little awkward to manuever, but nothing we didn't anticipate."
53867,24464446,2014-12-29,21933366,William,"The cottage was exactly as described, and exactly what we needed while we spent eight days visiting our son in the University District. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood, we were able to park in front of the cottage with no problems. The fully equipped kitchen made cooking and food preparation very convenient. Walking access via. a driveway made coming and going very private.  A large TV located in a wall of book shelves was connected to a sound system and a Wii system.

Would we stay here again? Absolutely!"
53867,24790972,2015-01-02,25191559,Elizabeth,"We had a very comfortable stay at this wonderful airbnb. Good location as well! It was easy to get everywhere we needed. Parking was also without worry. It was clean, cozy, and perfect for our stay. "
53867,25094785,2015-01-06,15908307,Shaun,Great experience.  Nice having an entire place to stay.  Very quiet
53867,25328183,2015-01-12,25274469,Ed,"This was a nice, quiet, and private place to stay.  Everything was as the host described, and they were very easy to communicate with.  The upstairs loft for sleeping was a bit awkward to get to but all in all very nice. 

Thanks!"
53867,25483148,2015-01-17,7043575,Rick,"What a great little place!!! Great location, well appointed and a touch of both practicality and whimsy w the sleeping loft...lots of privacy and convenient to many amenities for dining, shopping etc!!...Kevin and Jennifer were super responsive on the two occasions where I had questions. A great stay and a good value."
53867,25605638,2015-01-20,24626727,Shannon,"Kevin and Jennifers beautiful, quaint loft was perfect for a weekend getaway in Washington. The neighborhood was quiet and clean. The loft was clean, tidy and had anything you needed. Although my guest and I did not meet Kevin and Jennifer in person, they were easy to contact and communicate with through e-mail or by phone. They left us a welcome note that explained where things were, how to access the Wi-Fi, and where to contact them with any questions. My guest and I loved the loft bedroom. The bed was so comfortable and the space of the room was great. Since we visited in January the weather was a bit cold. Kevin and Jennifer had the place heated for us once we arrived which was great. Heater was easy to use and the heated floors were an awesome feature! The U District has lots of cute bars, restaurants and small shops to check out and within walking distance. It is not far from downtown Seattle but still a nice change of pace from the big city.  It was the perfect place for us to spend a quick weekend and a great first Airbnb experience. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Washington. "
53867,26172600,2015-02-05,1467869,Brian,"Nice bed, cool loft, no realy issues."
53867,26312612,2015-02-09,26065843,Adam,Very beautiful place and easy to get to. The heated floors were amazing and having the tv with the wii definitely helped with any down time we had. It was only about 5 minutes away from a shopping center and there were endless places to eat. I would definitely choose this place again and would recommend it to anyone looking for something close to Seattle but far enough to get away from busy roads where it is hard to park.
53867,26690531,2015-02-17,3707444,Jon,This is a lovely and private apartment. Was perfect for our needs. Great stay!
53867,27641714,2015-03-09,13007395,Tamara,"This was my second time at Kevin & Jennifer's and it was enjoyable this time as much as it was last time.  It is a safe location, good street parking.  The cottage is very clean, comfortable and private."
53867,28266089,2015-03-21,15063439,Jake,"Great place, great location, great parking. What else is there to say? "
53867,28520503,2015-03-25,27324892,Darin,"The cottage was great - exactly as described and photographed. The process was very smooth, exactly as explained by the hosts by email. We had a wonderful stay in the cottage - great location, it was quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended! I'll definitely be looking to come back in the future!"
53867,28735046,2015-03-29,28469864,Jingjing,The place is so cozy that became the highlight of my 3 day Seattle visiting. All the rooms are clean and you can't imagine how equipped this house is. You can find anything you want and we enjoy the 500pc puzzles. : ) Love the ladder to the bed! Highly recommend to those visiting Seattle and the location is great if you rent a car.  
53867,28988814,2015-04-02,13961194,Lauren,Kevin and Jennifer's place was perfect for our quick Seattle trip. The cute back house looks just like in the pictures and the heated floors were amazing. Jennifer was quick to respond to any questions and the house was stocked with all the amenities. The water heater was a little small but quick showers worked for me and my husband. The house is in a great location and close to Green Lake and University of Washington. We had a wonderful time in Seattle and would recommend this AirBnB to all our friends!
53867,29860583,2015-04-13,29833110,Jessica,"Our stay there was great! The house was charming and clean! The neighborhood was safe and friendly, we spoke to neighbors.   I loved it and would stay there again. "
53867,30243273,2015-04-19,29401797,Carrie,"We absolutely loved our stay in this perfect little cottage! Beautiful neighborhood, close to many shops and eateries, just as the listing described. We spent 4 days touring all over the city, and this was a perfect retreat at the end of each day. Check in and out were smooth, and we had everything we needed. Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle! Thank you!"
53867,30406289,2015-04-21,716499,Elise,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in the cottage! It is clean, nice, and comfortable. The bed (in the loft) is comfortable and you feel like you're in a treehouse. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, and we were able to walk to a PCC and a donut shop! The only problem with the cottage is that the hot water is very minimal. "
53867,30498394,2015-04-23,9564959,Kate,"This was the perfect spot. We wished we were staying longer. It was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Free street parking was wonderful as well. The ladder to the loft was no problem for us, and they were sure to warn us ahead of time that this might not be the best for some travelers, which was very considerate. Loved this place and will hopefully return next time we visit. Thanks!"
53867,31344679,2015-05-04,22168644,Holly,This is the second time we've stayed here- we love it and we'll be back!
53867,31972979,2015-05-12,31669922,Elisabeth,"We had a wonderful stay at this Air BnB. It is clean, comfortable, and spacious.  The neighborhood is charming and a nice break from the busier parts of Seattle.  Walk-able to the University and an easy bus-ride to downtown.  We'll definitely stay again if in the area.  Thank you Kevin and Jennifer!"
53867,32176263,2015-05-15,9250951,Samantha,Kevin & Jennifer's house is very comfortable and warm for us. It is really clean and safe location. They provided us most useful guide of Seattle. We will book it again if we go Seattle other chance. 
53867,32412301,2015-05-17,3792679,Xufei,It is soooo nice to live in this beautiful little cottage! I haven't seen Kevin &Jennifer. But they relpied me really fast. The place is enough for 3 people and the neiborhood is really quiet! Really love the place!
53867,32522860,2015-05-19,3427783,Cynthia,Great location and neighbourhood! Clean and spacious with everything you need. This was our second visit and we are looking forward to staying again in the future!  Try the Bryant Corner Cafe for breakfast.
53867,33063658,2015-05-25,25842137,Kelsey,Kevin and Jennifer's Cottage was the perfect place for our stay. Not only was it nice to feel at home but we had enough space to spend time relaxing at the cottage. The perfect space and comfy bed! We took advantage of movie nights and Wii Bowling for a relaxing vacation. Parking was a breeze and it's location is close to I-5 and the ave. Overall a place I would stay again.
53867,33529078,2015-05-29,30324583,Clover,This lovely cottage is really cozy and well-equipped to make us feel at home. The bed is super comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. There's a bus stop located only 1-min away. We have a FANTASTIC stay and recommend this place to anyone.
53867,33790341,2015-06-01,30156215,Tara,"We had a wonderful stay at the McCollum cottage! It was very clean and tidy, and the neighborhood was beautiful. We were able to walk or bus to everything we wanted to see. Thanks so much for the lovely trip!"
53867,34122814,2015-06-05,10554138,Nga,"Jennifer & Kevin's cottage was exactly as it was pictured. All of the additional items, especially in the kitchen, were useful for when we decided to make breakfast or hang out for the night. It was comfortable, clean and very homey. 

Downtown was roughly a 15-20 minute trip by car, UW is very close, and yet, the cottage was far away enough to keep the area fairly quiet. Grateful to have come across this posting! "
53867,34622682,2015-06-10,18199278,Michael,"While we didn't get to meet Kevin & Jennifer it felt as if we did. When you check-in there's a note with all the guidelines to the home and how to use certain devices and appliances. The cottage was the perfect size for 2-3 people and matches exactly with the description. The pictures posted are a perfect portrayal of how the home looks inside and outside. I really enjoyed staying here when I was in Seattle because it felt as if I was at home rather than a tourist staying in a hotel. The neighbors were very friendly too. The neighborhood was beautiful and felt super safe. It seemed like a combination of families and UW students. The only downside was the weekend we visited was very warm and the bedroom got stuffy. We weren't sure if there was AC or not so we just left the windows open and it eventually cooled down. All in all, if I had the chance to come back I would stay here!"
53867,35200545,2015-06-16,14146427,Gretta,"My first airbnb experience and it was wonderful.  The cottage is very well appointed, clean and offers everything you'll need to have a lovely stay. There is even an iron and portable ironing board which I used.  The hosts provided me with regular bedding when I informed them that I'm allergic to down-very accommodating.  They also left the outside porch light on for my late arrival.  Location is convenient and in a nice quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed the heated tile floor on the cool nights.  For convenience I chose to sleep downstairs on the futon instead of the loft.  Parking in front of the main house was easy.  I arrived late around midnight and hand carried my luggage instead of dragging it on wheels up the short incline to the back cottage so as not to make too much noise.  My son lives only 5 blocks away so it's very convenient for me to visit him.  I'll definitely be back and plan to stay at this lovely cottage again.  Thank you Kevin & Jennifer for offering me a home away from home.  Aloha!"
53867,35909878,2015-06-23,21933366,William,"Excellent pre-visit communication and seamless entry made this visit very easy.

A Thai restaurant is nearby, as is an authentic French restaurant. Several block away in the university district is an authentic neighborhood bar (The Duchess) that is dog friendly and has shuffleboard. 

The kitchen is well equipped if you wish to prepare your own meals.

On street parking is never a problem."
53867,36539834,2015-06-29,28159866,Delphia,"Great neighborhood with easy access to the bus line. The cottage was lovely, comfortable with all the amenities needed, including a TV and Wi-fi.
I didn't meet the host but was in contact via email.  They were very accommodating when I asked to check in a little earlier than check-in time.  I have already referred a friend who plans to visit Seattle in a few months and I would stay again in a heartbeat.  I have to say that the ladder to the loft took a little getting used to but was pretty cool. Also, I was there during record heat (90 Degrees) and the place was still comfy.  "
53867,37191591,2015-07-05,35110048,Zoe,"We had a lovely time at Kevin and Jennifer's cottage. The cottage was clean, cozy, and welcoming. The location is excellent - very walkable. Check-in was super easy and Kevin and Jennifer were very responsive. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend! "
53867,37448062,2015-07-07,26769202,Lauri,Our hosts made us feel very welcomed.  We had arrived late in the evening and the porch light was on for us.  The neighborhood was quaint and clean.  We enjoyed our stay.
53867,37957250,2015-07-12,30567194,Ben,"The backyard cottage was exactly as described and photographed. Very clean and quite spacious. My wife and I found the kitchenette to be very nice and functional, and we cooked most of our meals there during our stay. We also loved the ladder leading up to the bedroom; it's very unique and feels like you're climbing up into a treehouse! Though we did not meet the hosts, they left very informative notes for us and made us feel at home. The neighborhood is totally quiet and safe as well, and we found a great dive bar within walking distance for a drink. Though it's in a backyard, you have your own space that is totally private. We would definitely stay there again!"
53867,38491083,2015-07-16,31092414,Jenna,"Kevin and Jennifer were so easy to communicate with. They made check-in and check-out a breeze! The cottage & loft were perfectly clean (thank you Mary!). Everyone we met including the neighbor and Kevin and Jennifer's main house guest, Bob, were welcoming and gave us great suggestions for things to do in the city. Bob even helped carry my heavy bag up the driveway! The cottage perfectly suited our needs - private, cozy, clean, and easily accessible after a long day! If we ever visit Seattle again we won't stay anywhere else! "
53867,38710243,2015-07-18,31829515,Kacie,"Kevin and Jennifer's place was just as  the pictures showed! The cottage is spacious for moving around, and everything was perfectly in order. The bed is amazingly comfortable, perfect for coming back to after a busy day. We didn't get to meet the owners because they were out of town, but because everything went so smoothly, I think that says a lot about how they take care of their place. We also ate at the Bryant Corner Cafe, listed in their guidebook, and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life. I would want to return to Kevin and Jennifer's cottage on my next Seattle stay. "
53867,39100024,2015-07-20,22773686,Ashley,Such a perfect place to stay! Everything was so clean and exactly as advertised. If we are ever back in the area I'll be sure to book a stay here. 
53867,39490033,2015-07-24,89070,Jenny,"The cottage is very comfortable, spacious, warm and quiet, a great place to stay whilst attending a conference in Seattle. It's about two miles from UW and close to the Burke-Gilman bike trail. I found it easy to get around on a rented bike. The hosts were very helpful by email concerning a problem with wifi, and helped to find a solution within a couple of hours. "
53867,39822237,2015-07-26,2406561,Dezbah,The place was exactly as described. Smooth checkin process and clean cottage. I also really like the neighborhood. It was walking to restaurants and shopping. I would stay here again. 
53867,40089163,2015-07-28,30598369,Alyssa,The cottage was great! The loft was so much bigger than I imagined and the kitchen had everything we needed. The guidebook was THE BEST! We hit 4-5 things on the recommended list. Thank you!! So conveniently located to downtown. 
53867,41945044,2015-08-10,34139568,Harold,We were very satisfied with our experience.  Would certainly choose to stay here again if visiting the area.  Living space was ample for myself and my two teenagers. Location was very convenient.  Hosts were very conscientious and informative.  Many thanks for helping make our vacation an enjoyable one.
53867,42519694,2015-08-14,3198974,Patrick,"We had a great stay in Seattle. The cottage was as described and even better than on the fotos. Unfortunately we couldn't meet Kevin and Jennifer personally because they were on vacation too, nevertheless check-in was no problem. The cottage was full equipped and had everything we needed. The neighbourhood was also nice and the bus station was just a 2 minute walk away from the cottage. But depending on the traffic the ride to downtown needs 30-60 minutes, by car it's much faster. So overall we would give 5 stars for the cottage and 3 stars for the bus connection."
53867,44097896,2015-08-24,12843787,Jake,"This was my second time staying here because I loved the first time so much, and it was just as great this time. The cottage is lovely and had everything we needed."
53867,44599736,2015-08-27,26039404,Mimi,"Very clean cottage, 2 houses in from the bus line, so very easy to get to even without a car. Quiet side street- street noise doesn't travel up to house.We stayed for 2 nights, and found it comfortable and convenient. Did not have direct contact with the hosts while we were there, as they're out of town, but they provided us with their numbers in case of problems (but there weren't any!)"
53867,45068011,2015-08-31,13304248,Wouter,"We had a very comfortable stay, everything clean and in place, good restaurants and bus stop around the corner, and 100% privacy. "
53867,45704481,2015-09-05,40011731,Laura,"The cottage was absolutely perfect for our stay in Seattle! It was cozy, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Everything was clear in the check-in/check-out process (super easy!). It was located in a great neighborhood, but wasn't a far drive away from the rest of the city. We had a rental car, so we didn't take the bus, but I noticed there was a stop really close by.

I highly recommend the cottage!"
53867,46146688,2015-09-08,39032946,Liz,"The cottage was adorable and had everything we needed. We had no interaction with Kevin and Jennifer but the directions were very clear and we had no problems making ourselves at home. :) The neighborhood was great, short drive to downtown and very close to UW. Highly recommend!!"
53867,46917428,2015-09-14,4968182,Robert,"My girlfriend and I had a great time staying in Kevin and Jennifer's guest cottage. Although they were not there in person, their advanced communication and clear instructions made arrival seamless and easy. The cottage itself is super cute and impeccably clean. We really enjoyed the comfy bed and nice bright downstairs space. Street parking was also easy to find right in front of their home. I would definitely stay here again and recommend for anyone looking for a place to stay in the U District. "
53867,48187161,2015-09-24,33495669,Laura,"Thank you Kevin and Jennifer! The place was exactly as described. It was a great location and parking was very easy.  We appreciate your hospitality. Lots of space and the heated floors were wonderful in the morning when it was a little chilly.  Very clean, dishes, glasses, etc. if you planned to cook. Lots of travel/sightseeing books.  Close to UW if you are visiting a child.  Definitely worth the stay!"
53867,49827391,2015-10-06,44610365,Marjorie,The place was exactly as pictured and described.  Very nice and very comfortable.  The upstairs room (via ladder) is probably not useful for those over 40 but the owners clearly advised me of that.  They gave me the option to have a fold out bed downstairs which I used and it was very comfortable.  The area is very nice and convenient.  It was great!
53867,50627631,2015-10-13,1483196,Alan,"We had a great experience here. The location was good for what we were planning on doing during our stay, and the cottage was small but cozy. We felt welcome and didn't have any problems during our stay."
53867,51240963,2015-10-18,14958405,Sira,"Die Unterkunft war schön, sehr geräumig, sehr sauber und ordentlich.  Das Haus befindet sich in unmittelbarer Nähe zu einer Bushaltestelle und man kommt daher problemlos in die Stadt. Auch wenn wir die Gastgeber nicht persönlich kennengelernt haben, hat der Ablauf reibungslos geklappt. Uns hat der Aufenthalt sehr gut gefallen. "
53867,52400870,2015-10-29,42104839,Irving,"Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place.  Everything was very clean, and as described.  It was easy to find, and had everything we needed.  Parking was easy, except if you park blocking your driveway you may get a $35 ticket.  Don't know if it was just for blocking the driveway, or because in was trash day.  Other than that, everything was great."

53867,55131518,2015-11-28,10302113,Jessica,"The cottage and loft was very cute and  perfect for our Thanksgiving stay in Seattle. Check in and out was simple, parking was easy and the kitchen had everything we needed. Would stay there again for sure."
3061918,13386373,2014-05-26,7488141,Reinhold,"Having made last minute changes in our travel plans, Scott was eager to accommodate our needs. With prior approval, he even allowed our small dog to accompany us. His house is located within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and Rapid Transit to downtown Seattle. We had our own entrance which was easily accessible. 

Scott greeted us at the prearranged time and gave us a tour and the key to his home. The bedroom was located in the finished basement with an adjacent sitting room equipped with large flat screen tv for our use.  

Even though we left early each morning and returned in the evening we felt we could have easily spent more time relaxing in Scott's home. "
3061918,14104737,2014-06-11,16354397,Tom,"I must my stay with Scott  was awesome! A truly gracious host, and a really laid back and cool guy to hangout with. He's got a really cute house in west Seattle that's about ten minutes from the main drag of bars and restaurants. Great location!  He's very knowledgable about Seattle and can direct you anywhere you'd like to go. The room downstairs was super private and spacious. It was actually a living room and a bedroom with a separate entrance that made it see like a separate apartment unit. Very private! The house was super clean and cozy, and with a cool host like Scott it's a no brainer to stay there when in west Seattle!"
3061918,14645140,2014-06-23,16388523,Carol Lloyd,"Scott was very accommodating. His house was very clean and well-organized. He was welcoming and concerned for my comfort. He asked if all was OK or if he needed to provide anything. When I asked for something, he quickly got what I needed.
Neighborhood is nice. One block away is a marvelous view of Mt. Rainier!"
3061918,15158139,2014-07-03,17127794,Angela,"This was a great spot in an excellent neighbourhood as a base to explore a little of what Seattle has to offer. 
Good locale for access to transport, shops & restaurants a short walk away.
Scott was a great host giving of his time, without intruding on our privacy. 
Easy place to stay & would recommend it to others.
"
3061918,16121173,2014-07-22,11336314,Victor,"My stay at Scott's ""classic tudor"" was a great Airbnb experience. Scott is a fantastic host and very welcoming. The room i stayed in was very clean, well furnished with a comfy bed, TV and Wi-Fi access. All in all, pretty awesome experience. Would definitely recommend."
3061918,16322666,2014-07-25,14574657,Piotr,"Scott was an excellent host!  He was a maintaining a perfect balance between making sure we have everything what needed and respecting our privacy.

Neighbourhood is really quiet and easily accessible by a public transportation - West Seattle is really worth exporing.

The bedroom we've stayed in was tidy and had a comfortable bed.  There was also a separate, spacious room with TV+cable+Xbox combo.

I would definitely recommend staying with Scott if you get a chance."
3061918,16636499,2014-07-30,17834355,Ben,"Scott was a wonderful host, his house was clean and tidy and located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown. He gave us some great suggestions of things to do and places to eat in both West and Downtown Seattle. We would suggest using the water taxi from West Seattle, its easy and within walking distance of Scott's place and provides a nice view of the city and surrounding areas. We felt very welcome in his house and would definitely recommend Scott to anyone using Airbnb in Seattle. "
3061918,16869925,2014-08-03,7974889,Karin,"Scott was a very friendly and helpful host. He had maps and guidebooks of the area, and were very knowledgable about the national parks and bars/restaurants around Seattle. The room were cool and separated from the rest of the house, as it is located in the basement. The location is in WestSeattle, which requires you to take a water-taxi or a bus into town. This will take you about 30 min from the door. We had everything we needed and found the stay with Scott to be really nice! "
3061918,17075324,2014-08-06,10287299,Carson,This was really a first rate experience.  You get the whole bottom floor (a bedroom and living room area) to yourself and everything felt new and immaculately clean.  Scott was extremely friendly and helpful.
3061918,17709806,2014-08-16,11547997,Raymond,Scott was a great host. I definitely felt welcome there. He made accommodations for my bikes as well as took me out a couple times to show me around the city.  I felt like i was visiting an old friend. Would definitely recommend him to any guest.
3061918,30799059,2015-04-27,29476074,John,"Scott was very welcoming when I arrived.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and with very comfortable accomidations.   If I had any questions or issues, Scott was helpful in resolving them.  Thanks again Scott!"

I highly recommend it and recommend to others!
Thank you Scott"
3061918,32928218,2015-05-23,13706473,David,"Classic Tudor in West Seattle hosted by Scott was an excellent location to stay for seeing Seattle. It's in a very quiet, safe neighborhood with all the charm of local Seattle just a few blocks from Puget Sound. It is within walking distance of several restaurants and coffee shops on the California Avenue business corridor as well as Fauntleroy, Avalon and Harbor Avenue-that leads out to Alki beach. By car it is a few minutes from the West Seattle bridge towards the rest of the planet.  There is a public library down the street.  Great Wi-Fi and television in the private downstairs space with its own entrance. The host shares the upstairs bathroom and provides towels and soap at the time of this review; also shares his refrigerator, and makes great coffee for you in the morning.  He's working on the finishing touches of your own private full bathroom in the down stairs area and it is impressive. The bed was very comfortable and the space was welcoming- very easy. The host is very mechanically and IT inclined, a peddle bike and motorcycle enthusiast. He knows a lot about the area and is very helpful about all things Seattle. I  highly recommend."
3061918,34587579,2015-06-09,4977025,Meredith,"Scott was the perfect host- he was friendly, helpful, and made time for us. He also lent us bicycles to wander around West Seattle with! Scott had great suggestions for restaurants, watering holes, and activities. The house was peaceful, clean, and very well appointed.  If you want a really 'local' experience of Seattle, this is the place to stay-- we wouldn't want to go anywhere else!"
3061918,38233716,2015-07-13,37082827,Michael,"We can see why Scott is a super host. He is outgoing, friendly, kind and accommodating. The space was exactly as advertised and the completely remodeled bathroom was a plus with its fantastic shower. The backyard is a comfortable place to hang out around a fire pit under a gorgeous tree. We would definitely stay here again. The West Seattle neighborhood is a gem and Scott's home is a jewel."
3061918,40765575,2015-08-02,29766343,Thomas,"Scott was incredibly hospitable to both my dog Martin and I, making any number of accommodations for us and going above and beyond to make this a memorable stay at a truly AWESOME place. A few of countless examples: He put a paving stone with a water bowl that he bought outside the back door for Martin and took him for regular walks. He gave me more West Seattle recommendations and kale from his garden than I knew what to do with. 
Scott's house has just been renovated (mostly by the man himself); the lower level (guests' quarters) has got to be one of the freshest pads in the city and is stocked with great reading material, tech gadgets, etc. The kitchen is equally well-stocked and the whole house and neighborhood itself are indeed quiet, clean, and couldn't be more conveniently-situated. 
The fusion of Scott's amicable personality, his constant efforts to be a caring, courteous host, and the breadth and depth of interests and experiences that fill his active life all mean one thing: if I had one recommendation for a place to stay in a city I know and love (but not like Scott does), I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"
3061918,41803936,2015-08-09,37983669,郑,Scott is a nice host. And the house is really nice. I have a perfect experience these days.
3061918,44317053,2015-08-25,6171192,Agnes,"This was a most welcoming nearly two week stay. With its location in a lovely neighborhood, with a sweet bedroom, an excellent well-working and lovely bathroom and a well-equipped sitting / work space with more electronics than we were up to, with easy street parking and a short walk to both the Junction and to the Admiral district, the space was outstanding. Scott was / is the other half of this excellence; friendly, interested and welcoming but also sensitive to our needing to get a certain amount of work done during the stay, Scott was a terrific host. While we wish we could have visited more and perhaps shared a meal, we were certainly grateful for guidance around and suggestions about West Seattle. We would return in a heartbeat. "
3061918,45876687,2015-09-06,41631274,Brandon,Scott was an excellent host and his spot is a great little place to stay when visiting Seattle.
3061918,54243253,2015-11-17,45164734,Paula,"We just returned from a great 6 day trip to Seattle and Scott's comfortable retreat. We had the entire basement, with a private outside entrance. The gorgeous bathroom had a shower my husband still raves about. Scott is a friendly, knowledgeable and very gracious host. His Seattle coffee was a treat every morning. This is a very charming home. The downstairs bedroom has a twin size trundle bed, which pulls out to another twin bed. The family room has a comfortable futon. The location is a short walk to West Seattle shops. You will be happy you stayed here!"
6927016,37810880,2015-07-10,34674087,Michelle,"I booked this very last minute and was relieved to find it to be exactly as the photos show, as well as exactly what I needed.  The space is clean and bright, with fun decorative touches.  The bed was fine, comfortable, and the bathroom was fully stocked with shampoo, soap, etc...  The kitchen had the basics for a simple meal prep or coffee/tea service.  Elena was very helpful via text with restaurant recomendations and info on the neighborhood.  This is the perfect place for a single or couple. "
6927016,38205866,2015-07-13,37457033,Martinique,"The room was exactly what I was hoping for after seeing the listing. It was located in a convenient Seattle neighborhood and the room was laid out perfectly. The building was safe, the room comfortable, and Elena was easy to reach. "
6927016,38647708,2015-07-17,16912599,Robert,"Elena was most helpful and answered all my inquiries.  Place was easy to find with a simple lock box and the location was great.  The place is simple, very well stocked and homey.  I loved the fact that you can get a good cross breeze with opening windows and good natural light.  Wished I could have met Elena, she seemed so nice.  I would love to stay there again...feels like my hood."
6927016,39211589,2015-07-21,15871387,Chris,"Elena is a 5 star host! I am a host myself and Elena sets the bar very high.  Easy entry with lock box key.  Comfortable bed and ridiculously soft sheets, amazing hot shower with everything you could possibly think of from luxury bath products, body lotion to Qtips and sunblock :]  Also a great kitchen with and incredible selection of gourmet shop teas and everything you could need for cooking.  The bedroom is large and bright, but has blinds for sleeping in and a great breeze.   This place blows the top of any luxury hotel in the area for half the price.  An amazing find, thanks! Elena "
6927016,39428409,2015-07-23,28661303,Saurabh,"This was a very bright and cozy studio at the heart of Capitol Hill. Elena made sure all arrangements were in place, was extremely prompt in answering any questions or clarifying logistics, and even left a list of recommendations of things to do while in Seattle (very useful) - restaurants, bars places to visit etc. Overall, it was a very pleasant and comfortable experience for me. I'd highly recommend this listing!"
6927016,40785492,2015-08-02,19760130,Dwight,We had an excellent stay at Elena's!  The room was small but comfortable and filled with Star Wars art!  The TV came equipped with Amazon prime so there were free movies available to fall asleep to.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and fully stocked with more supplies than expected.  It was very hot and the fan provided worked fine.  All in all we had a comfortable stay in Capitol Hill!
6927016,41012826,2015-08-03,39552483,Bevin,"We had a great stay in Elena's Capitol Hill studio! The apartment was exactly as described, if not better :) Great amenities, good location, and everything went smoothly. Elena even got us a bottle of champagne for our anniversary stay! How thoughtful! Would definitely recommend staying with Elena. Thanks!"
6927016,41235713,2015-08-05,36095578,Maria,The studio was adorable and in a great neighborhood. Lots of restaurants around and really central to walking everywhere. The host thought of everything and we really appreciated that! We had a really comfortable stay and highly recommend! 
6927016,41403373,2015-08-07,399448,Ryszard,"Our host provided all the information we needed to access the apartment and get settled.  There were fresh flowers to greet us in every room and plenty of toiletries to make our stay easy. We very much appreciated the parking space our host was able to arrange at a minimal cost.  It was an easy walk to Capital Hill restaurants and public transportation was nearby.  All-in-all, a good place to hang your hat for a few days while visiting Seattle!"
6927016,41799650,2015-08-09,6474551,Aimee,The unit was just as described and had all that we needed during our stay. If you forgot a toiletry item Elena has you covered! The bed was comfy and the room was sunny and bright in the morning time. The neighborhood was walkable and safe. We had a great stay!
6927016,42155002,2015-08-11,9897652,Aaron,"This apartment is amazing and is a steal for the price. It's very centrally located, right in Capitol Hill and a quick walk to downtown. The kitchen is well-stocked with complimentary teas and coffees, which is totally unnecessary due to the plethora of excellent restaurants and cool coffeeshops in the area. Elena was extremely helpful and responsive as well."
6927016,42417439,2015-08-13,1583297,Jenny,"We loved our two nights in Elena's Capitol Hill studio! It was cozy and adorable, and perfect for our needs. The neighborhood and building are quiet, and convenient for walking downtown. The space itself is great for a one or two people (preferably a couple or two very close friends) and we appreciated the fun local art touches. "
6927016,42583496,2015-08-14,28996245,Caitrin,"Very easy to get keys out of lockbox, directions and instructions very clear. Also Elena's guide has great suggestions of local favorites and things to do! Apartment was clean and perfect for the overnight. Our stay was a bit warm as there is no AC and we came on an unusually warm night for Seattle but regardless, would stay here again."
6927016,43119445,2015-08-17,15741813,Margaret,"Elena, although I never actually met her, was a great host! Very quick response time to all my questions. Very flexible. She arranged for a parking spot nearby which came in handy since there was construction on the street the apt was on. 

I wish we had stayed longer to take advantage of the cute little kitchen with all the amenities. The razors came in handy when I realized I had forgotten to bring mine! The bathroom essentials were great. She even had the same lotion I use at home! 

The apartment was clean and tidy. Everything as described. Walls are a little thin but that's to be expected in such an old building. The neighbors out back happened to be partying till after midnight the night we stayed but we were so exhausted that we fell asleep quickly. 

I'll keep this studio in mind for my next trip to Seattle for sure. 

Great first time Airbnb experience! 
"
6927016,43388601,2015-08-19,38086398,Ashley,Elena's attention to detail was impeccable! Charcoal for the grill️ toiletries️ reusable shopping bags️ and the list goes on and on. The bright and cheerful studio felt like home. We hope to stay there again when we come back to Seattle!
6927016,43956788,2015-08-23,28573428,Kevin,"Very nice studio apartment. Perfect for one or two people. Very close to the main strip with all the bars, restaurants, etc. and a nice change of pace from Downtown Seattle."

She even had a book of nearby restaurants, bars, and activities that definitely helped.  The location is great an within walking distance to a lot!  I was able to find the area easily and felt very safe and at-home while there.  I left wishing it was my apartment.  Thanks, Elena! "

Convenient places to eat nearby along with a grocery store a couple blocks away.  Fairly priced, would stay at again for sure!"
6927016,45637972,2015-09-04,42942690,Nadine,"The studio was adorable! I am a local Seattlite that used airbnb for the first time for a short little staycation. Elena's guidebook for the area was spot on, some of my favorites were included so it was sweet to see them in her book :) It was such a bright and happy apartment, very clean too!! Thank You!!"
6927016,46438332,2015-09-10,15546255,Christa,"I enjoyed staying in this cute, clean and comfy studio. Elena has thought of everything. Great to have all the necessities plus available if needed. About a 20 min walk to Pike Place market area but also only one block to bus line. Having a parking space available during our stay was key as parking is very tough in that area. Awesome rooftop view. Accurate description of apt. As noted, it is an older building and was a bit noisy. I used ear plugs at night and was fine. Did not have the pleasure of meeting Elena but she was easily accessible for questions. Would definitely stay there again "
6927016,46718584,2015-09-13,22633956,Isabella,"Place just as described. Sunny, pleasant, central. I'd stay there again."

She even left us with great recommendations to do around the city. The apt itself is very cozy and homey. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a relaxing time in a fun neighborhood in Seattle.

6927016,48542377,2015-09-27,38494029,Benjamin,"Elena's studio was perfect for our stay on Capitol Hill. I lived in the neighborhood years ago and the studio is in a great part of town for exploring Capitol Hill's restaurants and bars, day or night. The studio was cute and tidy and perfect for retreating to after our busy days out exploring."

6927016,49384141,2015-10-03,1873732,Melissa,"Great location and very easy to find. Elena makes arrival extremely easy and convenient. Her home is beautifully decorated and true to the Seattle art scene:-) great experience overall.

The only disclaimer I'll add is that we arrived around 10pm at night and couldn't find parking for nearly 45 minutes (but that could've been b/c we were there so late),"
6927016,49607016,2015-10-05,33110998,Kelly,Great location.  Cute and cozy. Perfect for those not spending a lot of time on the property. We loved it. Would definitely stay again! 
6927016,50214578,2015-10-10,27171135,Mary,"Really nice place to stay in Capitol Hill. Walls are a bit thin so you will hear neighbors + things outside. There is a light in the parking lot outside the window that never turns off. Neither the light or the noise bothered us at all - just things to consider. The bed was super comfy but pretty small, luckily we are small people. Loved the art and plan to contact the artist :) Overall we enjoyed our time here, plenty around to eat within walking distance, and felt safe. Thanks! "
6927016,50442761,2015-10-12,4895573,Jeany,"Elena's place was incredibly cozy and just perfect for our stay. Clean and fully stocked with everything you could need. It's located a short walk's distance away from where everything happens in Capitol Hill.

Elena herself was a wonderful host. She was communicative and friendly and ready to come by and help if we needed anything. I would definitely recommend staying at Elena's if you're visiting Seattle!"
6927016,51170950,2015-10-18,33682299,Elayna,"Had a great stay at Elena's studio apt in Cap hill.  The apt is right in the heart of Cap Hill with lots of bars, restaurants and coffee shops to explore.  It was a nice stroll or bus ride down to Pikes place market and the waterfront. Would definitely recommend this place for a stay! She had some great suggestions of what to do, which was really nice. "
6927016,51624567,2015-10-22,41502647,Laura,"Elena's apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle - walking distance to lively bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill, but in a quiet location on a safe street.  The apartment itself is gorgeous, as well; I loved the quirky vintage style of the building, plus fantastic art and lovely touches really made us feel at home.  The bed was absolutely heavenly after a long day of exploring the city on foot.   This was our first air bob experience, and I couldn't have asked for a better host; Elena made it painless and pleasant and was very responsive when I had questions.  "
6927016,51755892,2015-10-24,22656386,Mahsa,Wonderful stay! Such a cute apartment and amenities. Everything was perfect and great location. Thank you! 
6927016,52079060,2015-10-26,3528685,Nieka,"Thank you Elena for a great stay!  Great communication,  super clean and cosy little pad.  We were luck enough to find a spot to park out front and we just walked and took cabs everywhere we went.  We brought home pastries from bakery nouveau one morning and ate breakfast in.  Elena stocks great tea and coffee if you don't want to leave your little nest.  This was a great spot for us!"
6927016,52592198,2015-10-31,8304652,Marissa,Elena was a fantastic host. She responded promptly and was very accommodating. The apartment was perfect for a short stay in Seattle and in a great neighborhood. Highly recommend!
6927016,53110522,2015-11-05,40731741,Jacquelyn,"The apartment was in a decent location and it was easy to walk to restaurants and bars and just as easy to drive to others. All would have been fine had t not been for the loudness of the building coming from all directions. The walls really are paper thin and the apartment is on the first floor so people were out in the courtyard it faces and it felt like they were in the apartment with us. Also, it meant keeping the shades down most of the time so it was quite dark in the apartment. "
6927016,53410638,2015-11-08,36637707,Vanessa,"Elena was a wonderful host with a beautiful studio apartment. She was available when I needed her and helped me get Settled in. Her studio has everything  you need for a trip, with extras just in case. She went above and beyond what I expected, and would love to stay here again should I visit Seattle again. She made my first experiences with Airbnb a smooth and easy experience.  "
6927016,53620692,2015-11-10,25758407,Shannon,"Loved Elena's place. Super cozy with all of the amenities of a hotel. The local artists work on the wall was an awesome added touch. Super close to bars, restaurants and stores, but still had the local at home feel that my husband and I were looking for. I'd defiantly recommend staying at her place. Plus, she is super cool and down to grab a drink with you if you want. "
6927016,54057597,2015-11-15,48533184,Aubrey,"Elena was very responsive and accommodating with our last minute reservation and stay. The studio was bright and cozy with vibrant decor, well-stocked amenities, and a fabulous tea selection- exactly what we needed for our short stay in Cap Hill! Convenient off-street parking spot was available, and the studio was centrally located for Cap Hill exploration and fun! Would love to stay here again and would refer others here, too!"
6927016,54241649,2015-11-17,12972324,Rowena,"Elena's place was perfect!  My friend and I stayed here with hopes of exploring Seattle and all the touristy spots. Elena had a handbook full of suggestions and the house rules.

She also provided extra amenities for comfort.  Being from California... it was just warm... perfect temperature for us.  We loved all the original artwork on the walls.  It just gave us the perfect Seattle vibe.  We especially enjoyed her wonderful tea collection and all the amenities provided in the bathroom.  The decor was just awesome, the place was clean, and the bed was so soft... great to sleep on after a full day of walking around downtown.  The place itself is close to a lot of bars in Capitol Hill and very close to a few shops right along Broadway.  I would love to stay here again.  "

Beautiful decor. Well equipped. Had a fine selection of teas which we didn't have time to enjoy but would've loved to. 
There was a welcome book on the dresser waiting for us with a guide to the apartment, the neighborhood, and some recommended places to visit around town! "
6927016,55271862,2015-11-29,5462230,Jenna,Elena was very professional and wonderful to rent from. I look forward to staying at one of her Air B&B's again soon.  
6927016,55497750,2015-12-01,104934,Craig,"Caitrin and I had a truly wonderful stay at Elena's apartment. Elena made us feel very welcome and answered all of our questions. The place is really cute, warm and tidy - perfect for a weekend get-away or even a place to rest for a week or two! Thanks Elena - we hope to come stay with you again :)"
6927016,55737443,2015-12-05,39568083,Liz,Awesome amenities!
6927016,56227463,2015-12-10,32212189,William,"Super cute and funky little apartment. The art was super cool and the kitchen and bathroom were incredibly well stocked. With a code operated lock box, we were able to get and return the keys totally on our schedule. We had a great time."
6927016,56327623,2015-12-12,22245422,Rhion,"Needed a place to stay while visiting my son, a student at Cornish. The studio was cozy and quaint. I felt completely at home. Elena made every effort to make sure I was in and comfortable. Great amenities. Could have asked for a more perfect location. I'll be booking again in the spring. "
6927016,57039937,2015-12-21,5309983,Philip,Elena's place was nicely located and had lots of amenities. The guide for the area was also very helpful. 
7025898,38045643,2015-07-12,36010205,Neel,"Accommodations were great.  I sent 4 people to Seattle to work for the week and Andy did everything he could to make them feel at home.  Very good experience, we will use him again in the future. "
7025898,39228093,2015-07-21,23661364,Juan Sebastián,"The House is exactly as described and the neighbourhood is great!

The hosts were very nice and even left us a bottle of wine. Would go back when I am back in Seattle!"
7025898,39982188,2015-07-27,15563028,Simon,"Andy's apartment was perfect for what I needed. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome, and help out whenever he could. This kind of service is what makes AirBnB work so well."
7025898,42152970,2015-08-11,37146964,Arnaud,"Le logement correspond parfaitement à la description. Andy fut un hôte chaleureux et son accueil a été personnalisé. Il fut simple, rapide, pratique. Le quartier est calme, agréable avec des restaurants de qualité à faible distance, la plage de Madison Park sur les bords du lac est un secret bien gardé et est accessible rapidement...
Ce séjour fut un vrai plaisir! "
7025898,42491570,2015-08-13,41013172,Neil,"Well, my wife and I are Airbnb newbies and let me tell you, what a great first experience this was. I was looking for a place to stay in Seattle and the hotels are crazy pricey this time of year. I started looking at other options and stumbled upon Airbnb. I selected the search area I was intersted in and Andy's place was one of the listings that came up.

I quickly registered and contacted Andy. We were looking for same day accommodations and it turned out Andy was at the airport about to leave on flight. He went extremely out of his way to make this stay work and we really appreciate it.

The accommodations were exactly as described  and the price was very reasonable. The location of the condo is great for accessing Seattle's major tourist attractions. It is just a short drive to Pike Place Market, The Space Needle,  EMP, SafecoField, etc. 

The neighborhood is quite cool as well. The kids and I went on a date one night and ate at a cool little restaurant just around the corner called ""The Harvest Vine"". There are plenty of unique restaurants that are in easy walking distance of the condo.

If you chose to stay here you will know exactly what to do in the area because Andy and his wife Lynne have prepared a well written tourist guide to Seattle. Their guide not only details the well know attractions in the region, but also dives right down into the shops and restaurants in the local neighborhood. It was most helpful.

All in all it was a great stay and first Airbnb experience. The key to making it great was how accommodating and well prepared Andy and Lynne are.

Highly recommended.

Neil and Nadine"
7025898,42935360,2015-08-16,38692856,Joey,"Andy and Lynn are very nice and friendly. They got us a bottle of wine for me and my family. The apartment is set up spacious and tidy. A private parking space is also available in the garage. When we have an issue, Lynn was so helpful and responded very quickly. the neighborhood is quite and nice. My family had a pleasant stay at the apartment."
7025898,44025122,2015-08-23,41060931,Lora,"     Andy and Lynn were great hosts!  Once we booked the rental, they welcomed us with a prompt email about our stay, a bottle of wine upon our arrival, and smiling faces when we met them in person a few days later.  We were in Seattle for medical purposes and Andy went out of his way to be very sensitive and thoughtful of our situation.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a little anxious that it may not feel safe or that we wouldn't be completely comfortable with the owners.  Andy and Lynn were the ideal hosts and immediately put us at ease.  
     The place was just as I anticipated it would be from the pictures and description.  It is a very basic place without frills but it had everything we needed.  
     The neighborhood felt safe and was very convenient to everything, even within walking distance to several shops and restaurants.  We went on several walks around the neighborhood in the evening with our kids.  "
7025898,45413741,2015-09-02,31247467,Ryan,Our stay in Seattle was stress free in part thanks to Andy. He made sure we had everything that we could need for our stay so that we could focus on showing our game at PAX Prime. We will definitely book one of Andy's properties again.
7025898,46249109,2015-09-08,24245651,Kaitlin,"Andy made our stay feel like a 5 star hotel! We decided on a super spontaneous weekend trip to Seattle to celebrate a birthday, and luckily I found this place available. Andy communicated with me so well about every single detail and left nothing to chance to ensure our stay was amazing. He even left a birthday bottle of wine! The place was spotless, comfy and cozy. Couldn't imagine a better experience!"
7025898,46677196,2015-09-12,6046725,Merlin,"The place was perfect. It was on short notice for an a sad visit, and Andy took every care to make it comfortable and painless. Its a very nice central neighborhood thats close enough to everything while providing a nice little escape, being tucked away on a pretty sidestreet. Thanks Andy!"
7025898,46983456,2015-09-14,42501426,Laura,"Thanks, Andy! Our group felt welcomed, at home, and we found everything we needed at your place. We would definitely stay here again. "
7025898,48746890,2015-09-28,14723745,Matthew,"The apartment was exactly as advertised--great location, clean, plenty of space for six people--but the kicker was the exceptional hospitality. Andy was very considerate. I wish I could say the same about all of the groomsmen ;) Thanks, Andy"
7025898,49147784,2015-10-01,42931599,Niklas,Very kind and pleasant host. Early check-in went smooth. Comfortable beds. Big living room. Nice neighborhood. Large balcony with a beautiful view in the valley. The only improvement that comes to my mind is to maybe add some pictures on the walls.
7025898,55234919,2015-11-29,11101951,Sue,"I got the 2 apartments on the top floor of the Thomas Lodge for relatives in town for Thanksgiving.  Andy was such a great host!  We were the first ones to use the recently renovated apartments, so I got to see both the before and after.  What a transformation!  A perfect spot for overflow guests.  Very comfortable furnishings and well-stocked kitchens.  It gave us two extra kitchens for food prep, making Thanksgiving for a large crowd easy and fun for everyone.  Very nice and quiet neighborhood with easy parking, but still close to restaurants, groceries, etc.  Andy had a welcome bag full of goodies along with a nice bottle of wine in each apartment.  I and the relatives will be return customers for sure! "
6923948,40795922,2015-08-02,19066237,Chelsea,"Ingrid was a great host and the house is just as wonderful as it looks in the pictures. The neighborhood is so adorable, one of my favorites in the Seattle area. She gives some good restaurant recommendations and things to do in the area, but the house is also a great place to hang out -- has a ping pong table, a jacuzzi, great lounging areas, and is plenty big. She also had a little basket of goodies waiting for us when we got there which was so sweet and delightful to start the trip. Highly recommend!"
6923948,41411461,2015-08-07,5820259,Noam,"We were delighted by the house and how welcomed we felt before, during, and even after by Ingrid. 

The house is spacious and comfortably hosted 4 of us. The house really has everything, ping pong table, hot tub, bbq, deck, stereo system, and lots of room! (we also got a bag of sweet coffee from Ingrid as part of the welcome packet!)

The location is ideal. Close to everything (we walked everywhere!) restaurants, coffee, parks, it's all close by.

Neighbors were super chill and even popped in to help out with a lost item.

Would DEFINITELY recommend and I'll probably be back with my family and some point ;)"
6923948,41780646,2015-08-09,29243182,Aaron,"Ingrid was a fantastic host.  We didn't get to meet her during our stay, but were aware ahead of time she wouldn't be around.  Myself and 6 friends stayed in the gorgeous house.  We received a pdf of instructions/how to operate the home before our arrival.  

The location was perfect.  Just a few blocks from the main drag in Fremont with tons of access to bars, restaurants, coffee, and groceries.

I would highly recommend Ingrid to anyone else looking to stay in the more quiet, yet hip Fremont neighborhood.  
"
6386210,33323330,2015-05-26,33656881,Trixi,"Staying at Karen's house was a wonderful experience. Karen's family made us feel very welcome. The house is comfortable and beautiful in a very nice neighbourhood. 
My first Airbnb experience couldn't have been any better.... I highly recommend staying here. I will be happy to come back if Karen will have us."
6386210,37324693,2015-07-06,24323072,Naomi,"Staying in Karen's home was an absolute joy.  Karen is a phenomenal host--we arrived to a lovely welcome basket full of treats, and throughout our stay she continually checked in to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. The house is just as described -- large, beautiful, and comfortable, with a gorgeous backyard. We took advantage of the yard to grill dinner one evening, and made s'mores around the fire pit. It's really an incredible place to stay, especially for folks visiting Seattle with a larger group."
6386210,38135754,2015-07-13,19471868,Brooks,"Karen was so accommodating, we were traveling with my infant son and my parents. She was a great communicator and we just had an amazing weekend in Seattle. Their house is beautiful, warm and just was a really great experience. I think Karen definitely goes above and beyond for her guests."
6386210,43373643,2015-08-19,13192163,Ann,"We'd never been to Seattle before this trip, and Karen and her family could not have been more helpful or welcoming. Our emailed questions ahead of time were answered quickly and with lots of helpful info included, and our arrival at the house was met with warm notes from the family along with a basket of yummy treats! The house itself was immaculate and so comfortable, and in such a convenient location - a bit out of the downtown fray but only minutes to all the great neighborhoods. There's a really nice market and coffee shop a block away, along with the Arboretum, which was the perfect running/walking spot. We would definitely go back, and recommend this listing highly to anyone considering it! "
6386210,44169616,2015-08-24,39646181,Nicole,Karen's home was beautiful and absolutely perfect for our girls weekend in Seattle. The home is stunning and very clean. Karen was also wonderful to work with. This was my first time using AirBNB therefore Karen's reach ability was extremely reassuring. 
363064,16802519,2014-08-02,3245906,Kimmo,"Lena was nice to receive me despite very late hour as my plane landed late.  The flat is actually nicer than in the pics so I was pleasantly surprised. It is modern and well equipped. The portable wifi gadget was very useful for a traveler as I could carry it with me in the city and had access to the web. The location of the house is convenient and within walking distance from downtown attractions, nice restaurants and of course the Space Needle. Also grocery stoors and the Olympic Statue Park is near by. The neighbours upstairs have squeky floors as Lena has written so if you are a light sleeper wear the provided ear plugs. I did not need them. The house may look a bit scruffy from the outside but the corridoor and flat are nice."
363064,17319898,2014-08-10,7238818,Sandra,"Lena was a great host.  I had a chance to meet her the night before over a drink and she gave me some great insight into the area.  The day I checked in, she gave me a run through of her apartment, had a binder of info about the Seattle area and a map waiting for me.  Her apartment is located half a block from the bus stop which made it super easy to get around.  I would definitely recommend staying at her place!"
363064,19285717,2014-09-09,16020624,Jason,Lena was very friendly. The location is convenient and the apartment was clean. It had everything that I needed. The LCD projector was a huge plus! I would stay here again.
363064,20677019,2014-10-03,7469357,Katrina,Lena's apartment is in a great location. Cosy studio with everything you need. I loved that I could walk to the supermarket and coffee shops in Lower Queen Anne. Lena is a fast communicator which made planning my stay very easy. Thank you Lena.
363064,22480763,2014-11-07,10572805,Siobhan,"Lena's studio apartment is a great spot for a Seattle break or if you are here on business. The space is ideal and well equipped - everything is modern and very clean. The location is perfect and as a lone female traveller I felt very safe here. Lena went the extra mile to make sure I had everything I needed, even including a little portable wifi device - ideal for a foreigner! Will definitely come again if I visit Seattle. "
363064,22567401,2014-11-09,445466,Sara,"Lena's apartment is wonderful. I had a very lovely stay and her apartment was much more comfortable, modern, and spacious than a hotel in my opinion. Perfect space especially if you are a single traveler. Lena is very helpful and friendly and I would definitely stay here again! "
363064,23459193,2014-12-01,23527410,Emily,"I had a wonderful one week stay at Lena's apartment. Although Lena was out of town for the check in process she kept in very good communication with detailed instructions, check-in was a breeze.  Lena also kept in touch throughout the stay to make sure everything was going fine.  The apartment was clean and cozy with everything I needed for a short stay.  Great location for easily exploring Seattle and within walking distance to groceries and restaurants!  Great Internet connection as well.  Would definately stay here again, thanks Lena!"
363064,24421805,2014-12-28,23820966,Karen,"I had a wonderful stay at Lena's studio. Lena was out of town during my stay, but she kept in constant contact and make sure everything was going smoothly (even though she was on a different time zone). 

The neighborhood is very close to the Space Needle and Museums. Its a great location for busing. There are plenty of choices for food a short walk away. The internet device that Lena uses for her apartment is perfect for looking up directions or bus routes using a smart phone since it is portable. I would suggest bringing a portable power bank if you plan on using it a lot since it has a short battery life. I would love to stay here again."
363064,25283352,2015-01-11,17549990,Peter,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Lena's flat. The location is excellent, being near the Space Needle and within walking distance to everywhere in downtown Seattle. Lena was on top of it all, giving me instructions on how best to reach the flat from the airport and making sure everything was in good order. The flat is located in an apartment building which is safe and has polite residents. I highly recommend Lena's flat if you are looking for a place to stay in downtown Seattle."
363064,26480710,2015-02-14,16916768,Matt,"Lena has a really well organized and clean home, and she is very friendly and responsive to any questions I ever had.  She provided great advice on what to do in her neighborhood, and generally made me feel very welcome.  I would absolutely stay again given the chance."
363064,27283058,2015-03-01,16916768,Matt,My second stay at Lena's apartment was as great as my first.  Lena continues to be a friendly and responsive host despite her busy travel schedule.
363064,27723181,2015-03-10,13202149,Alyson,"Lena's studio was exactly what I was looking for: cozy, comfortable, and conveniently located. I was in the city visiting friends, and it was a great spot to ""come home to"" each night. And Lena was very responsive, checking in with me during my stay to make sure everything was going well. Check in and check out was easy. I will definitely keep this on my list for future trips to Seattle!"
363064,28283323,2015-03-21,28250867,Mike,"Lena and her place were both incredibly accommodating.  The apartment was cozy, cute, and welcoming.  Needless to say, the location can't be beat, either! You can walk to all of Seattle's famous hot spots.  Even more so, Lena was wonderful at staying touch and providing information.  She even went out of her way to provide information and assistance about a specific issue on my end.   Both Lena and her apartment made my stay an easy and enjoyable one! "
363064,28668541,2015-03-28,3738199,Heather,"I had a wonderful stay at Lena's home. It was very convenient to all the landmarks I wanted to see. A five minute walk to Seattle Center which houses the Pacific Science Center, Space Needle, the Monorail, EMP and the Armory. It is also about a 5 minute walk to the Olympic Structure Park which was my favorite part of my trip. 
The building is older so the floors creak and you can hear the neighbor above you walking around. However, the interior of the apartment is all new, clean and modern. I was very comfortable and I would definitely stay here again. "
363064,29037895,2015-04-03,4499728,Irene & Michael,"I really enjoyed my stay at Lena's apartment!  It was just as advertised, very clean and had all the amenities I needed for a great stay in Seattle!  Lena was easy to communicate with and available to answer my questions.  I would definitely recommend it to others and stay here again!"
363064,29438556,2015-04-07,16630266,Douglas,Lena's place was great. Conveniently located within walking distance of major Seattle attractions and good food.  Would highly recommend this to anyone traveling alone. Lena is a gracious host and quickly responded to any questions I had during my stay. 
363064,29621275,2015-04-10,29255472,Christine,"Lena's place is great. Nearby the needle, nice walk along 1st Ave into downtown, passing a lot of good food places. Parking free from 8pm to  8am. Lena answered all of my questions and I really recommend her home!! "
363064,29762061,2015-04-12,5340600,Alex,"The location was great, and most everything was great. The only issues I had was no ladder to the loft bed and the apt smelled of sulfer one day when I got back."
363064,30636154,2015-04-25,21658166,David,"Lena's place was perfect! Although I had some issues when I arrived (finding the keys!), Lena was always available to answer my questions and I think that this is the most important thing when you travel with Airbnb. The place is clean and includes everything you need (no iron if you have business meetings though!). Great area but if you have a car, you will have to pay a lot to park on the street. "
363064,31197612,2015-05-03,29449992,Lindsey,"I had a great time staying here! For one its a great location, only a few blocks from my office and central to most downtown attractions. The apartment was very clean. It was nice to have the kitchen to use. Really nothing bad to say! "
363064,31886069,2015-05-11,28337743,Elyse,"Awesome stay in Lena's studio. Great communication on check in and check out and suggestions for how to navigate to and from SeaTac. The studio was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Walking distance to everything. Loved it!"
363064,32519819,2015-05-19,30549163,Kylie,"From start to finish, Lena was a gracious and kind hostess to open her home to me! While I never met her in person, she was quick to respond if I had a question, and as a newbie to Air BnB, I had many! Absolutely a beautiful space, convenient to groceries, transportation, and the sites of Seattle. I would absolutely stay here again. Pictures are true to reality, everything is clean and spacious, bed was comfortable. The perfect place for a few days of downtime between business trips. "
363064,32961064,2015-05-24,5151491,Michael,"Fantastic place for exploring Seattle. The place is cozy, true to the pictures, and obviously in a great location. Pickup/Handoff of the keys was a cinch too! Would stay here again. "
363064,33583195,2015-05-30,10031669,Amanda,"Lena's place was great! The apartment was just as described, and Lena was very communicative throughout the trip. The best part of this AirBnB was the location. It's was walking distance to all the major attractions downtown. The one drawback is that the internet signal seems to go in and out, but there are coffee shops with wi-fi nearby."
363064,34166668,2015-06-05,27509113,Shaobo,"It's a good place, which is near to the downtown. You can walk to the lake or downtown, it's very convenient. I recommended it!"
363064,34457065,2015-06-08,25688417,Taylor,"Fantastic area. Right by the water. Walk over the pedestrian bridge and hang out if it's nice out. Bring running shoes -- you'll want to job :). Great host - everything was as promised, and there was even a little leftover milk in the fridge for my coffee. Definitely one of the best airbnb's I've stayed at. "
363064,34789753,2015-06-12,8143754,Paul,"This was a great place to stay in Seattle, steps to all the tourist sites of the city centre and close to lots of amenities. Lena was very helpful and accommodating, in touch with detailed instructions on how to pick up the keys and quickly responsive if I had any questions. Her place is exactly as the photos show, bed was comfortable and it was nice to be able to do a load of laundry. The amenities Lena left were perfect and I appreciated the binder full of restaurant recommendations."
363064,34942103,2015-06-14,571845,Michelle,"Lena's apartment was great! Awesome neighborhood close to everything but slightly removed from the chaos of downtown and touristy areas. The place was super clean, easy to find, and comfortable. 

The listing makes it clear the building is old and you might hear the neighbors. I wasn't prepared how loud it would actually be (music and footsteps), even after living in apartments myself for years. Luckily it was only one night of noise and I found some extra ear plugs available on the coffee table (thanks whoever left them!).

The only other thing to be preared for is the 'key cafe' pickup (where the house key is kept at a nearby cafe and you go there to retrieve it). While I like this concept in theory, after traveling nearly 20 hours, using public transit, and carrying heavy bags, the last thing I wanted to do was walk the .5 miles to get the house key. Same with walking back uphill to drop it off when leaving at 6 am and again carrying luggage. The key cafe pickup itself was pretty seamless (although they do encourage you to buy something from the cafe which seemed almost like an upsell) and ultimately it all worked out, which is what matters.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend the apartment and would book again!"
363064,43476394,2015-08-20,29475893,Ashley,"I used Airbnb for the first time with Lena and I'm glad I did! When I first started looking for apartments in Seattle, Lena's stood out to me the most. It was almost too good to be true based on the decor, layout, amenities, and location. When I reached out to her, I received an immediate response. Within a few days, I booked the apartment.

When I arrived, I didn't know anyone in the city or have a car. Lena explained what was around the area, how to use the public transit, and  recommended awesome places to check out. The apartment is in a safe area with easy access to Pike Place or waterfronts.

The apartment looks exactly like the photos. The futon is comfortable, the appliances work, and a decent amount of natural light comes through the apartment during the days (When Seattle decides to be sunny). If I was ever running low on anything, I reached out to Lena with a response in less then 15 hours. We Skyped and emailed back and forth without any issues.

I couldn't have asked for a better host or apartment."
363064,44305927,2015-08-25,4729939,Pilar,"For my first visit to Seattle, this was not a bad place to stay. It was a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle and a short walk to the waterfront. I found myself having to Uber around the city a lot, which was easy. This loft is exactly how it's pictured. I had trouble sleeping the first night because of the neighbors upstairs - which was a bummer because I was exhausted from the day/traveling. You could hear footsteps and it sounded like they were moving furniture in the middle of the night (2 of the 3 nights). If you're a light sleeper - I don't recommend, the building itself is old. Lena was super communicative before and during my stay. She was able to accommodate an early arrival which I was very thankful for. 
I would have preferred not to have to pick up and drop off keys at the cafe - just because it add times to your arrival and departure. It wasn't far from the loft but not fun carrying luggage around. The bathroom is very small as well as the shower. This place is perfect for one person or a couple. "
363064,44702315,2015-08-28,27128862,Marlon,"Lena made sure that I had everything I needed. Normally get the key through a cafe, but I was arriving outside the hours of operation, but Lena was still able to get me a key outside the normal avenue. Place is comfortable, very close to many places. Great place!"
363064,45247353,2015-09-01,17169095,Goran,"I have had a lovely stay at Lenas appartment. She was relly a good host and very helpfull. The Queen Ann area is very nice, only 20 min walk to Downtown Seattle."
363064,46754938,2015-09-13,41428778,Josh,"Hayoung was a fantastic host! Her place was tidy, in a great location, and she was very communicative. The place is exactly as pictured. As others have mentioned, the neighbors and city outside can be a little loud at night, but everything within her control was perfect. If you're in Seattle by yourself and possibly one guest (it is tiny but cozy) and this place is available, I would recommend reserving it before someone else does!"
363064,47150511,2015-09-16,10329933,Tessa,"Lena was so friendly and helpful, and made sure to keep in touch during my stay in case I needed anything. The studio is a great space, with modern appliances, and in a wonderful location. I couldn't have asked for a better stay in Seattle!"
363064,47771046,2015-09-21,31383718,Jongchul,"Fantastic studio, great location. Amenities and appliances were perfect and she was very helpful. Best ever."

호스트인 Hayoung은 도착 전부터 Seattle을 떠날 때까지 여러 차례 연락을 하며 불편한 점이 없는지 신경을 써 주었는데, 특히, Hayoung이 한국인이라 한국어로 연락을 주고받을 수 있어 너무 편리했습니다.
Hayoung 덕분에 한국인 친구 집에 다녀온 것처럼 편안하고 즐거운 Seattle 여행을 하고 온 것 같습니다.
Thanks so much, Hayoung~"

I highly recommend it."
7452021,44019357,2015-08-23,40734146,Jason,"Eliza was a great host! She was there when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house, which is beautiful, gave us recommendations for cool places to visit in the area and even brought an iron over when I needed to iron a shirt for a wedding. She was also very accommodating with toiletries, towels, etc. AND a growler of her husband's homebrewed beer! You can't ask for much more than that. The neighborhood is great and super quiet. I hope we have a reason to go to Seattle again as this is where we will be staying again. So glad we were able to be her first ABnB and that we were able to stay with her for our first time using the service. Thanks again Eliza!"
7452021,44946619,2015-08-30,8919028,Margaret,"The house was so adorable! Loved the way they decorated their pad.  It was an easy 15 minutes away from the wedding location that I needed to be (Industrial District) and 25 minutes from the SEA-TAC airport via Uber. 

The house had lots of skylights so a lot of natural lighting came through.  The bed was super comfortable and we had full use of the house.  We didn't watch TV but there was Direct TV available.  Eliza was very easy to talk to - she replied quickly and offered great feedback and advice on the location I was heading to.  Upon arrival there was a cute welcome note, a guestbook that I signed in and mint chocolates!  Their home was so warm and inviting, I felt very comfortable with my stay.  Thank you Eliza, I will definitely book this house again when I'm back in Seattle!"
7452021,45861116,2015-09-06,26184789,Bo,"Eliza was so easy to communicate with and we enjoy staying at her house very much. When we checked in, we had a chance to meet her in person. She showed us around the house and introduced several good restaurants nearby. We also took a morning walk to the beach. It was such a wonderful experience. The house was tidy and cozy and looks better than the pictures. We will stay at Eliza's again next time."
7452021,46202785,2015-09-08,10093428,Bo,"It's been a great pleasure to stay at Eliza's. She was so nice and generous to us. This is our first time taking our 3 months old son with us for a trip. Eliza's house was perfect for us. The house has   a beautifully decorated nursery room and lots of vintage style furniture, which I like a lot. We will definitely go back there again if we go to Seattle next time."
7452021,46737675,2015-09-13,40327888,Laura,"Eliza was a wonderful host--very friendly, prompt with communication, and very helpful before, during, and after our stay! 
The house is wonderful--very comfortable and full of light. The neighborhood is amazing! We loved being so close to Lincoln park. We watched the sunset over the Olympics from a park bench just a stone's throw from the house, walked the trails, and played with our daughter on the beach. Just a short walk rewarded us with amazing coffee from cafe ladro each morning. I couldn't have been happier with staying here and hope to repeat it next time we're in Seattle! 
The only con I could name is the lack of wifi, but the price can't be beat! If you need a Seattle place, I would definitely recommend this one! "
7452021,49453532,2015-10-04,17001237,Josh,Blake and Eliza are wonderful people with a charming home. Fantastic hosts that go above and beyond. They also have a solid scotch collection!
1980395,10646640,2014-03-01,3478175,Mariel,"Jane and Roey were amazing hosts. From booking, and ever since, they were flexible and friendly. We got stuck a couple of hours away and had to keep pushing back our check-in time, and they were so gracious and patient. Really easy to get a hold of anfd great with communication. When we got there, they were extremely friendly and understanding, and Jane gave us a walk through of the space. They had a really helpful binder with all the information you could want about the area, the house, and check out. And they let us use the garage which was perfect for unpacking when it got a little chilly outside.

The space is gorgeous, very well-decorated, comfortable, clean, and in a wonderful location if you plan to go downtown during your stay. It's literally 5 minutes from the highway, but completely secluded and there's no noise from cars or unsightly views of traffic.

The house itself was so comfortable and clean, we really wanted to stay another week! I would highly recommend this place, and thank Jane and Roey for their hospitality. We plan to rent this place again when we're back in the area."
1980395,11183766,2014-03-24,3120633,Kristin,"This is a fantastic place.  We were here with family for a long weekend, clean, quiet, really nicely decorated and well-supplied kitchen in terms of utensils, dishes, spices, basics etc.  They even provided a high chair and pack and play for our daughter.  It was easy to find, close to amenities, parks, and backs onto a private green space.  There is even garage parking.  Jane and Roey have exceeded our expectations.  We highly recommend.  "
1980395,14388583,2014-06-18,9523556,Rick,Jane was  so helpful to check in and make sure we had anything we could imagine.  We never met Roey.  
1980395,15046016,2014-07-01,182626,Carolyn,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Jane & Roey's townhouse! We were there for a family wedding and couldn't have found a more perfect place. Great location, super clean, comfy and our hosts were so helpful. We didn't want to leave!"
1980395,16744661,2014-08-01,15488176,Ziqian (Zoe),"Jane is a very friendly and easygoing host. My parents and I really enjoyed staying at her lovely, spacious and spotlessly clean house. It is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood only 15min drive to the heart of Seattle downtown. I absolutely recommend this place, the pictures didn't do it's justice! "
1980395,17498747,2014-08-13,10718954,Tracy,"Our host was very nice and met us upon arrival with the key.  She had a very comprehensive binder full of helpful information, including restaurant tips.  The place was exactly as described, and there was plenty of room for us and our 4 kids.  Kitchen worked fine for breakfasts and a few lunches or dinners.  It was very quiet with pretty views out the back windows over the creek.  Access to mass transit and the highway was easy.  Navigating the drive to the garage was quite challenging, but there was ample free street-parking.  Laundry was pretty loud, but we just made a point of not running it at bedtime."
1980395,18945680,2014-09-03,6096074,Carla,Awesome place to stay there were 6 adults. We stayed 3 nights while awaiting our cruise. Beautiful home great location so close to everything.
1980395,21204959,2014-10-13,20031156,Carol,The accommodations were very comfortable.  The neighborhood was very nice and the location was great for us.  There was a lot of information provided about the area and the home itself.
1980395,25022921,2015-01-05,1252435,Yulis W.,"Even though the weather in Seattle in December is pretty freighful, Jane and Roey' house is very delightful. It has plenty of rooms & toiletries,  warm fireplace on the first floor, great view of the outside. It was such a nice and wonderful holiday experience. We'll definitely comeback if we have the opportunity. Thank you Jane and Rory!"
1980395,33186673,2015-05-25,33169549,Yufei,"We arrived late and it took us some time to find the house. However, at the moment we entered the room, we all felt at home! The house is really warm, sweet and tidy. We can find everything we need(like dishes, towels, quilt) easily. Although Jane and Roey were not in town, they made us feel welcomed by every little detail. This is my first time using airbnb and I had a great experience. :)"
1980395,37035213,2015-07-04,20123411,Warren,"The neighborhood was fine as was the property.   It was comfortable and very clean.  We did not get a real chance to meet our hosts, but we are happy we chose this place to stay."
1980395,37580489,2015-07-08,6261883,Michaela,"The house was as described and everything was in good order.  
We did not meet the hosts, only communicated briefly on the phone.   "
1980395,39677202,2015-07-25,30470643,Mei,"房间太棒了，简直是一个惊喜。房间非常干净，物品齐全，应有尽有。第一层是客厅和厨房，厨房用品很齐全。二层是两个卧室，各有一个卫生间，卫生间都是干湿分开的。有洗衣房。非常喜欢这套房子。下次要是再来还会住这里，也强烈推荐大家租这套房，物有所值。That's great room, can do about it is a surprise. The room is very clean and a full range of goods, everything. The first layer is sitting room and the kitchen, the kitchen is a full range of products. The second floor are two bedrooms, each have a toilet, toilet is wet separate. There are laundry. Like this house very much . If the next time will come again live here, but also strongly recommend you rent the suite, worth."
1980395,46140587,2015-09-08,13673320,Bill,"Apart from a very nice welcome letter, we never heard from or saw Jane or Roey, but that was OK since we did little at their place besides sleep.  We didn't cook, so I can't comment on the kitchen equipment except to say that there is both a coffee pot and something you can use to make tea, neither of which we used.  (There is a nice espresso shop just down the street, which is where we got our caffeine).  The inside of the town house is pleasant, nicely furnished, and largely as described/shown on the website, although you have to wait until you get there to learn that there is no air conditioning (which fortunately we didn't need) and that the heat in the front room is broken, so you have to use the gas fireplace.  The furnishings most important to us -- the sheets, towels and bed -- were all very nice.  However, the master bedroom would be improved by a chest of drawers, and there were nowhere near enough hangers for 4 people.  Also, while there is a TV in the master bedroom, it is not connected to anything other than a DVD player.  Strange. that.  But overall, the place was pleasant, very clean and comfortable.

The one problem -- and it is a big one -- is access.  I could not recommend this to anyone who will be arriving after dark or is driving anything much bigger than a Fiat 500.  And a back-up camera is an absolute MUST.  The place is completely unmarked and invisible from the road at night.  The whole compound is surrounded by a 6-foot solid wood fence, and the entrance to the complex is an alley that looks like a dead end when you pull in.  We pulled into that alley twice and then backed out thinking this could not possibly be the right place.  Only on the third try did we pull all the way up to the fence and found that there was a right turn you have to make to get in and then a left turn before you catch your first glimpse of a house number.  And then, the next morning, you realize that the alley/driveway is far too narrow to turn around in, so you have to back out through those two narrow turns.  We would have parked on the street, but could never find an empty space.  There is a garage of sorts, but again, it is too small for anything larger than a Fiat 500.  We were driving a Chrysler 200 -- hardly he biggest car in the world -- and once we got that into the garage, we  couldn't open the driver's door enough to get out without climbing across the console.  We parked outside for the entire 4 days.  

Because of the access issues, I can only give the place 2 stars.  Apart from that, I would probably give it 4."
1980395,51696453,2015-10-24,11313614,Benjamen,"We spent about a week at Jane & Roey's townhouse. They provided great directions and information about the place. They also checked in on us to make sure we were o.k. and to get the garbage. They were great hosts. 

The pictures accurately depicted the place - actually that's not quite true. The townhouse was bigger than expected. The main master bedroom was huge with a walk-in closet, seating area, and two sinks. The second bedroom also had a large walk-in closet and good-size bathroom. Jane & Roey provided plenty of towels - enough for about 14 people or more.

There's a half-bath on the main floor. The pull-out sofa bed is an inflatable mattress, which my brother said was more comfortable than expected. 

The kitchen was a very good size. There were plenty of dishes, cutlery, and cooking supplies. The kitchen table easily could seat 8 adults. 

The internet and cable worked well for the most part, although there were times the WiFi was weak and not everyone's devices could connect. 

The shared parking area is very tight. Highly advise to just park on the street, which is free and you could usually find a spot close by. 

The location is quite good. There aren't too many amenities, but Safeway, Metropolitan Market, and Trader Joe's are within 1 to 2 miles from the townhouse. There are some good eateries around California and another street name that is escaping me right now. The townhouse is very close to the freeway, making it easy to get to downtown or anywhere else around Seattle.

I would definitely recommend staying here. Great place. Great hosts."
1980395,54604988,2015-11-22,636100,Thomas,"The place is perfect!  Well appointed and super well located.  Whether you have a car or not the location works well.  No car, the bus is 15 minutes to downtown.  Have a car, parking is available onsite.  The unit is huge and has all you'd ever need.  "

4701146,23933528,2014-12-14,4864923,Laura,"Barbie was an amazing host! We are so happy to have found her place, beautiful house. She was very accomodating, helpful and welcoming. Due to a family loss, I had to book a place at last minute for my husband and brother to stay and Barbie was patient and flexible with the check in time. I couldn't have been any happier with this experience!"
4701146,26496612,2015-02-14,14388437,James,"Great place in a quiet neighborhood. 

I came to Seattle to look for a new apartment to live. So I chose to stay at Barbie's place while during the search. 
The apartment is very spacious with an extremely large bedroom space. Everything you need is there. Settle is right down South with close proximity to the I-5. The apartment is located right below the host, but it has its own entrance with complete privacy. 
Barbie and her family are very gracious hosts. Plus, Barbie is also very knowledgable about chocolates and can give you more than a handful of places to go for some chocolate excursions. "
4701146,27773042,2015-03-11,27924228,Usama,Barbie & Roger were inviting hosts. They made sure we were completely settled in before leaving us to our adventures. The heated floor was a nice treat as it was slightly chillier here in Seattle than where we had come from. We would definitely recommend staying with them should you ever visit this part of the world.
4701146,28506789,2015-03-24,131977,Marcus,It was our first time in Olympic Hills! Barbie & Roger's sublet was just what we needed before we could officially move into our new place. Grateful for their hospitality!
4701146,28757353,2015-03-29,29832211,Laura,"Barbie and Roger were so friendly and welcoming!!  The apartment was actually larger than I expected.  Everything we needed was provided and, as a bonus, there was a theater room.  The house was easy to find and the neighborhood was safe.  We were close to everything!  I highly recommend staying here: the price was right, the location was great, and the hosts were incredible!  Barbie was so quick to respond and worked with us on our arrival time. "
4701146,29774149,2015-04-12,30068214,Katherine,"Barbie is an exceptional Hostess. Her attention to detail and cleanliness is worth mentioning. Her apartment made us feel very at home because of the extra touches she went to for our comfort. Extra pillows, blankets, kitchen items, comfy furniture and homey decor were all above and beyond what we expected. Barbie was friendly and accommodating while remaining respectful of our privacy. If we happened to have a request her response and action was immediate and discreet. The neighborhood was perfectly pleasant for daily evening walks and we enjoyed the proximity to amenities such as a cute German bakery and a few grocery stores. It was the perfect location for us to house hunt within a fifteen mile radius. Had we chosen to to utilize it, numerous options to pick up public transportation were within walking distance of her home and would have made getting just about anywhere a breeze. We will absolutely recommend this accommodation to friends and family in the future."
4701146,31246553,2015-05-03,19508022,Sean,"This space was exactly as described. It was clean and comfortable and made for a nice, affordable, and conveniently located base for a weekend on Lake Washington. Roger and Barbie were very friendly and available as needed. "
4701146,31861866,2015-05-10,823228,Sophia,"Much thanks to Barbie for a great stay! My brother and I really appreciated all of the small touches that made the apartment feel comfortable. From the fresh towels, bathroom toiletries, to the treats in the kitchen, it was wonderful to have a nice, clean home base while we were in town for the weekend. The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and safe. I especially loved that for a converted basement, the apartment gets a lot of sun. My mornings don't work right unless there's sun streaming through the windows and Barbie's didn't disappoint!"
4701146,32929526,2015-05-23,24335744,Feng,"We didn't actually see Barbie in person, her husband welcomed us and showed us around. It's a nice apartment with almost all the stuff you need, just as described online. Barbie is very responsive. She answered quickly and gave helpful suggestions. We had a good time staying here."
4701146,33750975,2015-05-31,31584915,Claire,"Barbie was very welcoming when I arrived, she showed me around and gave me some ideas on where to go whilst in Seattle.

Her place is exactly how it's described, very clean and comfortable. Close to local shops. 
Was a great few days and I would definitely return!"
4701146,34571300,2015-06-09,28481875,Brian,"This place was exactly as described. It was clean, comfortable and convenient.  Easy access to the Metro Bus. Barbie was very friendly.

4701146,34759706,2015-06-11,35259193,Olivia,"The bnb was clean, cute and in an awesome location! It had a washer and dryer, which we didn't use, but I thought that was super cool. We had a great couple nights and were extremely comfortable. Complete with bomb shelter, made into a snazzy little movie theater. Barbie was so sweet and courteous. I'll be keeping this place in mind for future trips to Seattle. Much more comfortable and affordable  than the hotels and motels that we went through on the days prior to finding the bnb!"
4701146,35310251,2015-06-17,2096555,Lisly,"Barbie was an excellent host.  The apartment was quiet, spacious and clean.  It is also within walking distance to a supermarket and a bus stop is around the corner.  It was an excellent experience and would not hesitate to stay there again."
4701146,38947825,2015-07-19,11154167,Björn,"Barbie gave us a warm welcome. The furniture of the apartment is a little bit old, but it is very clean and quiet. And it is affordable. The neighbourhood is good. So we were happy to stay some days here and can recommend it."
4701146,39783330,2015-07-26,5430650,Jose,"Great place to stay, located right next to public transportation so I had no problem getting around. Barbie was great and provided some awesome recommendations to get some chocolate, Indi chocolate! I recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle."

4701146,41233540,2015-08-05,37418686,Michelle,"This apartment is located in a cute little residential community in the northern part of Seattle, super convenient to I-5 and there's a grocery store right up the street. The private entrance is off the side of the main house, and the apartment itself is simply furnished, clean & cozy. Our hosts were welcoming and responsive. We managed to be there during ""record"" heat but the apartment stayed cool & comfortable. It was great to have a ""home base"" for exploring the city & surrounding area, and we'd definitely stay there again."
4701146,43844236,2015-08-22,40970929,Leslie,"Barbie made us feel most welcome; she anticipated our questions and showed us around the space, explaining anything that might make our stay in Seattle more pleasant.  She was helpful with information about the neighborhood, how to find running and walking trails, and the weekly farmers' market near the library.  Even though the listing stated  that there wasn't any wifi, she told us where we could find a place that had easy access, plus went the extra mile to get us connected whilst we were 'home'."

5308429,26442087,2015-02-12,27545051,Justin,"The place was super chill. I would totally be bros with the dudes. The parking spot was nice, the bathroom was uber modern and the whole thing was killer and well thought out."
5308429,26662737,2015-02-16,27646401,Hans,"Host was easy to contact and flexible on arrival and departure times.   Place was great, just as advertised.  So nice to be close to restaurants and bus lines straight to downtown."

5308429,27241447,2015-02-28,1814118,Amy,"Brian and his roommates made us feel welcome.  He gave us a tour of the upstairs suite with calm clean decor, amazing shower and heated floors in the bathroom(!).

We were welcome to use the kitchen, but with so many great restaurants, bakery's and coffee shops ( like Slate) nearby there was no reason to cook."
5308429,27599256,2015-03-08,1213025,Melissa,Loved the space and location! The host and his housemate were communicative and helpful. I would definitely stay in this space again! 
5308429,27866016,2015-03-13,29009052,Colin,"The room was huge and comfortable, a very good value compared to other places that I've stayed. Brian was a stellar host.  Very welcoming.  I would stay again anytime!"
5308429,27911751,2015-03-14,29238250,Terry,"Brian was very accommodating.  The upstairs floor is very new and spacious.  It fit all my needs. The stay was very pleasant and I'd choose this location again when needed. 
It was very easy to walk to nearby restaurants and stores. 
This house is close to downtown Seattle, Green lake, Greenwood, the U W campus, North gate, and downtown Ballard.  
This was a great experience.  Thank you Brian."
5308429,27984692,2015-03-15,3665768,Patrick,My stay with Brian was too quick. He was a generous host who shared many great tips about how to enjoy his neighborhood. He was also  flexible about my arrival and departure schedule.  I hope to return.
5308429,28065225,2015-03-16,27640249,Carly,"This was an awesome place to stay!  Brian contacted me a couple of times prior to my arrival which made my arrival smooth and easy.  The room was just as pictured, clean and spacious.  Brian and his roommates are kind, helpful, and an all around good time.  The location is perfect.  Walking distance to fun restaurants/bars but also a short drive/bus ride to anywhere is Seattle for the most part.  Would recommend! 
"
5308429,28441185,2015-03-23,27640249,Carly,Great second stay at this house in Ballard. Brian and his roommates remain nice and helpful. Room is private enough to feel secluded but main floor is open and welcoming. Hope to come back again soon!
5308429,35318668,2015-06-17,33755776,Joshatron316,"Brian is very helpful, accommodating,  and friendly.  Room was very comfortable.  A+"
5308429,35640887,2015-06-21,10229324,Andrew,Brian was incredibly welcoming and made sure we were ready for success within our trip. He was going to be on vacation after we arrived and made sure we knew who would be taking care of us afterwards. The living area was well maintained and incredibly comfortable. 
5308429,36120911,2015-06-25,28825497,Laura,"Our stay with Brian was perfect! Brian was out of town but his roomate Zack proved to be a fantastic host as well. Very cute upstairs living space, and the shower is amazing!! I highly recommend this air bnb! "
5308429,36415114,2015-06-28,15745268,Hannah,"Staying in this house was a treat! Although we didn't get to meet Brian as he was traveling, his cousin and housemate Zack was very welcoming and hospitable.  My boyfriend and I had plenty of privacy on the top floor of the house, and easy access to the kitchen, yard and laundry.  Their other roommate Noel, is friendly and helpful as well.  Zack was very accommodating with our arrival time and great at responding via airbnb messaging. 

The room itself is beautiful and very comfortable. The bed is better than the one I have at home, and the bathroom too! We visited during a warmer than usual summer week in Seattle, but the small standing air condition cooled the room well as long as we closed the window shades while we were out for the day.  While in the room, we would keep the bathroom door closed, especially after a shower, so the bedroom would stay cool enough. 

All in all it was a wonderful stay! A bit of a splurge for us at $115 a night, but worth it. "
5308429,36695021,2015-06-30,14198957,Sam,"Brian and Zack are really friendly and the room is exactly what they describe it, clean, modern and with all the facilities you need. The community is quite and clean as well. We would love to stay at their place again."
5308429,37170877,2015-07-05,33275573,Greg,"Exceeded expectations!  Great location in Ballard with easy access to public transportation to explore the city.  The upstairs private quarters was above an beyond our expectations.  The space was very clean, comfortable, private and Brian provided all the essentials with information on things to do around the city and how to get around.  

Brian was an excellent host and my wife and I enjoyed conversing with him and his cousin over a couple of homebrews.  We will definitely stay here again when we make our way back out to Seattle."
5308429,49899402,2015-10-07,28218572,Dana,Brian is an amazing host and makes you feel very welcome. He is very organized and easy to get communicate with. The top floor of his home is immaculate and has a lovely bathroom with heated floors and ample storage in the closet. There are also solar powered shades for the sky lights which make the room very dark for sleeping. The house is close to everything in Ballard and his welcome packet has a two page list of various restaurants and eateries for whatever you are in the mood for on any budget. Overall an excellent choice for airbnb. I would definitely visit again. 
5308429,58299350,2016-01-02,11215474,Gina,Brian was a great host! He went out of his way to check up on us and the room was just as described in the listing. We also loved the heated floors in the restroom. We recommend for anyone looking to stay close to everything in Seattle!
8095168,46223707,2015-09-08,19994652,Griffin,Great place in a sick neighborhood at a fair price -- nuff said. Didn't see Mike and Elise too much but they're awesome people with their own schedules and did everything within their power to make the place feel like home.

2610187,12672853,2014-05-07,14746654,Peter,"Had a lovely long weekend in Seattle, Melissa was a great host and was there to help with whatever was needed. "
2610187,17131715,2014-08-07,19140325,Sarah,"Great spot for the price! Melissa was a very good host overall. We searched Seattle for places to rent and this one was very well priced. With that said, do not expect 4/5 star accommodations. 
When we arrived we were skeptical because the outside looks less then desirable. But the inside was clean and a large space for a studio.
If you are planning to get around all of Seattle you will need a car for this place. Nothing special about this area, but we had day trips planned all around Seattle so that didn't matter to us.
If you want to stay in a trendier area with lots to walk to, this is not your place. If you want that you will also pay a lot more money. 
No A/C, which is fine for most Seattle days. We happened to be there on an odd week with days reaching 85 degrees. Melissa was very accommodating and bought us a fan. "
2610187,17535566,2014-08-13,19277052,Kris,A great place to stay. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Melissa was kind and helpful.
2610187,17792134,2014-08-17,3392039,Kate,"Great neighborhood and a really great location relative to bus stops and the parts of the city I wanted to visit. Had a bit of confusion getting into the unit and getting sorted as Melissa wasn't able to meet me there, and I would have preferred a bit more clarity in how check-in was supposed to work. Things were a bit out of sorts when we arrived, but a quick call to Melissa got that sorted out as she sent the cleaning guy over to handle things within 10 minutes. The bed was comfy, the view was great, and the place was nice and quiet. Overall, would definitely stay here again!"
3416590,15078785,2014-07-01,690724,Shaker,"Shannon and Carrie were such great hosts. The too was perfect, and I looked forward to getting breakfast each morning. Not only was it fantastic, but you also got to meet other guests. It really feels like home. "
3416590,16265148,2014-07-24,17561934,Maxime,"Excellent hosting that surpassed by far the traditional hotels of the same price range, and for far cheaper. The managers were awesome and the breakfast they make for guests every morning far exceeded my expectations. 

My only complaint was the lack of AC for a room that sat directly under the roof in the summer. A fan was provided and helpful though! 

In short: 10/10 would book a room there again."
3416590,17644013,2014-08-15,19135886,Rachael,"The neighborhood was amazing and the house is so close to an amazing part of Capitol Hill. The host provide just the right amount of hosting depending on the guest. Not overbearing, yet still attentive and great. "
3416590,20165473,2014-09-24,2530119,Nancy,"This had everything I needed.  Parking!  Breakfast! Quiet!  Everything was spotless.  I would definitely recommend it.  The bus goes right down Madison .  I had a wonderful visit with my daughter, a student at Seattle U. I would stay here again.  Thanks for everything."
3416590,29799898,2015-04-12,2811941,Chelsea,Great place! They had warm cookies sitting in the lobby and it was very clean. Felt like home!

3416590,35708173,2015-06-21,12878200,Andrew,"I was very happy with the location and the amenities were as listed, no surprises here.  There were a few more rooms/guests staying at the BnB than I expected, but was a very relaxing stay and i would recommend."
3416590,36236157,2015-06-26,32734364,Peter,"Amazing little b&b in a lovely leafy part of capitol hill. I stayed whilst working in the international district, great for getting the bus and really close to some nice restaurants and bars. The hosts were great and the earl grey was amazing at  breakfast time :)"

3416590,42697359,2015-08-15,4227058,Rod,"This a nice BnB in a great location. It is within walking distance to some great restaurants, bars, and cafes. The staff are both professional and friendly (actually, all the guests I met were pretty nice too). "
8687967,50137559,2015-10-09,13125335,Danielle,Kurt was an awesome host! Super welcoming and friendly and gave me guidance about what to do and see in the area. The space is in a great location. Fremont is definitely the place to stay in Seattle. I would definitely stay again!
8687967,51858305,2015-10-24,26132195,Matt,"Kurt had a simple setup with the standard but comfortable futon. Kurt was very excellent with communication, which is greatly needed between host and guest. If you're looking for reliability with a great location in Seattle, this is the place."
8687967,55045757,2015-11-27,28677253,Kevin,"Kurt was a great guy! he was very communicative when trying to get in touch with me. The amenities are all a traveler would really need in a stay, and the shower in his apartment was very relaxing.  He is also very passionate about music so if you are big on that, I would say to stay with him and you can have a nice chat. The only issue a traveler would have is just getting parking around the general area. If I am in Seattle again I would be willing to book with Kurt again. "
9714078,57065407,2015-12-21,7995431,Winter,"        With our first reservation on Airbnb, we feel lucky to have chosen Katherine’s house which is located in a quiet and peaceful community. The house is nestling under a mountain and near a river, which makes you fall in love with it at once. 
At the appointed time to check-in, Katherine was already in the house waiting for us. She is elegant and managed everything in order. In addition, she patiently explained every single function and usage of the house. During our stay, my family never encountered any problem making use of the house equipment and really enjoyed everything in this beautiful and cozy house. 
If you like the blend of grey, white and wooden color, then Katherine’s home is your No.1 choice. The rooms are very clean, with super-comfortable beds, soft yet tidy bed-sheets and bath towels. Each room is also equipped with luggage carriers and easy-to-reach closets. There is also a fireplace in the living room. Sitting around the fire, enjoying the Starbucks Coffee Katherine offered us is always my favorite part of the day. 
The most amazing part is the kitchen. A great variety of cooking equipment: those you can think of are out there, and those you did not think of are also out there. Katherine already prepared everything for you. The high-class table wares each counts as an artistic work and every meal in Katherine’s home is a pure pleasure. We stayed for 4 nights, transient but wonderful. They are the most unforgettable memories I have ever had.

The house was way bigger than we expected. The kitchen is open and connected to the living room making for a great place to hang out.  It’s a great home for a family or for a group of friends.  We slept 6 quite comfortably!

Green Lake is within 10-minute walking distance and was a great place to go running in the mornings! Plus there are tons of lake activities if you’re into that (paddle boarding, canoeing, fishing), and everybody looks happy! Even the dogs. Lots of coffee shops and cute restaurants close by.  

This was by far the best value we found on Airbnb for our Seattle trip as well. Thanks Amy for such an awesome stay and for sharing your home!"

2897897,15404569,2014-07-08,724775,Susan,"My family's 4 night stay (7 of us) at the ""cozy"" bungalow was awesome.  It was alot bigger than i imagined and fulfilled our every need. We also hosted other family members staying at other accommodations for two BBQ's out on the patio with a grill. The modern kitchen was very well appointed and we loved the openness of the living room from the bar between the two rooms.  We especially loved having coffee in the morning from the deluxe espresso maker ... so delicious !  My brother enjoyed playing the guitar and I the drum.  The large sectional couch in the TV room was very comfortable and spacious.  We thought the bathroom (only one)  would be a problem but everything worked out OK.  The house is in a safe neighborhood.  We enjoyed the special little duck pond across the street and also it's close proximity to Green Lake.  We attended my niece's wedding at Golden Gardens Park, another beautiful place to visit with outstanding views of Puget Sound and beach.  "
2897897,16083923,2014-07-22,15622351,Megan,Amy's house was a great value. It was such a nice and cozy place and was perfect for a girl's weekend in Seattle. We also liked that it had its own driveway and that it was a short drive from downtown I would definitely recommend Amy's house to anyone!

It's a pleasant walk down to Green Lake, where you can walk or run the 3 mile path around the lake if you need some exercise.

2897897,18798380,2014-09-01,1724046,Leigh,We had a great weekend staying here. Amy was very welcoming and the house was spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood was peaceful and a great jumping-off point for exploring other parts of the city. Excellent experience!
2897897,24516456,2014-12-29,5600298,Rebecca,"This was my first airbnb stay and I will do it again! Amy was quick to respond to my very last-minute request. This cozy bungalow is spacious and comfortable and very convenient to Green Lake, UW, Fremont and downtown Seattle is 10 minutes away. The modern kitchen is well-stocked for cooking, and the house is very comfortable for a family. A lovely alternative to generic hotel rooms with high-priced parking! I would recommend for families. Thank you Amy and Matt!"
2897897,25766278,2015-01-25,699251,Jessie,Thank you Amy and family for making our Seattle visit comfortable and giving us a chance to have family time together.

2897897,34312953,2015-06-07,7615717,Sandy,"My siblings and I had a wonderful weekend in Seattle and the interior of the house was pretty clean and modern. We had a car rental and there was plenty of parking space near the garage. We didn't get to utilize the kitchen, which was probably the nicest part of the home. We had trouble with the key and door when we were checking in, but after reaching Amy, we learned what to do. Knowing about the door  situation would have been helpful prior to checking in. (We understood once we read the house manual inside) Overall, communication with Amy was fairly quick and easy and the home was very nice. Also, Green Lake nearby was a great place to stroll!"
2897897,34946446,2015-06-14,26921903,Cyrus,"Enjoyed our stay in the Cozy Seattle Bungalow.  The house was easy to find, and Amy was good about letting us know how to get in.  The common areas and kitchen (which we used) are great.  The house was clean and well appointed, and in a good neighborhood.  I loved the patio (we had great weather, too).  There were two minor cons:  the shower pressure is not great, and the closets were all full so we couldn't hang our clothes.  Otherwise, great place, and a good value.  Would definitely stay there again."
2897897,35647887,2015-06-21,5148030,Mimi,"Had a bachelorette party in Seattle and rented out Amy's place. Plenty of space for 5 girls.

Saved about 25/night on parking! since majority of hotels in downtown charge for parking. You can take the inside road or freeway to downtown, we loved that. 

"
2897897,36479475,2015-06-28,6629259,Dan,I had a blast at Amy's apt.  It was very spacious and close to the 5.  About 10 min from downtown.  Her place was clean and it provided all the necessary amenities.  I would definitely stay again !
2897897,38846579,2015-07-19,33583179,Judy,"We were welcomed with a welcome sign, cookies, water and popcorn.  The home was very well maintained and clean.  The neighborhood was very unique and nice.  The home was located by busy crossroads which made leaving the home very accessible to where we were headed.  Communication with the homeowner was excellent."
2897897,39888169,2015-07-26,39360619,Judi,"Amy did a great job helping us feel welcome.  The home was clean,organized and had a great layout for family time together.  The neighborhood was easy to locate.  We went in and out of downtown Seattle and were always able to find our way ""home"". The home is in north Seattle and very easy to get to any of Seattle's tourist landmarks."
2897897,40479977,2015-07-31,29587862,Xuan,"Very great experience, I and my family stayed in Amy's house for 3 nights. It is a beautiful house, enough space for us. Also Amy left some food and drinks for us, let us feel like at home.

Everything is good, great location, close to green lake, only 10 min driving to space needle and downtown. 

We like to stay there next time when we get a chance. Thanks Amy."
2897897,42667805,2015-08-15,7534537,Tom,"Amy's house was the perfect location for our Seattle getaway. Our oldest son ran around Green Lake every day, and we felt that we had easy access to downtown etc. She stocked her home with breakfast items and treats to welcome us. The house had plenty of space for our family of six to spread out. The construction across the street was a bit noisy and  made it difficult to enjoy the beautiful patio.  All in all I would definitely recommend this home. "
2897897,44327336,2015-08-25,22961208,Carrie,"Amy was very easy to work with, the house was quiet and comfortable with a very nice patio. It easily held the 5 of us. The neighborhood was great, close to Greenlake and right off the 5. "

3868844,24929753,2015-01-04,21418378,Maenad,"What an amazing house.  It was perfect for our visit.  We are originally from the area and needed space to entertain friends so they didn't have to host the whole time.  Everyone enjoyed the house, we cooked for our friends, and played games and reveled in the views.  Judith was friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed spending time with Kiri, the cat.  My kids now want a cat as well as a dog.  We would absolutely stay here again, it was awesome being so close to Alki for my runs."
3868844,35316200,2015-06-17,33397506,Xinran,The house is amazing with breath-taking view. It looks exactly like the pictures. Judith is very kind and provided us with everything we needed. It's a spacious house with wonderful design. My family had such a great time living here. Kiri the cat is so adorable. The neighborhood has a Metropolitan market and the alki beach is a great place to take a walk. I would definitely choose this place to enjoy a vacation in Seattle! 
3868844,37459165,2015-07-07,11493083,Jonathan,"Beautiful home and the most incredible view (the pictures don't lie). Host is very communicative, accessible, friendly and warm. Quiet and safe neighborhood in West Seattle. Close to beach, parks, etc. Ideal for a couple or small family looking for a getaway."
3868844,39265882,2015-07-22,5308537,Brian Keith,"We loved Soundview Home! Sunsets are fantastic. Host Judith is a super cool lady. The West Seattle area is a great base for exploring the city, with the added benefits of the beach front and even an old growth park for hiking. I'd go back again tomorrow!  "

3868844,49125844,2015-10-01,41169460,Arthur,Judith is a delightful host. She showed around the house. Left for Vachon Island and checked in with us via text everso often to make sure we were comfortable. Only sorry we couldn't have had some time to share a tea or glass of wine with Judith.
3868844,51777503,2015-10-24,24932393,Brian,"Judith's Soundview Home is incredibly gorgeous. The reviews are spot-on and the pictures do not do this home justice -- it's amazing in person! The space is warm, welcoming, and it is underscored by Judith's hospitality and kindness. We were fortunate to meet and spend a little time with Judith and it made our stay in Seattle even more special. You cannot go wrong booking with Judith. Her home is a quick drive/Uber/ferry to downtown Seattle with the quietness and spectacular views you will not get elsewhere. We couldn't recommend this more. Thank you for a wonderful stay, Judith!"

Everything was tidy and neat and very clean.  The fire place was cozy for when we would come home at night.   Very secure entrance and neighborhood is cute and friendly.  Leo was easy to reach and super quick to respond if we had a question. We loved this place and will definitely be back the next time we're in Seattle!  He even left a bottle of wine for my husband and I who were celebrating our 5 year anniversary.  
1404307,22619434,2014-11-10,19455916,Mickey,"Great place to stay... Leo did a great job of keeping in touch with us before we arrived.

I recommend walking down the street to Judkins St. Cafe for a nice breakfast. "
1404307,24333594,2014-12-26,22465941,Steffie,"Leo is such a very great and cooperative host. We stayed at his cottage for almost one week with the 4 of us. The house is even better than our expectations as what we saw on the pictures. We had such a great time staying at his place and would want to stay again when we visit Seattle in the future. All is clean, maintained very well and the bed is very comfortable. "
1404307,24853279,2015-01-03,10135223,Tom,"Very clean and cozy cottage. The location is also very convenient, ~10-15 minutes drive to most places in Seattle. I really enjoyed this place and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. "

The house was very clean and the location was convenient to every where we wanted to go. Leo is very responsive to to emails and goes above and beyond to make sure you stay is positive. 
If you are 6 ft or taller you might find the shower a little low, since the ceiling is on a slant. "
1404307,34957915,2015-06-14,31286796,Kris,"Leo and his place were great.  Good communication throughout, excellent space.  Exactly what we were looking for.  Would absolutely check for it again on the next trip out.   "

Leo was especially flexible on some last minute timing adjustments, which is always greatly appreciated. He even bought an AC unit just in time for our stay during a heat wave. A perfect host."
1404307,40883639,2015-08-03,3074118,Molly,Staying at the cottage was wonderful. It is a very comfortable space with a fully stocked kitchen. A great location to downtown. The neighbors are very friendly and welcoming.
1404307,45081405,2015-08-31,12118377,Zachary,"Leo's home was very easy to find and enter. The photos are true to his space, and his apartment has all of the essentials. We had a great time!"
1404307,45941505,2015-09-07,3388597,Meredith,"Best hosts ever! Extremely warm and responsive. The place was beautiful and exactly as described (modern and clean). Would stay here again if we came back up. If you like to walk, the neighbors told me about a great path that lead to the Lake Washington. Every morning, I joined the other locals for a short hike to the bridge. So pretty."
1404307,56648796,2015-12-15,28376677,Victoria,It's one of my best Airbnb experiences ever. Leo is a really awesome and helpful host!

5174876,27738950,2015-03-10,25045152,Mesay,"We enjoyed staying in this studio. It’s located in central part of Seattle close to downtown and Broadway Street. Amble free street parking available.
The studio itself is very clean and as advertised. Plenty of light in the kitchen and sitting area. The bed is very comfortable – as good as a 4 star hotel. 
All in all, we were very pleased with the hosts and the place. Our demands were met in a timely manner. I would stay here again. 
"
5174876,27896938,2015-03-14,736236,Stanley,"First, the studio is absolutely lovely! Second, Miriam is fantastic. So friendly and accommodating. Whenever I come back to Seattle it'll be the first place I seek out."
5174876,28169100,2015-03-19,22139662,Ashley,"We enjoyed our stay here, very much. The place was exactly as we imagined, charming, comfortable and had all the necessities. It seemed as though the TV was hook-up ready, if you were to bring your own game console or dvd player but no actual cable TV or player was provided. (Side note: I am not entirely cable TV savvy, so user error is possible.) Our Hosts were absolutley wonderful and accommodating. We felt the location was perfect and parking was easy to find. There were so many local eateries in the area and a Trader Joe's down the street. We were just a few miles from Capitol Hill and Pike Place Market, etc. We left Seattle very happy guests!"
5174876,28280919,2015-03-21,21504067,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Miriam's for our first trip to Seattle. This was our first AirBnB experience. She was super helpful and very quick to respond to questions (even gave us great insights on places to see)! The studio itself it very private as it has a separate entrance into the unit. When we first walked in, we loved the inviting homeliness of the studio. It's very close to downtown Seattle (about 5-10 minute drive) so it's perfect place to stay for doing touristy things in Seattle. The bed is a little too soft for my taste but my girlfriend loved the soft mattress."
5174876,28656088,2015-03-28,27899211,Sam,The place was great; nice and new and conveniently located only a few minutes from a bus stop to get down town. It is also perfect if you plan on cooking a bit. The kitchen was well equipped and there is a grocery store just a few blocks away. Miriam was quite friendly and seemed readily available if anything came up. 
5174876,28740140,2015-03-29,3004560,Stephanie,Our hosts were lovely! We were greeted with warmth and the space itself was beautiful and as described/photographed. We'd love to visit again!
5174876,28990793,2015-04-02,2396162,Megan,"Miriam is an excellent host. This in-law unit is private with excellent light, nice outlook to landscaped yard, modern and well-furnished. Nice kitchen with fridge, full stove and oven, toaster, plates, glassware and such. Bathroom has a shower. There is a flat screen TV but you will need to bring your laptop and relevant adaptor for plugging into the HDMI cord to stream your TV shows or movies. Really nice couch, coffee table, and comfortable bed with nice linens and down comforter. Very clean (she uses a cleaning service which is nice). Also great that she has a filter water pitcher so you have cold water in the fridge. Bus #2 is two blocks from the house at 25th and Union. Takes you to Capitol Hill and also downtown. Parking is great in this neighborhood (we rented a car for one day to drive out to Snowqualamie Falls) and plenty of street parking. Miriam provides a french press, ground coffee, a few cream pods, two bottled waters, tea bags, and a few treats which is nice. Other than that, just salt, pepper and olive oil spray are in the kitchen - so if cooking is your thing you may want to grab what you need at the market. Safeway is about 6 blocks away on Madison if you want to stock up. Overall, we were very pleased with the studio and working with Miriam. Really easy to get key and leave key, stored bags for us due to flight times, and responded to texts and emails within seconds. We never got to meet Miriam as we were coming and going at odd times, but Jeff (her partner) greeted us to store our bags. They live upstairs in a very nice, cute home and we never heard them or saw them other than when he dropped our bags off. He was very nice. Great place and transit is close by. Sturdy walk to Capitol Hill. We did not mind; good exercise. Or just hop on bus #2. Awesome place to stay!"
5174876,29311050,2015-04-06,29078375,Tara,"We had a great experience staying at the studio.  The photos are exactly what you get when you arrive. We were excited when we walked in because the sun lit up the room from these great open windows that face the backyard garden. It was welcoming and it was easy to make ourselves at home. A better than a hotel for us. There was some complimentary snacks and water and if  you are really thirsty a Brita pitcher in the fridge and coffee!  Loved being close to downtown and in Capitol Hill . It was the perfect location for us since all the great restaurants , stores , coffee shops  and so much more wasnt too far away . Parking was never a problem. We would've stayed here our entire trip if we could've. Miriam was a great host and made things very easy for us and provided the necessities and was just a text away . We'll be back ! :) 
 "
5174876,29560814,2015-04-09,21068887,Katy,Terrific space. Very comfy and cozy. Miriam did a great job providing us with everything we needed and is even going to mail me some items I accidentally left behind! A+!
5174876,29855783,2015-04-13,2369443,Kevin,"I stayed here for two nights in April. The apartment is charming and clean. There's beautiful morning light that comes through the bay window. While this is technically a basement apartment, it doesn't seem like one at all due to the great light. The Bed is extremely comfortable. 

The bathroom is small and the toilet is a tad awkward, but it works. 

It is also very private, it felt very much like a private apartment. Miriam's residence is upstairs. We didn't see her. Although occasionally you can hear people upstairs. 

While there aren't a ton of restaurants or shops in immediate walking distance, there are a ton in very close driving distance. Great neighborhood in Capitol Hill very close to aforementioned restaurants, bars and shops. 

The one odd thing was that, despite listing the check out time as noon, a cleaning lady came around 11:40, while we were packing up. She was fine and it was no problem, but it did make us wonder if we'd gotten the time wrong. 

I recommend this location and would stay again.  
"
5174876,30113514,2015-04-17,31149398,Taylor,"Everything was absolutely lovely here! The studio was attached to the main house, but with a private entrance around back my boyfriend and I had our own quiet space. The kitchen, the comfortable bed, our own bathroom, the spacious couch--it was perfect for a mini getaway. Away from the immediate chaos of downtown, the studio was in a calm, yet still convenient part of seattle. Again, the setup was wonderful! And Miriam even left some snacks for us on the coffee table. "
5174876,30329267,2015-04-20,7011040,Moira,"My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Miriams studio. We were welcomed with some treats--chewy bars, mints, tea bags and more. The studio was bright with many windows and the view to the back yard was lovely.  The full kitchen allowed us to make breakfast daily and some snacks. We planned to cook more but filled up on the local restaurants.  The water pressure was great in the shower.  Very peacefull, the only noise was an occasional footstep.  Miriam responded promptly to a small request. 

The location worked well for us, we are walkers. We first walked locally in the area and found several restuarants and a great distillery. The next two days we walked all the way into down town, back to the studio once and took the bus back the other time. The bus stop is just 2 blocks away.  

We would gladly stay at the studio next time we are in the area. "
5174876,30475385,2015-04-22,30808626,Josh,Beautifully appointed loft with the most comfortable bed yet! We had a very relaxing stay in an awesome neighborhood. Very continently located to downtown Seattle :)
5174876,30533517,2015-04-23,10904997,Yohanes,I love my stay & it's very clean house .
5174876,30708290,2015-04-26,19902217,Sarah,"Very charming place! Cute backyard and beautiful view of Seattle from there. Bed was so comfy. Couches were comfy too. Great location, walking distance to bars and nightlife. Bus distance to downtown. We didn't have any face to face contact with Mirian but I'm sure she's great because we exchanged a series of emails that were very pleasant! I recommend staying here."
5174876,30940532,2015-04-29,26135198,Derrick,"Didn't have a chance to meet the hostess but check in and check out was very simple.  Communication was excellent and prompt.  The studio was very clean, cozy, and very close to everything.  You can drive up a couple of blocks and have great food.  About 15 minutes driving to downtown.  We were very satisfied with the place, it was very private and welcoming.  Next time we are in the area we would definitely stay again."
5174876,31202267,2015-05-03,22243042,Lupe,Very nice and clean. Walking distance to many shops and restaurants. Loved our stay there 
5174876,31410472,2015-05-04,30478458,Steven,"It was terrific, very nice and really enjoyed ... very nice people and great location.   Really made me feel at home, and love to do again!"
5174876,31516629,2015-05-06,36282,Tina,"The studio was just as described!  It's a lovely space that it close to all the great parts of Seattle, but a bit away from the hustle and bustle.   I really appreciated the space and had no complaints."
5174876,31887081,2015-05-11,4041610,Emilien & Lionel,"Ce logement est très propre, situé dans un quartier calme et très sympathique. Il est possible de stationner son véhicule dans la rue et plusieurs bus permettent de rejoindre le centre de Seattle, qui est assez loin à pied. 
Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de croiser Myriam mais elle nous a donné toutes les informations pour faciliter notre voyage."
5174876,32176701,2015-05-15,29791991,Janet,Our stay in Seattle was perfect thanks to the lovely abode provided by Miriam. Her studio was exactly as described. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds and made it difficult to leave each morning! The neighborhood is filled with amazing spots for food and entertainment and we walked all over the city with ease. I'd definitely book again.
5174876,32518040,2015-05-19,30479568,Ben,The space was fantastic. Miriam left us some water and snacks. The location is great. The studio is well stocked for anything you need and the bed is unbelievably comfortable.
5174876,32922954,2015-05-23,9164039,Qi,"This is an awesome apartment I found in Seattle, location is great which close to downtown, environment is cozy, clean, quiet & convenient. 
The host Miriam is a very nice & considerable person who can provide as much as possible support to you meanwhile she is really handoff which gives you enough privacies.  
This is a great experience for stay at this place, definitely will come again!"
5174876,33247728,2015-05-26,3955084,David,"Communication was easy with Miriam, we actually never saw her during our weekend stay. But we were given simple instructions and when we arrived we had some treats and bottles of water left on the table. The place was clean and spacious for studio type rental. As some mentioned the bathroom is a little cramped but we didn't mind. The rest of the place made up for it! We had a rental car so street parking was never an issue and uber was easy to get every night we went out. I would recommended this stay because it we a good location for the price!"
5174876,33510363,2015-05-29,3096388,Sheila,"Let me preface this review by saying my husband and I just recently did a weeklong road trip across the PNW and stayed across 4 different AirBNBs, with our longest stay in Seattle. Based on these stays, we’re reviewing and summing up the good, bad across our stays – what we liked, what we didn’t.

Miriam’s place was BY FAR, our favorite of the road trip, that there really is nothing “bad” to report!

- Apartment size /layout PERFECT for couple. Very nicely decorated, and so comfortable.  Lots of natural night. 
- Apartment has kitchen filled with dishware / cookware to make yourself feel at home. She has tons of plush towels, bathrobes, heater and snacks waiting for you on arrival + shampoo/conditioner.
- When we arrived, it was really chilly and Miriam was instantaneously responsive to turn up the heat. 
- Extremely easy checking in and out and felt free to come/go. 
- Easy to find street parking.
- Well located in Seattle and outskirts – an Uber to Pike Place was $9. 

I would absolutely completely recommend Miriam’s place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. I can’t say enough. 

We absolutely loved Seattle and definitely plan to be back – and when we do, we’re staying here! 
"
5174876,34009849,2015-06-03,32854472,Hanna,Miriam's place was as described and close to (website hidden) solace was very clean and well organized. We loved our stay and will definitely stay here again. Thank you so much Miriam!
5174876,34224807,2015-06-06,33230824,Chelsey,"Miriam's downstairs guest space was perfect for our multiple day stay. Not only was the private entrance easy to access, but the space itself was great - clean, bright, modern, and comfortable. I'd recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle!"
5174876,43756612,2015-08-22,32841859,Kristjana,"I live in the neighborhood and when my whole family came for a visit at the same time, we needed an extra room. I rented the studio for my mom, who loved it - said she felt ""like a queen"". The space is clean, bright and well appointed, and it's bigger than it looks in photos. Miriam was helpful and communicative.  Highly recommended. "
5174876,44405020,2015-08-26,29663883,Robert,"Miriam was very prompt in her response to all inquiries. She was very kind in getting us a fresh propane tank in order that we may use their grill. When we arrived there was a nice little layout of bottled water and snacks. With the windows open there's a lot of natural light that shines through and with the blinds drawn there's plenty of privacy. 

The house was very nice and the furniture modern. The internet was fast and met our needs. It was located in a nice neighborhood, walking distance to many shops and restaurants. A short walk (2 blocks) to the 2 bus will take you down to 3rd and Pike to go see Pikes Market. There was no issues with parking... we only used our car twice and the rest of the time chose to go with public transportation. "
5174876,44531349,2015-08-27,34675567,Nav,"Miriam has a wonderful space, it is edgy, creative and allows you to relax. It's perfect for any single/couples that are traveling. Miriam is efficient at giving directions and her responses are instant. A great home and host nonetheless."
5174876,45385842,2015-09-02,4775142,Mai Thi,"We enjoyed staying in Miriam's studio. It's very tastefully put together, very clean, and the bed was very comfortable! It was a wonderful place to stay during our 2-night trip to Seattle. It's not directly in the city center, but if you're an enthusiastic pedestrian like my boyfriend and I, you can get around by foot just fine (40 min walking to Pike Place Market), so we liked that. (Of course, there's always busses and uber.)
We parked our car on the street for free close to Miriam's house. 
We didn't meet Miriam in person, but she was very helpful both before and during the trip. She kindly let us checkin earlier than checkin time, because she knew we were arriving in Seattle earlier, and she left easy instructions on how to get the keys, so both checkin and checkout went very smoothly."
5174876,46266072,2015-09-09,15107553,Allie,We had a great stay at Miriam's place. The studio was exactly as described and was very cute and charming. Studio was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. We never had any trouble parking and the location was convenient as well. I would definitely stay there again. 
5174876,46507969,2015-09-11,41576764,Emily,"We loved staying at Miriam's place!  It was welcoming and cozy, and just as described. Miriam was responsive and hospitable, and made the process very smooth.  We also appreciated her being so accommodating when we asked to add an extra guest on short notice.  We highly recommend staying at Miriam's, it was great!!"
5174876,46745415,2015-09-13,30214921,Taekia,"Miriam's place was in a great neighborhood with easy access to transportation in to downtown Seattle. The place was exactly as described and very cozy and neat. It was my friend's first time using Air BnB and she couldn't get over how nice the space was. Although I never met Miriam, she was super nice and helpful when we communicated ahead of my trip, even going so far as allowing us to check-in a bit early since our bus from Vancouver arrived mid-day. "
5174876,47619037,2015-09-21,31868749,Michelle,Wonderful experience. It's in a great location and not far from downtown. My wife and I enjoyed walking everywhere we went and the scenery was beautiful. Miriam is awesome! Gave us great ideas of what to do while we were there and answered every question we had. If your looking for a beautiful place to stay with an amazing host I highly recommend Miriam and her studio!! We will definitely be back!! 
5174876,48179888,2015-09-24,23678725,Wade,This was an amazing space in a perfect residential neighborhood.  Just the right amount of space for two and we loved the quiet feel and amazing views. 
5174876,48503362,2015-09-27,10997897,Maartje,"This mother-in-law studio was perfect! It was exactly as described. From the listing I figured it couldn't be that big, but it was one of the bigger studio's I've stayed in yet. Comfortably located in a quiet neighbourhood, this apartment was perfect for us. We walked to downtown a few times (about 45 mins) and took the bus a few blocks away to the Space Needle. 

The place was really clean and well equipped (plenty of towels, even shampoo and bodywash). Water pressure was great in the shower :)

We didn't meet Miriam, although saw her once walking by in the backyard. She was very fast in her online responses and also very friendly and cooperative. All in all we had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend this listing to others."
5174876,48691834,2015-09-28,16751619,Jim,Good location with a warm and cozy space.
5174876,49123542,2015-10-01,1157954,Mary,"I didn't meet Miriam in person, but she was a wonderful host. She was very responsive to communications before and during my stay. I had hoped that there would be a hairdryer in the apartment. There wasn't but Miriam offered to get one and it appeared outside the door later that day. Listing is just as described. Wonderful place to stay."
5174876,49286206,2015-10-02,4809458,John,"Great spot in a convenient - and quiet - location. We didn't require much communication with Miriam, as her instructions were clear and everything in the space was in order just as we needed, but she was prompt and professional in the interactions we did have.

The studio provides for plenty of privacy, and despite being in a basement, we didn't feel like we had to walk on egg shells or anything. Noise from upstairs was very minimal.

We were easily able to park our car in the street. The walk to Capitol Hill/downtown nightlife was pleasant and there were plenty of restaurants and bars in the vicinity.

Overall a great place to kick it in Seattle for a short stay."
5174876,49424614,2015-10-04,34822089,Katrin,It was our first time doing Airbnb and we are very positively surprised. Miriam was a fantastic host. She was always happy to help and the apartment was very clean and cosy! We would definitely recommend a stay at Miriam's!
5174876,50439157,2015-10-12,38385820,Emily,Miriam made us feel so welcome! The apartment was very clean and inviting. We walked to the bus stop everyday and felt very safe. Thank you for a great stay.
5174876,51432844,2015-10-20,17691213,Catherine,The studio was exactly as described and very clean and comfortable. Miriam even left a few little treats for us. The location was perfect. It was in a very quiet and safe neighborhood and walking distance to the bus stop. We would definitely recommend staying here! 
5174876,51697926,2015-10-24,38115128,Jenna,My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this beautiful studio! It was a home away from home. Close enough downtown for a 15 minute uber but tucked into a calm neighborhood.  We appreciated the vase as we bought a beautiful bouquet of flowers at the market. As well as all the cooking supplies! Thank you! We would love to stay here again!
5174876,52054565,2015-10-26,24380798,Chris,"Miriam's private studio is a wonderful place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. It truly is charming. The studio has a private entrance, and beautiful morning views out to the east. The furniture is incredibly comfortable, especially the bed! 

Getting around is easy by car and public transit is right down the street. This spot is near tons of bars and restaurants (and a pot shop if that's your thing).  

I would absolutely recommend this Airbnb to anyone heading to Seattle!"
5174876,52375436,2015-10-28,2316057,Jen,Easy and convenient. Perfect place for a short stay.
5174876,52683620,2015-11-01,40714547,Jocelyn,"Our stay was absolutely delightful! The unit matched the pictures and descriptions perfectly, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Getting to and from places was a snap, and the neighborhood felt charming and friendly."
5174876,53323985,2015-11-08,40778550,Carl,"Our experience visiting Seattle was tremendous and our Airbnb accommodations made a huge positive contribution in this regard.  The studio was super clean, comfortable, attractive, and functional - and convenient to downtown.  It was also very private and looked out on a nice garden area and beautiful view.  My wife and I highly recommend these accommodations - and Miriam was a great hostess as well."
5174876,54255910,2015-11-17,19810947,Broc,"Miriam's place was fantastic! It may be a studio, but it's set up perfectly to make you feel right at home. I never felt cramped. Everything worked great. The bed was super comfy. We especially loved the attention to detail they had there--a few bottles of water, soaps and shampoos in the bathroom, as well as bathrobes and slippers. 

The location is about 2 miles from the downtown area--far enough to have to Uber, but still convenient. It's located in a nice, safe neighborhood, and we weren't bothered by anyone upstairs the entire time we were there! 

Overall, a great place! We'd highly recommend it!"

We never met Miriam however communication was smooth and efficient from the time we made the reservation. We were allowed to occupy the studio earlier than anticipated.
The studio is in a nice neighborhood and we were very comfortable."
5174876,57045998,2015-12-21,8714494,Catherine,Amazing studio in a great location in Seattle! Plenty of street parking even at late hours of the night and very easy to check-in/check-out. Miriam supplies the place with everything you could possibly need to feel at home. Furniture and decor is very modern and sleek. We are definitely recommending this place to anyone we know coming into Seattle! Thanks again Miriam!
5174876,57323209,2015-12-24,50371980,Phillip,"Great experience, very clean and all that I expected for a good stay; thank you."
2110357,9485807,2013-12-30,1816259,N,We were very happy to find this gem. Mr. Tayyab was a very gracious host. He was very prompt with communication and checking in was a breeze. He a beautifully decorated apartment with beautiful views from every window. My daughter and I enjoyed his company and even  found common roots. He was very helpful in recommendations regarding eateries in the area. We enjoyed his hospitality and would definitely go back.
2110357,9574753,2014-01-02,787964,Joanne,"We stayed at Tayyab's home on new year's eve and had a view of the Seattle space needle fireworks that were a couple blocks away. The profile photos are accurate, and provides an amazing view of the water and space needle. 

Tayyab's home was wonderful, I could have spent hours looking at his art and literature collection. His hosting skills were excellent, being attentive to details and interested in making sure your stay in Seattle is an experience. 

Thank you Tayyab for a wonderful stay, I would return and recommend this place to others. "
2110357,9860500,2014-01-14,2265689,Ryan,"I was heading to Seattle for a hastily-arranged trip-- Tayyab not only accommodated me on short notice, but was also flexible enough to check me in early when my flight arrived ahead of schedule. Tayyab is a wonderful host-- very friendly, personable, and helpful!

The place is absolutely gorgeous. The bedroom has breathtaking views of the Space Needle, Queen Anne, & Lake Union. And the kitchen/breakfast nook has stunning views of Puget Sound. The bedroom has a writing desk with a comfortable office chair-- perfect if you need to get some work done during your stay. The internet was free and fast. The private bathroom was well-stocked with incidentals.

Best of all, Tayyab's place is close to everything-- an easy 10-15 minute walk to Westlake or Pike Place. If you’re heading to Capitol Hill, the 8 bus is steps away. And the doormen for Tayyab’s building were great too-- one very friendly doorman called me a cab during a particularly nasty storm and kept me company while I waited.

I can’t overstate how wonderful Tayyab’s place is. If you are planning on a stay for Seattle, the convenient location, the gorgeous views, and the friendly host are unbeatable."
2110357,9908825,2014-01-18,2819372,Luc,"I had the most wonderful 2-night stay at Tayyab's beautiful, comfortable and immaculate apartment. Tayyab is a gentleman and a learned man.  His hospitality was warm and thoughtful and his conversation over glasses of wine or cups of coffee was engaging and stimulating. I hope to have a chance to stay at Tayyab's place again on any future visit to Seattle and I highly recommend his room to the airbnb community. "
2110357,9946575,2014-01-20,11364508,Priti,"Tayyab is an incredibly gracious host and I am so delighted to have met him. His home is beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and has a breath-taking view of the Space Needle and the bay. He was ever so kind in being flexible with my travel plans, and was eager to show me around the bldg amenities including the pool, hot tub and sauna. I stayed for only for one night after traveling and he instantly made me feel comfortable and at home. I am so grateful for his hospitality and look forward to keeping in touch. Thank you so much , Tayyab! "
2110357,10016749,2014-01-25,1184057,George,"Staying with Tayyab was the highlight of my trip in Seattle. Not only because of the utterly brilliant apartment but also because of Tayyab as a person. So great to come across unique people like this.

 "
2110357,10200868,2014-02-05,11827234,Chad,"Staying with Tayyab was great, and his place is fabulous.  The room/bath were clean, comfy bed, and amazing views of the space needle and downtown Seattle. Tayyab is a great host.  This is a great location if you are visiting the Seattle Center - just a 5 minute walk.  "
2110357,10231979,2014-02-08,7485496,Patty,"Staying with Tayyab in Seattle was an absolute delight. Not only does he offer a stunning apartment with breathtaking views of the Space Needle and downtown Seattle, but he is also a gracious host who makes the most delicious latte in the city. Would definitely stay with Tayyab again. "
2110357,10288157,2014-02-10,11029829,Kate,"Mr. Tayyab is a fantastic host! Exuberant in conversation, kind and fun to share space with. His home and lifestyle is most definitely a work of art.  I felt very comfortable and was treated as a top-notch guest. Not to mention:  The view is exceptional! THANK YOU Airbnb in Seattle. Sincerely, Miss Kate"
2110357,10542740,2014-02-24,2983718,Ryan,"Tayyab was a great host and extremely helpful when I had questions about the city.

The views were stunning, I got to wakeup to a phenomenal view of the city every morning. It was an easy walk to just about anything Seattle had to offer and easy access to public transportation to boot. The space was very well kept, plenty of international artwork in the apartment, wifi was fast, and the bed was très comfy-- I even had my own private bathroom. Tayyab is super respectful and will give you all the privacy you need, but in the same stride can hold up fantastic conversations.

All in all, I got to experience Seattle, and make a friend. Thanks Tayyab!"
2110357,10628255,2014-02-28,12397101,Edward,"Professor Mahmud was amazing. Not only did he let me stay in his beautiful apartment for a very humble price but he made me coffee in the morning and had the New York Times waiting for me to read when I awoke. I can't imagine a better host. He was sincere, kind, and attentive. This has to have been the single best overnight experience I've had outside of Momma's. I would recommend Tayyab to anyone. He really did open up his home and heart to the utmost he could and I greatly appreciate it. "
2110357,10718650,2014-03-04,11478683,Thomas,Tayyab's accommodations delivered exactly what he promises. The location is excellent for a visit to many of Seattle's charming neighborhoods. The building is in a safe secure neighborhood and the apartment itself is very comfortable. The views are fantastic A+. As a host Tayyab is gracious and helpful. He shared some great tips for a restaurants and museums and even shared a very helpful iPhone app (OneBusAway) Communication was very easy and overall we were very very pleased with our AirBnB experience! 
2110357,10843230,2014-03-10,1113623,Sally,"We have stayed in many airbnb places and this is one of our very favorites! Tayyab was a wonderful, gracious host. He was very accommodating, friendly, informative and a joy to chat with. The apartment is amazing. Perfect space, a private room and bath with an incredible view of the city. Having the Space Needle as a ""night light"" was fantastic. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and we enjoyed the art throughout the space. We hope to be back--for a longer stay!"
2110357,11304328,2014-03-29,12699539,Liz,The view from the apartment is breathtaking and the location is absolutely fantastic. Tayyab was a wonderful host and makes a fantastic latte!! Would definitely recommend staying here!
2110357,11547466,2014-04-07,4137894,Oliver,"I stayed with Tayyab for two nights and highly recommend the apartment.  Ideally suited, with major attractions, restaurants and bars a stone's throw away, the apartment is impeccably presented.  Tayyab was a delightful host who made me feel at home.  I would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle and will definitely return to Tayyab's apartment the next time I'm in Seattle.  "
2110357,11742723,2014-04-14,12237849,Kirsten,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Tayyab for three nights while we were in town for a wedding. Not only were the views from our bedroom and the rest of the apartment unbeatable, Tayyab was very inviting and helpful. He gave us great suggestions for what to see while in town as well as how to use public transportation to get to various places. This was our first experience using Airbnb and I'm excited to use it again. If we ever make it back to Seattle, I know where our first pick of stay is."
2110357,12167790,2014-04-24,14411126,Adam,"Tayyab is the best host you could ask for.  The neighborhood is famously lovely, and Professor Mahmud's apartment is full of collected items from all over, and he's more than happy to leave you be, listen to your stories, or tell you his.  This was my first time using AirBnB and it could not have gone better.  Thanks Tayyab!"
2110357,12292955,2014-04-28,5776843,Rosetta,"Tayyab's apt was in a great and convenient location of Seattle. The views were unbeatable especially the Space Needle as a night light. Tayyab was a fabulous host and maked his famous latte in the morning for me. Due to unexpected guests, Tayyab was able to make alternate accommodations for me that was just as nice as his apt. If I went back to Seattle, I would definitely stay at his place again."
2110357,12443672,2014-05-02,7011706,Anne,Apartment is in a very convenient location and has a beautiful view of Seattle. From your bedroom you can wake up to a spectacular view of the sunrise behind the Space Needle. Tayyab was a very hospitable and personable host. My stay at the apartment was very comfortable and relaxing.
2110357,12495718,2014-05-04,8885839,Silvia,"Great friendly host, AMAZING apartment (the best views of Seattle for sure). If you're not on a very limited budget, staying here is definitely worth the price!"
2110357,12527012,2014-05-05,11560365,Gloria,"The place was just as described. Beautiful view, convenient location, and clean rooms. Tayyab was very accommodating of our situation and helped to create a nice stay while in Seattle. "
2110357,12677132,2014-05-07,14902048,Jessica,"Tayyab was awesome! We loved our stay in Seattle, I wish we could have stayed longer. The view of the Space Needle from the bedroom is probably better than any hotel in Seattle. He was a great host and would definitely stay here again next time we visit. Thanks for everything, Tayyab! "
2110357,12806991,2014-05-11,1918950,Ad,"Tayyab is a great host. Place was cheap, spacious and pleasant. He provided wifi, new sheets, towels, and bathroom amenities. Would definitely stay there again."
2110357,12879727,2014-05-13,6637831,Drew,"Elegant views does not even begin to describe how lovely Mr. Mahmud's apartment is. there are three giant bay windows, and when combined, display almost 180 degrees of the Seattle skyline. The apartment was easy to get to, my wife and I had no car the entire trip and we didn't need one. We arrived in SEATAC, rode the light rail to downtown Seattle, and walked less than a mile to the building, all for less than 7.50 for the both of us. We were able to follow our host's instructions easily, and had a private room and bathroom that was clean and well stocked with toiletries and linens. The atmosphere in the apartment is definitely mature, I would not have felt comfortable with bringing children here. (There are expensive and fragile things in this apartment).There is no TV, which is GREAT, because you should be out walking this beautiful city! The first night, I called the space needle restaurant, Sky City, booked a last minute table, and walked the two blocks and had the best Halibut I've ever tasted. The views were incredible, especially since the entire stay it was 75 degrees and sunny. Yeah. Be jealous. We were able to walk to any part of downtown Seattle within 15 minutes, and we could've taken public transit, but it was too pretty to pass up walking around the city. I recommend waking up early and running or biking through the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is right down the way from the apartment. Mr. Mahmud is kind enough to offer full use of his kitchen and cooking utensils, as well as laundry facilities. This isn't a hotel though, it's a person's life! If you can't handle the quirks and unique experience of living in someone else's home for a few days, you'd be better off in a boring hotel. I only wish I had been able to spend more time with our host, as he seemed like quite an interesting and unique person. The bed is low to the ground for those who would struggle to get up and out, but it is amazingly comfy! The view is great, the location is perfect, and the hospitality was warm. "
2110357,12954169,2014-05-15,7445744,Josh,"Tayyab was a great host. His place has an amazing view of the space needle. Though I was out most of the day and only stayed one night, his place was very accommodating and close to Belltown, where a list of restaurants and nightlife are only blocks away. There's a very close bus stop across his complex, that will get you to most places around there. Kerry Park is about a mile away but there are inclined streets to get to see the view of the city, it was a fun rewarding climb. Had a great night sleep and was treated to an awesome sunrise with the space needle in the background. "
2110357,12974592,2014-05-16,13610083,Mark,"Not sure which was better.  The room (outstanding view, private with an extremely comfortable bed) or our gracious host.  Thank you so much for your hospitality.  We live just an hour north of Seattle but will definitely come back to stay!  What a lovely way to experience a whole new side of Seattle for us!  "
2110357,13178989,2014-05-21,11359623,Cheryl,"Tayyab's place was perfect for my 3 nights in Seattle. I was in town for a conference at the Washington State Convention Center but didn't want to pay the conference hotel prices. The accommodations were exactly as pictured and Tayyab was as friendly and helpful as other reviewers have noted. The views from his place are spectacular! Public transportation is steps away and the walk to downtown is easy, with plenty of places to stop for a bite, a drink, or a bit of shopping. If you're in Seattle, Tayyab's is the place to stay!"
2110357,13464902,2014-05-28,11279423,Van,"Our experience at Tayyab's listing was wonderful!!!  The location & the views were spectacular.  The listing was exactly as described, but the views were even better.  Tayyab was very helpful and hospitable.  The building was very secure & the door-people were extremely friendly & helpful.  The neighborhood was safe and pleasant to walk around.  The room has its own private bathroom, and the view was amazing with the space needle in prominent view.  We would definitely stay here again!"
2110357,13538476,2014-05-30,2059378,Vickie,"Great host and location.  Some of the best views in Seattle, 4-5 blocks away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, Key Arena, etc.).  Walking distance to Pike Place Market, downtown, etc.  Professor Mahmud was extremely nice, and a very solicitous host, answering all our questions about local eateries, etc.  Secure building and a very clean and comfortable room in a beautiful apartment."
2110357,13691722,2014-06-02,2830624,Bill,Yayyab was a terrific host. The rental was just as advertised.  The condo is in an awesome location in downtown Seattle.  The views are amazing!  We would be delighted to stay here again.  Bill K
2110357,14089796,2014-06-11,3296395,Heike,"On our Pacific Coast Trip from San Francisco to Seattle Tayyab was our last stop for two nights before return to Germany! His apartment was the greatest place to finish the holiday. Tayyab was very friendly, relaxed and helpful. The view from the 20th floor was awesome. The Latte Macchiato was really the best in town! :-) Really!!! I hope we will come back to Seattle and stay with Tayyab again!"
2110357,14147152,2014-06-13,13299691,Rafiq,"My stay with Tayyab exceeded my expectations in every possible way. The most warm & comfortable bed, great views & really enjoyed his coffee too. Next year when I book my annual trip to Seattle I'll be checking if his amazing accommodation is available before booking anything else. See you next year, for a little longer than 2 days :)"
2110357,14187385,2014-06-14,1340387,Chintan,"Absolutely the best views in Seattle on 20th floor, overlooking space needle."
2110357,14267464,2014-06-16,5475720,Robert,"This has to be the best location and view AirBnB is offering in Seattle!
Tayyab is a very casual, and accommodating host with a sensational 20th floor condo staring directly at the landmark World's Fair Space Needle! 
Furnishings are a collection of exotic travel mixed with modern functionality. "
2110357,14387024,2014-06-18,12626631,Thom,We thoroughly enjoyed our brief two night stay in the home of Tayyab Mahmud.  He provided us with a beautiful place of rest for our stay in Seattle.  We enjoyed his beautifully furnished condo and our small room with a portrait view of the famous Seattle Space Needle was perfect in all respects.  We enjoyed the little red light at the top of the needle which blinked at us throughout the night.
2110357,14470565,2014-06-20,14413179,Felicitas,Fantastic views and great location. We really enjoyed staying with Tayyab. He is a friendly and relaxed host. The bed is comfy and we couldn't get enough watching the Space Needle. The room is in a secure building in a safe neighborhood within walking distance of the Space Needle and downtown. We would be delighted to stay here again during our next visit to Seattle and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a spetacular view. 
2110357,14502147,2014-06-21,11421646,Dyonisio,"Our stay in Seattle at the home of Tayyab was wonderful! 
His apartment is decorated with exquisite taste and is located in the best part of Seattle, just a few meters from the Space Needle. 

Tayyab is an excelent host - THE BEST! 
Certainly we won a new and very dear friend. 

When we get back to Seattle (and we will return!) we will stay in Tayyab´s apartment for sure."
2110357,14926390,2014-06-29,4354323,Maxim,"A perfect place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is very clean, beautifully decorated and what is most shocking - the fantastic view from the window! It's like living in Space Needle, best in city. And it only takes 20 minutes to get to Downtown by feet.
The host, mister Mahmud, is a very nice person and we had really interesting conversations during breakfasts :-)"
2110357,15109719,2014-07-02,16586978,Jack,"Tayyab was simply the best--convivial, responsive and informative. And the views from his condo were amazing.  This locale is ideally situated for access to Seattle's downtown and major attractions."
2110357,15208362,2014-07-05,3802004,Rick,"This was my first experience with Airbnb... And did I ever luck out.  First, Tayyab was the most incredible host.  From start to finish, he made my stay perfect.  He is a gracious host and made me feel very comfortable (even though I had a bit if anxiety about staying in a strangers home).  He has gone to great lengths to make the guest room perfect for his visitors.  From the wifi to the comfortable bed, from the private in room ensuite to the views from the bedroom.  I cannot recommend him enough.  It's location is perfect (lots of restaurants, coffee shops, attractions, and the sound... Puget Sound is easily walkable at the bottom of the hill.  I would stay here again and again.  Thank you Tayyab!!!!"

2110357,15634680,2014-07-13,16354780,Karen,"My husband and I had a most enjoyable stay with Tayyab.  He made us feel very welcome in his lovely home, and prior to that, had given us great instructions for getting to his place from the airport.  Tayyab's approach to his visitors is positive and warm and yet privacy by/from both parties is ascertained from the beginning.

The view from our bedroom (with it's own bathroom) was spectacular and we never tired of it, night or day.  The apartment is so central to all highlights that the city offers.

This was our first experience of airbnb and we would recommend it to anyone.  The experience was beyond our expectations."
2110357,15670099,2014-07-14,13192024,Guenter,"Tayyab hat uns das Quartier bereits um 13.00 Uhr zur Verfügung gestellt - ein großzügiges Entgegenkommen. Er hat uns persönlch abgeholt und zu seiner Wohnung gebracht. Wir hatten eine schönes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad und Blick auf die Needle. Die Fotos auf der Inseratseite entsprechen wirklich der Realität. Die Wohnung bietet phantastische Ausblicke auf Seattle und den Pazifik. Wir haben uns dort ausgesprochen wohl gefühlt. Tayyab ist ein perfekter Gastgeber. Danke für die tolle Unterbringung, die guten Gespräche und die beste Latte von Seattle!"
2110357,15774020,2014-07-15,4964093,Brett,"What a great trip to Seattle, hosted by Tayyab. Apartment was spectacular and accurately advertised. Could not imagine a better place to stay while in Seattle. Amazing view of the Space Needle and Olympic. Tayyab was a great host and the stay was simple/elegant. Building was spectacular and the perfect starting spot for adventures around Seattle. Wish we could have stayed longer. Happy to be a reference for the apartment whenever needed."
2110357,15916229,2014-07-18,16062577,Emily,"Mr. Mahmud was a gracious and kind host. He made us feel comfortable in his home. The views from the balcony and the bedroom were unparalleled...nothing else for that price in downtown Seattle could compete. Walking distance to EVERYTHING. Never took a cab once, and did everything we wanted to do. Great stay."
2110357,16077097,2014-07-22,13962140,Patrick,"I greatly enjoyed my stay in Seattle with Tayyab!

2110357,16240781,2014-07-24,11763534,Yvonne,We spent two wonderful nights in Tayyab's apartment situated in the 20th floor of a building in Belltown. The apartment and our room with Bath-ensuite were comfortable and clean. Lying in our bed we had a spectacular view on the Space Needle. Tayyab is a really nice and helpful person. He gave excellent recommendations for sightseeing. We will definately come back! Thanks Tayyab!! 
2110357,16356159,2014-07-26,14967991,Susanne,"The spotless, ideally located apartment is worth staying especially for the fantastic view. Tayyab is a nice and generous host and made out stay in Seattle even better."

2110357,16842944,2014-08-03,6545291,Keith,"Tayyab did not make us feel welcome when we arrived - there was a communications mix up which I accept some responsibility for*, but I do not think this merited his unfriendly attitude. Things did improve somewhat later on. Also the bathroom was not very clean. The apartment has stunning views and is in a great location. However his initial greeting sadly affected how we felt about our stay.
Keith

* Tayyab asked me to text him on arrival. However I did not have his number and mistakenly used the airbnb app to message him instead. This led to him not meeting us on arrival and my having to go through the doorman instead - which he was very unhappy about. He was also extremely insistent that he had sent an email with detailed instructions - I did not receive this (he did not believe me about this) - i do not know why it didn't arrive."
2110357,17102991,2014-08-07,17031199,Elisabeth,"Nous avons été très bien reçu, notre hôte très serviable, je le recommande vivement. La localisation de l'appartement est parfaite, près du centre ville et des quartiers animés. Vue splendide du 20° étage sur Space Needle."
2110357,17157154,2014-08-08,153050,Larry,"Tayyab went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and he is a most gracious host. He rode with me to show me where to park in the underground garage and made sure I knew how to get back out in the morning. His place is as advertised, with wonderful views from the 20th floor of the Space Needle in one direction and the Sound in the other.

I hope to return to Seattle one day and stay with Tayyab again but for a longer stay"

Stockwerk. durch den kleinen Erker im Zimmer hatte man einen fabelhaften Rundumblick. Das Bett war sehr bequem.

My wife & I had my own private bath with room, a delightful library of books & brochures (though I lacked the time to indulge them) and a splendid view of downtown Seattle complete with Science Center and Space Needle. See here: (website hidden)

Mr. Mahmud was pleasant, patient (as I had a few changes in plans) without being over indulging. He is a quietly gracious man. He also provided private secure parking for my rental car which I appreciated.

The location was really nice only being a short walk from the Ferry Terminal on the water front.

I will certain look to stay here when I come to Seattle again, if he will have me. :-)"

We were delayed horribly in our arrival and changed our plans to add an extra day but Tayyab was very accommodating. Laundry was available for an extra $5. We were able to be independent and Tayyab left us alone for the most part but did give us some advice on where to go. We went out in the evening and returned home late to find the bedroom door had locked itself (we only had a key to the front door) and we had to wake Tayyab up to unlock it which was quite embarrassing but he was ok with this too. Overall, though, a pleasant visit. I would recommend."
2110357,20702334,2014-10-04,142645,Christine,"What a wonderful airbnb experience!  Tayyab was a great host, had very clear communication and the airbnb was exactly what I expected.  The views from this spot are amazing and the location also very good.  I would definitely come back.  Thanks for everything Tayyab!"
2110357,20907672,2014-10-07,14605578,Carol,"Tayyub was waiting for us as he said he would and made our arrival seamless and timely. Explained everything and discussed our agendas so that we would all be aware of our individual plans so that arrangements could be made as far as our departure was concerned. Now to the views: Absolutely STUNNING!!!!!.  His was the Pugent Sound, ours the Space Needle from our room. We didn't want to close our eyes at night we felt so fortunate to have this opportunity. And during both day and night, the views from the patio we exquisite. We are so glad he has chosen to share this wonderful space. Also, the room was very clean, with private bath and lock on door which was a perfect fit for us.  Most everything was within walking distance, although it is a little hilly so after walking several hours we opted for a cab back at a reasonable price. We have already told our friends who want to go there in the spring to definitely try this arrangement out. Thanks again for superb hospitality."
2110357,21380633,2014-10-16,850709,Lorraine And David,Tayyab was polite and helpful in every way. He even invited me to share some wine along with him and a personal friend and we enjoyed a lively conversation together. His lodging is beautifully located for all of the tourist tractions in Seattle within easy walking distance. I had a lovely stay and highly recommend him to anyone. 
2110357,21458862,2014-10-18,17687068,Carmen,"We spent some wonderful days at Tayyabs AirBnB accomodation. Tayyab was a great host. He provided us with all the information we needed for our stay, was very helpful and recommended us a very nice place for breakfast. The room and the private bathroom were awesome. We enjoyed the incredible view at Seattle center, especially the enlightened Space Needle in the evening. On our next trip to Seattle we would definitely  stay at Tayyabs apartment again!"
2110357,21620387,2014-10-20,4273262,Lalin,"Tayyab's apartment is located centrally in Seattle, with breathtaking views of the city! Lying in your bed, you can watch the Space Needle light up at night and view the gentle clouds breeze over it in the morning. Plus, if you wake up early enough, you can see the sky burn as the sun rises with the mountain range in the distance. From the living room, you can see the ships pass by and guard the rooftops. The place is dreamy, and Tayyab as a host is as elegant as his home that has very personal touches. Art pieces, books, guides for the area, fresh flowers, strong coffee... Whatever you need! Plus the amenities (wifi, bathroom and etc.) run smoothly. 

In the midst of my crazy schedule, Tayyab was incredibly accommodating and flexible with my needs! He showed me around quickly and then was very kind about giving me space. I would absolutely be his guest again and recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle!"

Tayyab's apartment looks exactly like the photos on the profile, and there's a lot more: the very convenient location, the elegant building, the stunning view from the bedroom, the facilities and decoration of the apartment, the super comfy bed, the warm welcome by the host, Dr.Tayyab. I love everything! Will definitely stay again."
2110357,22158091,2014-10-31,2779882,Marcus,Tayyab is a gracious and welcoming host.  Everything was as described and the views from his apartment are tremendous - especially the city lights and the Space Needle at night.  My stay was brief - I arrived at 10pm and left at 8am the next morning - but it was just what I needed.
2110357,22374511,2014-11-04,22525729,Natasha,"AMAZING first airbnb experience. Dr. Mahmud was the perfect host-- friendly, welcoming, and accessible, but gave us our own space. The location was perfect... About a 10 minute walk to anywhere you could possibly want to visit in Seattle and better views than any hotel in a comparable price range! Thank you so much! "
2110357,22428206,2014-11-06,11308625,Christine,Tayyab went out of his way to make sure every detail was taken care of.  His home is lovely and well-situated for anyone visiting Seattle.  We especially appreciated having a secure place to park.

100% totally worth it."

He was also a very welcoming host and made us feel at home for our short stay. This place is great for a single or couple, highly recommend if you go to Seattle. "

Tayyab's apartment is beautiful, just as in the photos.  It is filled with interesting objects and books.  It also has a stunning view of the waterfront and the Space Needle.  Tayyab was easy to communicate with and has everything well-organized for hosting."
2110357,24568646,2014-12-30,22504890,Janice,"The room was very clean, comfy - exactly as shown and the view was stunning! The location is perfect too - within walkable distance to a lot of tourist attractions such as the waterfront and even the market. There are likewise several bus stops nearby to different places.  
Prof Mahmud was very organized and he gave clear instructions beforehand regarding directions etc and he was very responsive. He also drove me to the train station at 5am so I could catch an early flight which is highly appreciated. He respected the privacy of his and mine a lot. A great stay overall. 
  "
2110357,24761577,2015-01-02,13610083,Mark,Tayyab is such an amazing host that you can almost forget the setting of his condo.  We are from the Seattle region and have now come down twice to be able to experience what Seattle is all about.  If you have the opportunity to come visit Seattle do not miss the chance to stay here.  It is not only amazing for the location but is only enhanced by your host.  
2110357,25509531,2015-01-18,14203708,Alvin,"There was a reason why I picked this place as all previous comments were spot on - everything from the room, location, and the host.  "
2110357,25543297,2015-01-19,24033338,George,The was our first experience with air BnB so did not know what to expect.  It went very smoothly.  Dr. Mahmud was a very good host.  He provided plenty of information about arrival and was easy to meet up with to get keys.  The place was as promised with wonderful view of Space Needle and close to downtown attractions like the pike place market. 
2110357,26690046,2015-02-17,2309163,Max,"Everything was better than advertised! Dr. Mahmud an excellent host, the room has an exceptional view of the Space Needle, and the apartment is walkable to everything downtown and along the waterfront.

2110357,27136187,2015-02-26,398672,Jenny,"Honestly one of the best places I've ever stayed in Seattle. Tayyab was a dream host, and his apartment is breath-taking. Both warm and interesting, but also central and convenient. Plus, the room had a fascinating library (floor-to-ceiling). Between that and the spectacular views, I almost didn't get any sleep. But when I did sleep, it was deep & sound (great bed). Best way to rise and shine for a day in Seattle!"
2110357,28218961,2015-03-20,2779882,Marcus,"My 2nd stay with Tayyab.  He's a gracious and welcoming host, and this is a great place to stay for me in Belltown.  Comfortable bed and private bathroom, great views of the Space Needle  and surrounding area."

2110357,28589675,2015-03-26,1146659,Jill,Fantastic views. Wifi. Quiet. Easy access into the condo and building. Thermostat in the room for customized heat! Great for those wet rainy days. Close to the Seattle Center. We ended up walking everywhere- didn't need the bus. Great coffee shops nearby- Cherry Street and Drip Coffee. Fantastic Vietnamese restaurant in the same block- Green Leaf. Handy bottle shops with local brews. Didn't see our host but once due to our different schedules. But he was so kind to lend me a warm rain coat so I wouldn't have to buy one. Love airbnb and the trust we have with each other!
2110357,28800685,2015-03-30,6823089,Michiel,"Tayyab was a wonderful host, and his apartment is beautiful and very comfortable. Perks not yet mentioned in the profile are a great book collection and a public bike rental station just a minute away from the building. I would definitely choose to stay with Tayyab again if I visit Seattle again."
2110357,29006431,2015-04-02,23413715,Greg  And Rae,"We really enjoyed our stay with Dr. Mahmud. He gave very detailed instructions prior to arrival making it easy to get to his place. He was so welcoming, showing us around the house, making us feel right at home. He also gave excellent advice as to what to see in Seattle. He was always willing to sit and chat, we enjoyed getting to know him. His home was very comfortable and provided an amazing view of the city from the balcony and the bedroom. The apartment was also centrally located so we were able to walk to all of our locations. 
We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend it! We have nothing negative to say about our stay. 
"
2110357,29413895,2015-04-07,28554779,John,"Yes, the host made me feel very welcome, and I was completely satisfied with the bedroom, and the apartment, and the location.  It was a wonderful place to stay, and I would happily stay with Prof. Mahmud again."
2110357,29495371,2015-04-08,4534813,Emily," Our son Luke had a wonderful stay here- his very first Airbnb experience. Tayyab made him really welcome. He thought the accommodation was great and that Tayyab's book collection was incredible!
This is what he wrote to us about the stay:
Tayyab was very friendly. I wish I could have spent more time there and got to know him better as he's really interesting and knowledgeable - about Seattle as well as just generally. He was also great with helping me book a taxi, with recommendations for food, activities and public transport; and had a range of different teas for me to try! All around a wonderful stay, an incredible apartment in a great part of town (central, walking distance everywhere but not right in the touristy part of town so slightly more private)."
2110357,29809729,2015-04-13,19288849,Michael,Dr. Tayyab Mahmed couldn't have been a more gracious host. The accommodations were superb and the views spectacular! The neighborhood had fantastic attractions within walking distance and diverse restaurants that appeal to any palate. We would/will stay with Dr. Mahmed again in the future in a heartbeat.
2110357,29956716,2015-04-14,6040853,Ming,The host is very friendly and hospitable. His unit is very well furnished and it is equipped with everything you need. The view is irreplaceable. Friendly concierge takes security very seriously. Highly recommended.
2110357,30467522,2015-04-22,21943855,Katie,"My stay was great!  I was in town on business,  and Tayyab's home was perfect.  He was very nice,  accommodating,  and gracious. I enjoyed talking with him.  The building is secure,  and the doorman was extremely helpful. The bed was comfortable,  everything was very clean. All as advertised,  and even more comfortable than I'd hoped. The location is great, walking distance to downtown,  and right on transit and Pronto bikeshare."
2110357,30782018,2015-04-27,3394017,John,"Excellent experience. The room and entire apartment is outstanding, surpassed only by the views.  During my stay, Tayyab though out of town, reached out by phone to make sure all was well, asking if anything was needed.  All in all, a great experience! "
2110357,30958964,2015-04-29,31658659,Stephanie,"Apartment more beautiful than I expected, with expansive views off of two sides that included ocean, city and Space Needle. The bedroom has an amazing book collection, desk with the amazing view, a Tempurpedic mattress and the room has its own private bath. The host  is clean, organized, polite and accommodating. He provided lovely suggestions for restaurants in the area. I recommend this to anyone. "
2110357,31146191,2015-05-02,13631945,Ted,Another great visit to Seattle.  Was a pleasure to stay with Tayyab again.  My home away from hme is Seattle.

2110357,32368788,2015-05-17,26116821,David,"I cannot speak highly enough as to how awesome this Airbnb experience was. Dr. Mahmud was an amazing host who made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. Moreover, pictures (while amazing) cannot capture how breathtaking this view is. The Space Needle is literally your bedroom nightlight if you don't close the blinds. Everything about this Airbnb was amazing. Would love to stay again next time in Seattle. "
2110357,32468028,2015-05-18,11477046,William,Dr Mahmud was a gracious host and the condo experience exceeded expectations.  The location is perfect and the scenic views outstanding - the Space Needle right there out the bedroom window and the Puget Sound from the living room/balcony.  We had our bicycles with us and enjoyed the local cycling trails.  You won't be disappointed!
2110357,32617954,2015-05-19,32871865,Brett,Tayyab's room is great. The view is just amazing. Almost everything I wanted to see in Seattle was within walking distance. The optional parking was very secure and definitely worth it.
2110357,33453702,2015-05-28,3597827,Li,"Dr. Mamud is very gentle and considerate, providing very detailed information and instruction before and after my arrival. Great place to stay-- comfortable and clean, with a nice view. The location is also perfect, with a 5-minute walking distance to the space needle, and several places of interest not so far away, such as Pike's Place Market, the waterfront, Olympic sculpture park, etc. Also a couple of very nice restaurant around! "
2110357,34200025,2015-06-06,26521789,Eva,Tayyab is a perfect host. The condo is located very centrally. The view is definitely amazing and the bedroom big  and comfortable. I was welcomed very friendly and would always come back to this place.
2110357,34276353,2015-06-07,27972705,Will,This listing was just as advertised. Tayyab was a very gracious and kind host who made us feel at home. His building was easy to get to - only a 20 minute walk (with our big luggage) from the light rail with easy access to Pike Place and the waterfront. The views from his apartment are amazing. I easily would have spent triple his rate for an equivalent view at a hotel. I highly recommend his space. 
2110357,34413746,2015-06-08,15604311,Lauren,"Staying with Dr.Mahmud was a wonderful experience! Communication was clear and it was easy to get a hold of him for anything we may need.

He was very gracious and made us feel at home. We would definitely recommend him!"
2110357,34632830,2015-06-10,21256851,Michael,"Our experience staying in Seattle with Dr. Mahmud was terrific. It started with excellent communication before we even made reservations and continued after making reservations and as our visit approached. He made sure that all questions were answered and that we already felt comfortable before arriving.

After arriving we were treated exactly as we desired. We had a friendly host who offered us coffee and travel advice, but also gave us privacy and peaceful place to rest. We made a friend who we will want to visit again when we return to Seattle.

What can I say about the apartment; it is all about the views. I was constantly drawn to the balcony for its panoramic vista, but the view  was great from every room. The location, close to the Space Needle made it easy to tour the city on the trolley or the duck tour."
2110357,34739305,2015-06-11,2779882,Marcus,This was my 3rd stay with Tayyab!  Enough said!
2110357,34929600,2015-06-14,4479918,Alejandro,"Tayyab was very accommodating and super friendly. The Airbnb listing doesn't do justice to the amazing view you can get from his apartment. My experience has raised the bar for other hosts at Airbnb, which definitely translates to kudos for Tayyab.
Everything was in order and I recommend others to stay with him as well!"
2110357,35303431,2015-06-17,31901296,Richard,"Professor Mahmud was a friendly and informative host. His place has the best view and location in the city and the room, towels, and sheets were all very clean. I was very satisfied with my stay and I recommend him to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle."
2110357,35780606,2015-06-22,30068123,Megan,Tayyab was a wonderful host and his home was exactly as described. The views were beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the small library of books in our room and could have spent a week in there just browsing and reading. I just wish we would have had more time to spend getting to know Tayyab. Perhaps next time! I highly recommend staying with Tayyab and can't wait to return!
2110357,35951993,2015-06-23,9932960,Natali,"Mr Mahmud was very commucative from the moment I scheduled staying at this place. He was a great host. His place was colorful, and nicely decorated. The views were amazing. No need to go up to the Space Needle, you actually see it before going to bed, and first thing in the morning right in front of you through the windows. Location was great. Host was very friendly. The room was very comfortable.  Overall a great experience. Thank you Mr. Mahmud!"

Just perfect for the long weekend getaway; my wife and I were equally impressed.  The location couldn't have been better.  I highly recommend staying here! 
2110357,37699954,2015-07-09,37095447,Juleen,"Prof Mahmud was very friendly and extremely helpful in answering questions and helping us get around the city.   Our luggage was delayed and he was once again very helpful and patient in helping us with its arrival.  We were there just quickly over night to catch the Clipper the next morning and the location couldn't have been better.  The views were outstanding.  We didn't need to visit the space needle, the view from the apartment was just as good if not better because it included the space needle.  "
2110357,37834783,2015-07-11,1604092,Simona,"Don't think twice about staying here--do it! Dr. Mahmud is a gracious host and his home is equally as warm and inviting. We had a wonderful two-night stay here and the best part was waking up to the Space Needle. The location is excellent, the bed heavenly, and the apartment's amenities more than sufficient. We would love to stay here again on our next visit. Thank you Tayyab!"
2110357,38020650,2015-07-12,2128954,Nancy,"Staying with Tayyab was delightful, from start to finish he was friendly, with timely correspondence and clear directions. He patiently waited for our late arrival after an  infamous Seattle traffic delay. "

All of the previous reviews were very accurate. Tayyab is a very generous and accommodating host who made us feel right at home. We could not have asked for more. 
2110357,39358126,2015-07-22,16932220,Thomas,Host went far out of his way to accommodate our needs. A room and view well worth a six star hotel. And surrounded by wonderful books (and with great desk and chair) in a luxury apartment. Ideal location for viewing and going to Space Needle and most other attractions.
2110357,39682917,2015-07-25,12815044,Flo,"Tayyab greeted us personally at the front door. 
He gave us our own set of keys. 
He was available and eager to offer guidance whenever asked-yet, allowed us privacy when we wanted to be alone. "
2110357,41318542,2015-08-07,29763852,Step,"The place is amazing. Spectacular views and super convenient location to everything down town (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pike Place Market etc). Tayyab was super friendly and very hospitable. If I am in Seattle again I will most definitely be looking to stay here again. "
2110357,41737866,2015-08-09,31621075,Zhen,"Tayyab is an extremely welcoming host. Very clean, breath taking view. Beautiful apartment 100% will come back again."
2110357,41995573,2015-08-10,37490257,John,"We only stayed in Seattle for one day, and we were very fortunate to have found Dr. Mahmud's residence for our brief visit.  He was/is the ultimate host.  The location was perfect for us.  We were able to utilize public transit to get to his home and were able to catch the #24 bus just around the corner when we left for our cruise to Alaska.  We were within walking distance of all the major sights in Seattle; including the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glasshouse, Pike Place Market and the Olympic Sculpture Park. (The view from the balcony is spectacular.) We appreciated the safe neighborhood as well as our host's doorman!  Dr. Mahmud provided all the pre-trip information necessary for us enjoy our first experience with AIRBNB.  We only regret that we didn't have more time to visit with Dr. Mahmud.  We had a brief discussion about his research in economics, and we could have used hours to reflect upon his theories.   "
2110357,42126766,2015-08-11,12734493,Nancy,"The best Seattle view!  Sunset overlooking the Space Needle was breathtaking.  Professor Mahmud was very welcoming, greeting us in front of the building, guiding us to the private parking lot, and walking us through the key process to enter the residence.  He was extremely accommodating."
2110357,42248510,2015-08-12,27756987,Sandy,"SUPERB LOCATION!!! Beautiful view, clean, comfortable, nice balcony with beautiful sunset, 2 blocks from space needle and very close to Pike's Market.  Tayyab friendly host!"
2110357,42517714,2015-08-14,13709313,Ying,The view from condo is incredible. It is a corner unit. So there are picture windows on two sides. You can see both sunrise and sunset from this place which is rare. The host is also very helpful in pre-trip information exchange. The unit is very tastefully decorated. I would highly recommend it.
2110357,42701692,2015-08-15,9042774,Katie,"Tayyab was warm, welcoming, helpful and communicative. His space is open and full of light, as well as other adornments from his travels. The bed was SO comfy. Thank you!"
2110357,43023574,2015-08-17,25489646,Peter,"Tayyab war bei unserer Ankunft persönlich vor Ort. Da wir später als geplant ankamen und unser Leihauto nicht mehr zurückgeben konnten, organisierte Tayyab einen sicheren Tiefgaragenplatz. Er gab uns gute Tips für die zwei Tage in Seattle. Die Unterkunft war wie beschrieben, lag zentral und bot eine tolle Sicht auf Seattle. Alles war bestens!"
2110357,43356661,2015-08-19,31985886,Michael,"Incredible view. Clean room, fresh sheets and a superb mattress. Professor Mahmud is the epitome of a good host. If I'm ever back in Seattle his room is the first room I'll try to book."
2110357,43894487,2015-08-23,3337751,Michael,Tayyab was great and immediately made us feel welcome.   He offered very useful advice.  The apartment was exactly as described and very good value.

2110357,44960489,2015-08-30,39384373,Matthew,"This was my first AirBnB experience and I'm glad Dr. Mahmud was our host. I'd highly recommend him. He was very friendly, polite, considerate, and recommended a great breakfast place (Lucky's!) for me and my dad. We had a later check-in that he was able to accommodate. His place is very neat and clean. The view is amazing. "
2110357,45265503,2015-09-01,18724723,Sonia,"What a lovely home! Stayed in Prof. Mahmud's apartment at the end of August and it was an absolutely wonderful stay. The view from the balcony and guest bedroom is absolutely incredible! Prof. Mahmud was also extremely welcoming and very helpful. The apartment is very clean and quiet and is in the best location if you want to see the tourist attractions in Seattle! Just a couple minutes walk from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, and Chihuly Gardens (Seattle Centre), only 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market. "
2110357,45553262,2015-09-04,4070146,Robert,"Wow. Staying with Tayyab was and incredible experience. He is very friendly and made us feel right at home. The space needle wasn't high on our list of things to see in Seattle, but it sure was a pleasure to have it just outside our bedroom window. Tayyab's home is clean, comfortable, beautiful and well located. He also has a great library. We would absolutely stay there again, and we would love to return the favor of he ever travels to our neck of the woods.  Six stars on a scale of one to five."
2110357,45772613,2015-09-06,28052092,Michael,"Tayyab was a most welcoming host he was friendly but not intrusive. The apartment was as described, very comfortable with spectacular views .
He was relaxed about our coming and going to the apartment and offered advice on the places we could visit. This was very helpful. The apartment was close to restaurants and within walking distance to Seattle. This made our short stay eventful as we were able to visit our selected destination easily.
Tayyab made our visit very enjoyable and we would recommend his hospitality to anyone visiting Seattle."
2110357,45987137,2015-09-07,19196566,Jessica,Tayyab was a very friendly helpful host. He had an amazing view of the Space Needle and Puget Sound. It was the perfect location and we absolutely enjoyed our stay.
2110357,46298655,2015-09-09,8641465,Jin,Dr Mahmud waited for us at the lobby when we arrived his place and guided us to his place. He explained detail about his place that we can be comfortable during our stay. His listing description was accurate and his place is a lot more awesome than the pictures. The neighborhood was clean and located nearby public transportation stops. We enjoyed staying at his place. 
2110357,46493457,2015-09-11,34627269,Jim,Good location with great views. Close to Space Needle and Seattle Centre.

2110357,47463961,2015-09-19,15496991,Katie,"Absolutely amazing! Excellent communication ahead of time making the process very smooth, especially for our first AirBnb experience.

2110357,47620683,2015-09-21,25243770,Larry,"Dr. Mahmud (Tayyab) sent detailed instructions regarding arrival and entrance to his beautiful accommodation and he met us as we arrived (even though Seattle weather was nice and he could have been outside enjoying it!).
The view from the private room is amazing - day & night. We felt welcome and comfortable. The accommodation is located in Bell Town area with great access to great eateries, coffee shops & less than a mile to Pike Market area - very convenient for walking and getting exercise. My wife & I won't hesitate to request this accommodation again in the future. "
2110357,47750587,2015-09-21,42204152,George,"I stayed only one night, but would seriously consider a longer stay the next time I visit Seattle. The host was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about Seattle. My suite was very comfortable and quiet with private bath and an awesome view. The apartment is tastefully decorated and comfortable and amazingly located for tourism of the waterfront and Space Needle attractions."
2110357,48063787,2015-09-23,34302206,Jocelyn,"Being newcomers to AirBnB, we weren't too sure what to expect other than what we researched. I have to say, it was a smooth and easy experience and Tayyab definitely was an instrumental part. He was very courteous and helped make our stay a memorable one. Beautiful and peaceful balcony views overlooking the water and with the space needle within a block and serving as a backyard view, it is hard to go wrong with this location. It is also close to pike market. I would stay at Tayyab's again, should our journeys ever lead us back to Seattle."
2110357,48471505,2015-09-26,29542297,Li,good location，friendly host，it will be more amazing if it including the breakfast.
2110357,48864006,2015-09-29,33189887,Nathalie,Walking in to our room we were absolutely amazed by the beautiful view of the Seattle nightscape.

2110357,49807932,2015-10-06,40303368,Anthony,Excellent stay with a very hospitable host. The location is perfect and the view of the Space Needle from your room cannot be beat. Will stay again next time in Seattle.
2110357,50099939,2015-10-09,39914637,Fei,"It's really a warm apartment with wonderful view.,Especially every morning I woke up. The family of Dr Mahmud are very accommodating,gave us helpful guidance so that we didn't waste any time during the trip in Seattle."
2110357,50922561,2015-10-16,9760667,Rene,"Dr. Mahmud was very friendly. The room has a great view of the Space Needle and downtown. It was perfect for me, the internet was fast, the bathroom clean and I had a desk where I worked. I didn't want to leave the room.

There are restaurants and coffee shops at walking distance and bus stops a couple of blocks away. "

2110357,51535621,2015-10-21,10505552,Tanja,"Tayyab Mahmud was een goede gastheer en kamer was ontzettend fijn. Prettig dat er een apart badkamertje bij hoorde. De locatie (het uitzicht!) is perfect, in de hippe buurt van Seattle en een prima uitvalsbasis om de rest van de stad te verkennen.  "
2110357,51804239,2015-10-24,44689024,Cari,"I can't believe how beautiful the view is!  Great host, very thorough and helpful!"
2110357,52177916,2015-10-26,44384788,Ivan,"First experience with airbnb was more than positive. Tayyab was very welcoming, assertive and helpful. We enjoyed staying in his home on the 20th floor with a view of space needle. Thank you Dr. Mahmud"
2110357,52448622,2015-10-29,9637203,Lauren,"You could not ask for a better place to stay in Seattle! I loved waking up and falling asleep to the Space Needle, and Puget Sound is breathtaking in the morning! Tayyab is a great host and made me feel totally comfortable. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I'd definitely want to stay here again."
2110357,52633228,2015-10-31,14495156,Evelyn,"We had a wonderful stay in Dr. Mahmud’s condo in Seattle.  I can echo what others have said:  Wow, what a view!  I never got used to seeing the Space Needle right out of our bedroom window.  Beyond the view, we found our accommodations to be perfectly suited to our needs:  super comfortable bed; private bathroom with plenty of hot water; inviting and quiet surroundings; access to a microwave for making tea; wireless.  In addition, Dr. Mahmud is a superb host.  He communicated in a timely and thorough manner, anticipating future needs, and he was welcoming and engaging.  We felt “at home” in the big city, and found it simple to get downtown by picking up the monorail or using bus.  After a long day of sightseeing, we could come back to the condo to relax a bit and then dine nearby at one of the many Belltown restaurants.  What a treat to enjoy independent but personal-touch lodging rather than an anonymous hotel stay."
2110357,52867164,2015-11-02,42145692,Jamie,This room has an awesome view of Seattle. The room was what you typically expect but also extremely comfortable. Great for walking to anything downtown. He gives you easy instructions before you get there on accessing the room. I had a great stay overall and would recommend this place.
2110357,53708647,2015-11-11,1855473,Dana & Alan,"What a fabulous spot! First off is the view, of course. Stunning. But there are so many more great details: the bed is Uber comfy, the sheets are to die for, the walls are lined with books on so many topics and Tayyab is thoughtful, detailed and gracious. Unfortunately, I could only spend 1 night on the way to Victoria, but my husband and I are already making plans to return!"
2110357,54219792,2015-11-16,22737731,Halu,"It was great experience to stay this place! Great location and fantastic view from the bedroom. Mr. Mahmoud made me very comfortable stay. It is only 5 min walk distance to The Space Needle, Chihuly glass museum and the Sculpture Park where I loved to visit. Highly recommend this place!"
2110357,54850830,2015-11-25,43535233,Christine,The view was amazing! We were close to everything we wanted to visit and it was a great deal! 
2110357,55371932,2015-12-01,44829898,Thierry,"Ma première expérience Airbnb est une déception :-(
L'appartement était tel que le décrivait l'annonce, bien situé, et la chambre parfaire. En revanche je ne me suis pas du tout senti bien accueilli et n'ai pratiquement pas du tout communiqué avec mon hôte.
Pour moi cet hôte ne fait que du business, uniquement. Aucun échange m'ayant permis d'être à l'aise, discuter de la ville, de ma visite au Canada. Même pas un verre d'eau ou un café. L'hôtel est beaucoup plus convivial."
2110357,55633856,2015-12-03,4008878,James,It was great! Very nice house in a fantastic location. 
2110357,55747151,2015-12-05,2779882,Marcus,"I think this was my 4th stay with Tayyab.  He's a great host.  I'm usually on a quick business trip, arriving late and leaving early. I always get a good night's rest and a great view of the Seattle skyline.  What more could I ask for?!"
2110357,56199165,2015-12-10,24171816,Beth,"Excellent view, easy to find, amazing location! Couldn't have been any better!"
2110357,56286857,2015-12-11,48949939,Shravan,Tayyab is an amazing host. He makes sure his guests are very comfortable. I really enjoyed my 2 day stay there. I would recommend him to anyone. Super host for a reason.
2110357,56315158,2015-12-12,39288626,Jonathan,Had a seamless stay at Tayyab's apartment. As many others have stated the views are breathtaking. He communicated well with us.
2110357,56398483,2015-12-13,2939402,Stuart,"Tayyab was very warm and helpful.  On arrival, he was there for me to ask quesitons and gave me some good pointers for nearby restuarants.  He is a wonderful host.

As for the room, it is well appointed with it own private bath.  The best part is that you have an amazing view of the Space Needle as you lie down in the bed.   No need for TV because you have this breathtaking view!  

I highly recommend the room and the host!

"
2110357,56520597,2015-12-14,29483304,Seva,"Tayyab is a nice guy with a great apartment in Seattle. I enjoyed the hospitality and the stunning views. We also had some good chats about life and diet. Ad a guest there you should expect to interact with your hosts since the living room where he spends some of his time is right next to the room, but again he is a great host to interact with :) "
2110357,56777543,2015-12-18,33188405,Sean,"My stay with Tayyab was amazing. The apartment was well equipped and spotless. The views of Seattle from the bedroom and other areas of the apartment are simply breathtaking, with Puget Sound, Queen Anne and the Space Needle all clearly visible. The location is excellent, with the Seattle Centre a 3 minute walk away, a bus stop on the next block and the light rail stop just a few blocks away. There are also plenty of helpful amenities nearby such as supermarkets and restaurants. "
2110357,57038108,2015-12-21,1855473,Dana & Alan,"Tayyab is amazing! He is the consummate host, going out of his way to help us make our stay in Seattle easy and fun. He has the BEST sheets and mattress and is super interesting to talk to."
5249093,28792993,2015-03-30,26928334,Branden,Amazing location so it was very convenient getting anywhere. Situated right in between Pikes Place Market and Capitol Hill. The condo was spacious and clean and was incredibly comfortable. It looked just like the listing. The host was quick to respond and incredibly helpful and accommodating when it came to small requests. Would definitely stay again.
5249093,30136878,2015-04-18,2513550,Karla,"We had a lovely time at the Elektra! The location is definitely it's best asset. The condo is amazingly well-situated, within walking distance of Seattle's best neighbourhoods and attractions. Worked well for our group.  Thanks for a great stay!"
5249093,31175924,2015-05-03,15772293,Eric,"Rebecca was very helpful during the booking process. We had a few specific questions to make sure that the apartment would work for our party of 4 attending a conference at the Washington State Convention center, which is literally around the corner and a block away. Also within walking distance from many coffee shops and a quick walk down to the Pike Place Market. The location was totally perfect for us. We met Doug at check-in who showed us around the apartment and gave us the rundown of logistics. We were on time and so was he, so that went perfectly smoothly as well. The apartment itself had a good view of the city, and worked well for our business trip, as well as a ""home base"" where we could eat and relax."
5249093,31789893,2015-05-10,12250320,Garrett,"Check-in was easy, and we were well and quickly met by the property manager who showed us the ins and outs of the condo.
Lovely location, lovely space. All the amenities you could want (fully-stocked kitchen, wifi, 2 bathrooms, extra towels), beautiful views of downtown Seattle, clean, and easy to access. "
5249093,34411548,2015-06-08,4140759,Mihir,We had a great time in Seattle at the 2 bedroom condo hosted by Rebecca and Doug. They were very helpful in getting us settled in and provided information about the neighborhood. The condo is very close to a lot of eating/drinking/shopping options as well as walking distance to the Pike Place Public Market. 
5249093,36217880,2015-06-26,28584815,Charles,"Our stay was terrific! Everything was well organized, and I feel confident if there had been any issues, hosts were nearby to handle things. Would definitely stay again."
5249093,40716723,2015-08-02,30017894,Patricia,"We arrived by train from the airport thanks to the host's great directions.  We were met and shown the apartment, great service! The location of the apartment was perfect for us, we walked everywhere.  Our apartment was well appointed with everything we needed.  Good beds, nice furnishings and a killer view!"
5249093,41320921,2015-08-07,29965404,Rachel,"Rebecca's place was perfect for us! The location was central to downtown, but quiet, clean and very comfortable. We are 2 adults and 2 teens and the sleeping arrangements and having 2 bathrooms was great. Rebecca and Doug were extremely responsive and helpful. We had an amazing time, thank you!!  "
5249093,42509461,2015-08-14,1329969,Joke,"

We were with 7 people in rebecca's two 2-bed appartments for a conference in the convention Center. It was perfect, the apartments were clean, big, comfortable and the location for us was perfect! By day we could hop in and out of the apartment during conference breaks, and in the night we were so close to Capitol Hill, where there are numerous great restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend!
"
5249093,43358978,2015-08-19,28871107,David,"The apartment was nice and clean, if not just a bit older than I expected. A quirky layout but very comfortable.

The surrounding neighborhood had some nice restaurants and was very centrally located. It also felt like a safe neighborhood.

I would enjoy staying here again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
5249093,44443380,2015-08-26,38796128,Al,"Very nice location and condo unit! The condo is surprising quiet inside even though it's close to the freeway.
Rebecca and Doug are very responsive and accommodating. Seattle is a great city and a wonderful place to visit. The location of this condo is perfect for exploring all the city has to offer!
Very comfortable place to stay for 4 people.
Highly recommend staying here!"
5249093,45053563,2015-08-31,4666568,Dan,"Clean, comfortable and convenient; host was quick to reply and accommodating."
5249093,45464214,2015-09-03,4823691,Lyn,"Excellent service from both Doug and Rebecca.  Host was prompt in attending to all queries and accomodating of our requests.  Apartment sleeps 4 comfortably and is a short 15 min walk to downtown Seattle.   There is noise from the freeway if you need to open windows, otherwise a quiet and relaxing apartment with a great view of the city lights.  Would definitely book through these hosts again."
5249093,45925918,2015-09-07,3563035,Sally,"Thanks, Rebecca and Doug. We five girlfriends had a great time at your place! Everything was comfortable, clean and convenient to shipping, restaurants, coffee, and even things from Pike Market just a half block away. Many thanks for making our Labor Day weekend adventure so much fun for us. Doug your welcome and good suggestions got is started on the right foot. "
5249093,46603835,2015-09-12,19755036,Megan,"We had a great time staying in Seattle for a conference.  The condo was located across the street from the conference center--a perfect location!  The condo is also located on one of the top floors and has a fantastic view of downtown Seattle.  It is a great location for exploring downtown Seattle.  Rebecca and her staff were very easy to work with and very helpful.  They were flexible on check in and check out time and provided information  on things to do around the city.    They also helped us find parking when we arrived to drop off our luggage.  The condo also had various magazines with suggestions for great Seattle restaurants.  The condo was quite large, especially for a downtown location.

Unfortunately, the summer in Seattle has been unseasonably warm and the condo does not have central air.  They had provided 2 portable air conditioners for the living room as well as multiple fans for the bedrooms and bathroom.  We did find that the bedroom with the king size bed became very stuffy with a strange odor when the door was closed, even with the fans on (and our luggage in another room).  This improved with leaving the door open at all times.  Perhaps a dehumidifier or another portable AC unit would improve the air flow issues.

There were also several stains on the top and bottom of King size bed comforter so we did not use the comforter during the stay (we didn't really need it because of the weather, anyway).  

Overall, the location was amazing and can't be beat for the price.  The stay could be made even more comfortable with the above mentioned improvements.  Thanks for a great time!"
5249093,47674738,2015-09-21,34824875,Derrick,"The host was amazing and I couldn't ask for more!  The condo was as expected, and we were very comfortable.  Great condo, and great hosts!"
5249093,48991621,2015-09-30,37070348,Tanner,"Great location and a very nice apartment. Comfortably fit 4 for sleeping and a few more friends for 'hangouts' in the living room. Being right across from the Convention Centre was very handy, only a two minute walk to get to our conference. "
5249093,49431079,2015-10-04,30471237,James,"Our place was perfect, located within walking distance of all the tourist attractions. Staying together as a family in one place made our trip that much more special. Thanks for the hospitality "

5249093,51113915,2015-10-18,36633548,Mona,"Everything was great!  They recommended a shuttle service that brought us right to the door and Doug met us there and went over everything.  The condo was clean, comfortable, and centrally located.  They gave us suggestions of places to go and said everything was within walking distance, which it easily was!  The TV, Netflix, and WiFi were easy to use with no problems at all.  The beds were comfy, there was a great view, and it was the perfect ""home away from home"" for our ""girls' weekend"" getaway!  Thanks!  "
5249093,51889995,2015-10-25,38293394,Lisa,"The 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment was exactly as described.  Both Becky and Doug were wonderful to work with. Doug welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around.  You can't beat the location perfectly situated downtown within minutes of major attractions.  I highly recommend the apartment for exploring Seattle!"
5249093,52673047,2015-11-01,34546084,Martin,"The apartment is real close to the Washington State Convention Centre and extremely convenient to Downtown.

"
5249093,53317417,2015-11-08,1623867,Joe,Amazing location and cute condo with great views! Hosts were very friendly and accommodating. Definitely would stay here again.
5249093,54123519,2015-11-16,46099552,Sue,"Rebecca was great at returning emails and answering all our questions. Doug was there to great us and made us feel right at home. The apartment was very nice and spacious.  We were four gals who get together yearly and we wanted something more comfortable than a hotel and this fit the bill!!  The view is great.  The best part is how centrally located it was to everything downtown, especially the light rail that was about 6 blocks away.  Having two bathrooms was perfect!  
We would recommend Rebecca and Doug's Airbnb anytime!!  "
5249093,54794385,2015-11-23,12037937,Wu,此房源地段好，离太空针，渔夫市场都很近，在一栋公寓房内。然而屋内陈设陈旧，没有照片上拍出来的感觉那么漂亮。我们临走时忘了拿卫生间镜柜里的化妆品，当晚就和房东委派的管理员联系，却被告知找不到了，损失很大，是二个人所有的化妆护肤品，这是一次不愉快的airbnb经历，以后不会入住bnb，没有宾馆安全和干净，住客权益得不到保障。
5249093,55710357,2015-12-05,28578178,Judith,Doug and Rebecca made check in super easy. The apartment is in a fabulous location with equally as good access to the Capital Hill neighborhood as well as the convention center and downtown areas. The apartment was comfortable with all the amenties one needs for a home away from home experience.  The bathroom and kitchens were spotless and the beds were super comfortable.
5249093,58115659,2016-01-01,16754528,Katie,"The apartment was fantastic with a beautiful view of the Seattle skyline. The space was perfect for our trip with 4 adults and a baby. The location was super central. Check in was very easy, and everyone was great to work with. We'd definitely stay here again!"
7949448,44382509,2015-08-25,11563002,Claudia,"This space is adorable and exactly as it appears in the listing! Great decor, well appointed, and very clean. The outdoor patio is great, and the hosts were very thoughtful - leaving us waters, coffee, and other details to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. The room is on the small side, but perfect for 1-2 people. However, by far the best part (at least for us) was the fabulous location in ""Frelard"" - walking distance to both the Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods of Seattle, which made for the ideal hub for getting to know these two fabulous little ""hoods""! Definitely recommend this hidden gem!"
7949448,46198041,2015-09-08,23073510,Ashley,"This place was exactly what was promised, and suited our trip perfectly. We loved the autonomous feeling, and total privacy. Great touches in the room, like a bottle of wine and toiletries (even bandaids!), were much appreciated."
7949448,46767752,2015-09-13,23967683,Cristian,"I had great experience staying at Jason's house. He was always very helpful and answered my queries on the spot, I was very delayed to do my check in and was always replying to my emails within minutes. 
The check-in information for the room he sent me was clear and concise and he was very keen on offering information of Seattle and activities around the area.

The room was sparkling clean, with immaculate fluffy carpet and spotless bathroom; and everything matched up with the descriptions and photos. 
The bed and the bed linen were superb (better than the bed of the Sheraton Seattle Downtown I was staying before) and so were the towels and the toiletries provided (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand wash, etc).
The room has a complimentary coffee machine with coffee capsules of several varieties.
It also has an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, a fridge, a tray with cups and wine glasses and additional towels and pillows stored in a big closet with room for your luggage and several hangers provided.
The shower was also great with plenty of hot water pressure and massage function in the shower head.
The room has loads of natural light and air circulation, the access is very private via an independent side entrance to a lovey garden that you can also use.
The neighbourhood is lovely, well connected, close to nice coffee shops and restaurants and seemed very safe too.

I can't recommend enough to stay at Jason's place, so much so that next time I am in Seattle I will definitively stay there again.

So thank you very much Jason for making my stay in Seattle a very pleasant experience.
"
7949448,48107228,2015-09-23,5304409,Masha,"If you're planning a trip to Seattle- Jason's place is where you should definitely stay! Everything is perfect about it:) It's located between two most amazing neighborhoods in Seattle- Fremont & Ballard. You can walk to either one (or take a bus, which is a 1-minute walk) and enjoy their beauty, cafes, coffee shops, picturesque streets & great bbq places. Or you can take a bus to the city center & enjoy everything Seattle has to offer. The room itself is very-very cute, bright, cozy, clean, private. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom has all basic toiletries, there's even a coffee machine & a mini fridge in the room! You can use an outdoor patio if the weather is good of course, and we often had breakfast there, it was very romantic. Jason is a wonderful host! He answers all the questions you might have, gives you many recommendations as to where to eat and/or have a beer, he always responds to you very quickly & promptly. Our experience with him was purely positive & we would highly recommend him as a host!"
7949448,49233335,2015-10-02,42319661,Joe,"We had a wonderful time at Jason's place near the fun Fremont neighborhood! Within very close walking distance to bus stop and a great brewery. The room was just as we expected from the pictures...clean, bright, and well stocked with coffee supplies and some toiletries if needed. We appreciated the extra closet space as well. "
7949448,50010380,2015-10-08,247687,Carmelle,"Loved the feeling of simple luxury! Its a small room but so comfortable, elegant and cozy and the closet is so big-it was perfect! I felt very at home, everything was very clean and decorated like a modern hotel-neutral palette and lots of comfortable luxury. The location is perfect-short walk to great shopping/restaurants. It IS as lovely as the photos! I never had time to meet my hosts in person but they were very easy to deal with and made me feel welcome and very well cared for. After a day of travel I finally arrived and just wanted to relax...and it was wonderful to have a  luxurious bed, a  bottle of wine and a flat screen with such a choice of channels waiting for me. The next morning I got up, drank the bottle of water they provided and had a very short walk to a great place for breakfast. They provided a hairdryer, iron, shower amenities galore-and a Keurig! I was very glad I found this place!"
7949448,50548697,2015-10-12,24308317,Elaine,"We loved staying at Jason's home!  The space was clean, beautifully decorated and in a perfect location,  just a quick ride to downtown.  Jason was a fantastic host, quick to reply and provided easy directions for checking in.   Very private space, perfect for a couple or single traveler.  
Jason also provided great recommendations for the area which we enjoyed exploring.  We'll be sure to return to Seattle and would love to stay here again!  "
7949448,51190104,2015-10-18,32360309,Laurie,"Very clean, nice room and bathroom.  Patio area is nice as well.  Convenient location and hosts were prompt in answering any questions.  Thanks!"
7949448,52247130,2015-10-27,25330607,Jake,"Jason's private room was a comfortable and gorgeous destination — it was perfect for me and my significant other's weekend getaway. His home, courtyard, and overall property was a clean, modern, and exciting experience. When we arrived he stocked the room with coffee, wine, and all living necessities we may need which allowed us the ability to relax and soak in the culture that is Seattle without worrying about a thing!  The neighborhood is extremely quiet and family friendly, with anything you may need, or want, within walking distance. We could not be happier with our choice to stay here and we would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quiet, private and relaxing Seattle stay. "
7949448,53560368,2015-11-09,27331265,Brad,"Jason's place was great! I've never been to Seattle, but my experience was excellent. The location was perfect, and I had a great amount of privacy. They are a wonderful host, everything was very comfortable. I highly recommend staying here!"
7949448,55144439,2015-11-28,10620,Pisay,"There's nothing I can say about Jason's suite that hasn't already been said by other Airbnb guests. The room is exactly as pictured -right down to the little round pillow & throw. I didn't find a bottle of wine as some other guests have but I did find some extra complimentary toiletries in the closet that came in very handy. The room is on the small side but it is private and has great light. It's also perfectly situated between two of Seattle's best neighborhoods -Ballard and Fremont. I was able to walk to the center of both in about 15-20 minutes, while Downtown Seattle is just a short bus ride away. However, the best thing about Jason's suite is Jason. There was a  miscommunication about my arrival date and Jason wasn't ready for me when I showed up. I couldn't help but be a little worried as it was 12am in the morning and I had communicated to him that I would be arriving late. Needless to say he felt really bad about it and refunded me for the one night even though I had a perfectly sound sleep in their wonderful bed. I really appreciated that Jason took this extra step to make sure that I was comfortable and enjoyed my stay. "
1049293,37105060,2015-07-04,10354256,Yi Jie,"It is a clean, cozy apartment for two and everything looks the same as what we saw from the pictures. There is a huge backyard that we enjoyed especially during the evening.  The location is good where shops and restaurants are within walking distance from the house; and the bus stop to downtown is only 10 mins walking distance from the house. The neighborhood is quiet and filled with beautiful houses. It is nice to have an evening walk around this area.

Marlow and her husband is really nice and friendly. We didn't talk a lot but they gave us the privacy that we needed. We really had an enjoyable stay in their apartment. Will want to come back in the future."
1049293,37508605,2015-07-07,679232,Scott,"This place is awesome. An amazingly beautiful (and quiet) neighborhood in the heart of the Capital Hill neighborhood. This is a great jumping off point to almost anywhere in Seattle (walking or driving). You can walk to just about any location in the central part of the city. Downtown and the Space Needle are only 2 miles away. However, there are tons of amazing cafes, restaurants, bars and shops only a few blocks away. 

The apartment is super charming, quiet and cozy. A serene place to return to after engaging with the hustle and bustle of a big city. I would certainly recommend Marlow's apartment for anyone seeking a quiet location and recharging rest."
1049293,38174248,2015-07-13,36468828,Kathryn,It was a warm and inviting neighborhood.  The location was quiet with convenient parking.  I really enjoyed the Dunkin' Donuts fresh ground coffee that was provided.
1049293,39411050,2015-07-23,36494268,Ryan,"Located in a gorgeous residential neighborhood of north-central Capitol Hill. Quiet, and still within walking distance of all the fantastic restaurants and stores that Cap Hill has to offer. Not to mention Volunteer Park, which is a short stroll away. The property and guest living area is as described: comfortable, private, with a nice array of amenities including a separate kitchen area, bedroom, bathroom, sitting area, and WiFi. Easy come and go when we wanted via a private entrance in the back yard. Thank you for the stay!"
1049293,39960407,2015-07-27,36142100,Srikant,"I liked how self sufficiently everything was setup. The accommodation was in the back. The check in & entry instructions were clear so you didn't have to depend on the people in the house for entry/re-entry. The bed was comfortable. The closet was convenient. They provided fresh towels & toiletries. The kitchen was great. We were very comfortable there. And the Capitol Hill area is just so beautiful.
The only negatives I suppose were  - the shower was too tiny; the tile flooring was a bit cold & slippery (at least after a shower); and occasionally you'd hear the footsteps from upstairs (it felt louder than it was because the area is so quiet). There was no AC, but they did provide a fan that did a decent job. I do like to have the windows open so I feel a little less claustrophobic & get some air circulation going (that's just me), so I had to open those heavy windows & setup the mesh. That took a bit of effort. 
But still overall I'd say none of the negatives were so serious that it as a deal breaker. If anything our experience there was quite pleasant. I'd give it a thumbs up just for the area that it is situated in."
1049293,41389800,2015-08-07,2045160,Charles,"This was a charming house in a nice neighborhood with Victorian homes.  Arriving after midnight, we were welcomed by decorative lights in the entry way and lights inside too.  The rooms were nicely furnished and comfortable.  Marlowe gave us our personal space while there but when we crossed paths was helpful and personable.  She gave us suggestions for memorable local dining too.  The kitchen was plenty adequate for simple meals and the step up into the bathroom was easy to get used to.  Parking was never a problem and felt our car was safe and secure.  We'd stay there again and recommend it to others."
1049293,43801703,2015-08-22,34361705,Elyse,"We felt very welcomed in Marlow's space, and we loved every minute. It's such a beautiful space and the most gorgeous Seattle neighborhood. It was such a treat to stay in Capitol Hill and be surrounded by such beauty. The ""apartment"" (bedroom bathroom, living area, and kitchen!) was very spacious and had everything we needed! It was extremely clean with fresh towels and shampoo, conditioner, and soap, and there were clear instructions on basic maintenance (trash, recycling, etc.) per City of Seattle rules. It is very close to a bus stop with a route directly downtown, so a rental car wasn't necessary. There is also an incredible cafe only 2 blocks away (plus busy Capitol Hill restaurants very near), and Volunteer Park is such a lovely walk only a few blocks away. It's the PERFECT location for a peaceful and fun stay in Seattle, if you want to be out of the busy downtown area. We did end up renting a car because we drove to our next destination, and parking was NO problem on Marlow's street, so know that it's a great option, too. Overall, the place was gorgeous, unique, and in a great location!"
794633,4441483,2013-05-05,6204584,Silas,"Great space, good location, gracious host.  Left us a bottle of wine when we checked in.  Highly recommended!  "
794633,4604524,2013-05-14,6204750,Lisa,"This studio apartment was very modern, comfortable and clean. The bed was super comfortable and big. The location is excellent. The neighborhood was very quiet and private."
794633,4656834,2013-05-18,5243158,Miles,"Stayed here for two nights. Place was quiet, clean, safe, and pleasant. Definitely a nice retreat in a busy city. Julius was easy to get in touch with and friendly. Recommended. "
794633,4794623,2013-05-26,675239,Heather,"A wonderful place to stay for a visit to Seattle! Great location, easy to find, is exactly as listed. We loved the neighborhood, it was nice to walk to the bakery up the street each morning for breakfast. "
794633,4881705,2013-05-30,6430256,Mercedes,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and we couldn't be more pleased. Julius's place was super clean and so cozy. Very well decorated as well. The neighborhood is really nice with lots of restaurants in walking distance. The bed was really comfy. After camping for a couple days, that comfy bed was just what I needed. :)  I did not once feel like I was staying in someone's backyard,we felt like we were in our own little private cottage. We definitely want to explore more of Seattle and would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
794633,4911249,2013-06-01,4603758,Rachel,"Great place to stay in Seattle. Good location, some nice places to eat. Very clean and comfortable stay!"
794633,4946304,2013-06-03,5112982,Jessica,"great place, modern and impeccable, convenient location, and very kind host! highly recommended!"
794633,4985173,2013-06-05,5694290,Andrew,"Julius' home is a quiet sanctuary. We stayed here after a long, exhausting 3 day drive to Seattle. It was the perfect choice. The house is a great size, everything is new and spotless. You can't beat the neighborhood. Its adjacent to everything you could ever want and yet it feels so private and secluded. I would highly recommend staying here. "
794633,5039580,2013-06-09,6005370,Nicole,"My stay here was an excellent introduction to AirBnB. Julius was extremely responsive to questions and readily provided all the info I needed for my stay. The pictures of the unit are spot on, everything is designed with a smaller house in mind, so the entire space, though small is extremely functional and feels spacious. When I arrived everything was very tidy and the kitchenette was well stocked with utensils and dishes. The location is great too, Madison Valley is a lovely neighborhood with restaurants, coffeeshops and groceries conveniently nearby. It was also very easy to hop on a bus (there are multiple nearby lines) to downtown. I would (and am happily planning) to stay here again. Julius was a great host and this is a wonderful space for a stay in Seattle."
794633,5086293,2013-06-11,2392432,Amanda,"Julius is an excellent host, he was very responsive and communicated details for our reservation so that our stay was easy and seamless. The cottage is very clean and spacious, we had a very comfortable, enjoyable stay!"
794633,5230029,2013-06-19,4227017,Mary,"The unit is attractive, clean, comfortable and private.  Julius made sure we had everything we needed and more.  We will definitely stay in this same unit when we return to Seattle later this year.  This was our first stay with airbnb and was a very positive experience."
794633,5282703,2013-06-22,358236,Jeff,This was a great place. Clean and comfortable. Beautiful setting in a nice quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended. The combination lock makes access easy. Julius is a very accommodating host. Would definitely stay here again. 
794633,5348039,2013-06-25,6621953,Lara,"This is a cute little house you can use for yourself, incl a nice decoration. Downtown is just a jump by car and check in was the easiest I have experienced with air bnb. We will definitely come back! Thank you for making this possible! Highly recommended."
794633,5385068,2013-06-27,6676827,Chris,"The detached unit was perfect for the two of us. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. The bottle of wine left by Julius was a wonderful gesture. We loved the area, quiet, yet close to downtown. Julius was a very helpful, friendly host. He gave us our privacy but was only a text away if we needed anything. 
We would definitely return if we visit Seattle again."
794633,9724638,2014-01-06,6670428,James,"Location, location, location! Please remember that when you are visiting Seattle. This place is just outside of Capitol Hill and I was able to drive anywhere (Seattle Center, U-District, Downtown, CenturyLink Filed, etc) within a short distance. Place was very quiet and parking was plenty! It had more than enough room for one person. Julius was always available if I needed anything. Would definitely stay here again."
794633,9751941,2014-01-07,10901993,Jill,"My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay at the last minute and Julius came to our rescue! He was quick to respond and was very informative about the neighborhood, parking, etc.

The place is very comfortable, well decorated and very clean. And, added bonus...they have excellent taste in books! 

I definitely recommend staying a night or more here."
794633,9819778,2014-01-12,4611894,Michael & Mathew,"We enjoyed our stay in this private little cozy getaway. The bed was really comfortable and it has all the essentials. Great for a couple out to explore Seattle. We rented a car and were able to park out front and go anywhere we needed. The neighborhood was very nice and although we didn't meet Julius personally, he texted us to let us know he was there for anything we needed and was very pleasant! But, we really didn't need a thing and it's was great to just come right on in with the keypad and get out an explore. Thanks, Julius! We would definitely book here again. Great selection of books , btw. Thumbs up!  "
794633,9842964,2014-01-13,8003527,Geoffrey,"great apartment, terrific location and very good host, can't do much better.  I recommend this place for anyone visiting Seattle, Julius is a wonderful host and build a excellent rental unit."
794633,9855758,2014-01-14,10475510,Teresa,This is a great little place. Super sweet with all the conveniences one needs. 
794633,9883660,2014-01-16,4658416,Thomas,"We couldn't have been happier. A bargain - for the price, we would've had to stay in a four-star hotel for what we got, and even still, a four-star hotel wouldn't have been this clean and quiet. New space, well put together, and within 5 minutes (walking) of cafes and restaurants. Will definitely be our go-to next time we need to stay in Seattle.

Julius was great - he got back to us right away, was easily available by phone or email, but the room/bathroom had everything we needed so we never had to contact him!"
794633,9908718,2014-01-18,11264016,Dani,"This place was perfect! Cute neighborhood, easy parking, great place!! Julius was also very helpful... we didn't end up running into him, but he checked in on us, and offered suggestions and help getting around the city. Great place, and I'd recommend it to all my friends!! :)"
794633,9916751,2014-01-19,1711150,Joe,"Very cute, clean and cozy space.  Julius was quick to reply in setting up the reservation and with any questions I had in advance of my stay.  Would stay again, and recommend to others."
794633,9964920,2014-01-21,11024963,Shane,"The Place: This little house was awesome! Everything you could need to shack up for a few days. Modern, clean, comfortable - couldn't ask for much more. Oh, and the bed is AMAZING. And the surrounding area is perfect - if you feel like hitting Seattle's best spots, nothing is farther than a 15-20 min drive. If you'd rather not drive, there's plenty of parks and places to eat within a short walk.

The Host: Julius was great! Gave me plenty of ideas of where to go and what to do nearby. Was very available and always willing to answer questions. Thank you! What a great first Airbnb experience."
794633,9978319,2014-01-22,11187627,Hanna,"Great place, great neighborhood, comfy bed, good books! We really enjoyed our stay."
794633,10016186,2014-01-25,2170246,Tamsen,"This is a very clean and cozy cottage on private property in a central but neighborhoody part of Seattle.  Checking in and out was easy.  Bed was comfortable, and wifi was pretty reliable.

This has a mini-kitchen, meaning a microwave and an ample-sized fridge and limited dishes, which is probably fine for most travelers.

Julius was gracious in my one request for a kitchen item that was not in the unit, and was at my doorstep quickly to make sure I had what I needed."
794633,10080165,2014-01-29,4227017,Mary,"Other than staying with family, this is our favorite place to stay in Seattle.  It is attractive, clean, comfortable, private and quiet. Julius is prompt to answer or satisfy any question or request. He is a great host."
794633,10213934,2014-02-06,5400725,Taylor,"New favorite place to stay in Seattle on airbnb. Total privacy in clean spacious unit, plenty of room for two! Lots of parking on 30th, Jenna and I couldn't have been more pleased. We look forward to our return!"
794633,10226405,2014-02-07,9376693,Doug,Great find in a lovely Seattle neighborhood.  Julius was quick to communicate before and after the reservation was booked.
794633,10322099,2014-02-13,11017377,Ryan,"This was my first experience with airbnb. I cannot imagine staying in a hotel again. Julius was very responsive to me and provided wonderful accommodations for me and my 5 year old son.
A great neighborhood, with amazing food within walking distance.
I will be back and cannot recommend this little gem highly enough!"
794633,10428153,2014-02-18,11332236,Elizabeth,"This little cottage was great.  The host was friendly and helpful.  It was only a short walk to public transportation, coffee, food and shops.  Really liked the neighborhood. We didn't spend a lot of time there because we were out visiting with friends and family, but it was a great place to come back to.  The mini kitchen was useful and the décor was great.  This was our first airbnb experience and we would definitely do it again and recommend it.   "
794633,10472922,2014-02-20,12212909,Kerri,Julius was an awesome host! He gave quick answers to my questions and was very friendly. The guest house is absolutely adorable and has everything you need. It sits in the backyard of the main house which is also gorgeous. As 2 girls traveling alone we were very comfortable here and felt very safe. The keyless entry made coming and going very easy. The bed was so comfy! The location is awesome and there is plenty of parking in this beautiful neighborhood. My only regret was not finding this place sooner and booking my whole trip here!! I will definitely be back again and will recommend this place to my friends and family!!
794633,10499925,2014-02-22,11948899,Chris,"Fantastic place, great value, located in a nice quiet neighborhood very close to downtown Seattle.  I can't imagine how the stay could have been better."
794633,10518111,2014-02-23,11745200,Henry,"Very nice place. I'm just nitpicking since I have nothing bad to say... But to get to the place, you need to walk on grass to get to the entrance/door. Would be nice if inside the place had a floor mat for the dirty shoes. There was no hair dryer. With all that said, I would definitely stay here again. The place is stunning."
794633,10634500,2014-03-01,11010928,Andrea,"Perfect location, very clean and good access to public transportation service. Would stay there again :-)"
794633,10760806,2014-03-06,330828,Tiffany,I really enjoyed my stay at Julius's detached house! The house is located on a really quiet residential street about 10-15 minutes away from the bustle of downtown. The area surrounding the neighborhood seems very quiet too. We went for a walk one night up the hill and were admiring the beautiful houses and the view on top of the hill. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a quiet escape while visiting Seattle. Julius provided towels and dishes for us and I really liked having the hot kettle to use to heat up water since it was raining out. Everything was very clean and nothing looked worn out. 
794633,10787540,2014-03-07,9267199,Claudia,We had a great stay at Julius's cozy cottage!
794633,10900882,2014-03-12,20731,Tik,"This in-law unit was exactly what we were looking for.  It has a big bed, a refrigerator, a microwave, a private bathroom, and a small dining table.  The unit was just big enough for the two of us.  The only really minor thing about this unit is that there is a street lamp that shines right onto the bed.  We had to prop up a pillow to block a little of that light.  Some drapes over the top window in the unit would alleviate that minute detail.  I needed an iron and Julius was gracious enough to run on over with us within minutes of my text.  He told us to just keep the iron and just leave it in the unit when we left.  He went out of his way to give us our privacy and that is something worth mentioning.  He's a friendly guy and kindly asked when we were checking out so he can prepare for the next tenant.  We were running a little beyond the 11am checkout time, but we definitely planned to be back so we made it a point to clean up and check out as soon as possible after that.  Hope we didn't hinder your cleaning process, Julius!  Thanks for everything!  "
794633,11072185,2014-03-19,4803574,Natasha & Kurt,"My 5.5 year old and I stayed at Julius' backyard suite for 4 nights and were very happy with it!  The bed was very cozy and we slept so well.  It was very quiet at night which we appreciated.  The big bathtub was lovely and the mini fridge was great for snacks. The area felt very safe and parking was never a problem.
 We never met Julius as we were only at the suite to sleep, but he was very attentive with a text to check in and make sure all was going well.
We would stay here again for sure!"
794633,11110771,2014-03-21,206203,Amanda,"This is a sweet, very private cottage in a fantastic neighborhood with lots to share with travelers. If you are thinking of booking a hotel, this is a much nicer option. Check in and checkout was as simple as could be, and Julius is a caring responsive host. The kitchen is a bit sparse compared to many AIRBNB ""entire home or apartment"" so bring your own food and drinks but it is much better equipped than most any hotel. Check it out.
"
794633,11169774,2014-03-24,943807,Kimberly,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Julius' detached unit.  It was clean, full of comic books, and private.

Check-in and check-out were super smooth.

The neighborhood is great for walking around.  The arboretum was a a treat."
794633,11237986,2014-03-25,3763570,Dan,The ADU is very clean and comfortable. It's in a nice setting very close to a beautiful lake and arboretum. 
794633,11245434,2014-03-26,11395898,Blake,Julius' place was comfortable and clean. He was quick to respond. Nice neighborhood. Very affordable. I hope his place is available the next time I visit Seattle.
794633,11344135,2014-03-31,9610727,Jameela,My boyfriend and I stayed 4 nights in this rental home and enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We spent most of our time site seeing and ate out for all our meals. The location is great and close to many tourist sites and walking distance to nice restaurants. I would recommend this to someone taking a similar short trip.
794633,11544261,2014-04-07,11020066,Pierre,"We had a pleasant stay at Julius's home. Everything was very nice, very clean. The apartment is very well located. We were able to walk around and explore Seattle downtown and also Kirkland downton. 
Everything is easy via the bus network. You can book without hesitation. Thank you again and if it is possible, we will return!
See you soon.
Pierre & Francoise."
794633,11647165,2014-04-10,4058364,Christy,"What a sweet little place in a great neighborhood! I would stay here again. Clean, cozy, and comfortable. Thanks Julias."
794633,11671688,2014-04-11,13706717,Kris,"Perfect for what my parents needed. Clean, simple, beautifully decorated. No complaints. Our host gave the utmost privacy, but made it well known he was available for any needs! "
794633,11689684,2014-04-12,5075881,Matt,"Wonderful guest house. Comfortable and very quiet. Great bed--a king, I think. Easy street parking and, as described, a couple minute walk to great restaurants, bakeries and coffee shops. Fantastic!"
794633,11823197,2014-04-15,5837261,Breezy,"Julius was great host, and while we didn't get to officially meet him, he was helpful and communicative via text. His place feels private, modern, clean, and comfortable. We loved that we were able to bring our pug and have nice accommodations for a very reasonable price by Seattle standards. The location is great too!"
794633,11856863,2014-04-17,7968092,Kody,"There is nothing bad to be said about Julius and his amazing place. Check-in was as easy as it could be; the unit was impeccable and comfortable (amazing book selection, btw); location was primo (5 minutes to downtown). This was my first trip to Seattle and I had a blast. If I ever have the fortune to return, Julius' place will be my first stop. "
794633,11916041,2014-04-19,11724655,Sabih,The stay was excellent.  Bed is comfortable and the apartment is a good size.  The location is perfect and close to a lot of restaurants in Capitol Hill as well as easy access to the highways to get to the East side. Julius was very responsive when we needed anything.  Will be staying here again next time we visit! 
794633,12176595,2014-04-25,11907020,Amanda & Danny,"This is a very comfortable, quiet place to stay. It's just a short walk away from the Arboretum and some nice restaurants. Check-in was a breeze, and Julius was always very easy to get in touch with. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
794633,12273085,2014-04-28,12051870,Karel,"What a great cabin! It was clean, modern, private, and in a very wonderful neighborhood.  Julius is great host, and I would highly recommend this unit to anyone wishing to visit the Seattle area!!!"
794633,12378501,2014-04-30,14048371,Brian,Excellent place to stay while visiting Seattle! Julius was very easy to communicate with on airbnb. I highly recommend staying here and would do so again in the future.
794633,12501495,2014-05-04,7322436,Kevin,"A great place.  Quiet and tucked away but with easy access to local restaurants and the bus lines to downtown. Also close to Trader Joe's to pick up some things to keep in the unit.  Take a walk to downtown Madison Park and the beach, or just a block or so away is the Arboretum.  Julius was easy to stay in touch with and proactive in making sure everything was ok for my stay.  I would definitely use this listing again for future trips."
794633,12682505,2014-05-08,11671727,Wendy,"The unit is charming and private.  Our stay was comfortable and private, and conveniently close to all the activities we planned during our visit.  It was roomy and well decorated, had necessities and amenities provided.  We will recommend it to our friends who come to Seattle."
794633,12761196,2014-05-10,14855644,Danielle,"This was an excellent place to stay!!  Decor was upbeat,comfortable,and accommodating in every way.  Having the private entry behind the main house was easy.  My husband and I were visiting our son and this was close to his apartment and close to a great part of Madison.  We only booked for 2 nights before going to stay on Orcas Island for a few days and we were very disappointed not to be able to stay our last 2 nights in Seattle.  I loved the landscape!!  I am a gardener from Mississippi and I was very excited to see all the different plants in the garden around and behind this unit.  I will try to book this unit when we return for our next visit if our son is still in the area. Just for comparison: we stayed at Hotel Max our last 2 nights and it did not compare. "
794633,12885245,2014-05-13,5379262,Lea,Everything was as expected and communication went great.
794633,13203931,2014-05-21,6239263,Pam,"This was an amazing experience.  We took an impromptu trip to Seattle and booked the guest house the same day.  It was easy to get I with the keyless entry and Julius was really prompt on sending the code.  

Everything was clean and exactly as expected from the photos.

The house was situated in a really cute area and was really convenient.

I would recommend to anyone especially if they have a car.  Parking was perfectly easy in the neighborhood."
794633,13271935,2014-05-24,13203163,Scott,"My wife, dog, and I had a wonderful time in Seattle. The quiet neighborhood and clean, relaxing feel of this detached unit were a perfect respite from busy downtown Seattle. I will definitely be staying here again, hopefully soon!"
794633,13452653,2014-05-27,13160818,Shawn And Suzey,"We really enjoyed  our stay in Julius  detached unit in the Madison Valley neighborhood. It was clean, quiet and private. Really enjoyed the neighborhood shops, and its central location. Would definitley recommend and look forward to staying there again."
794633,13476600,2014-05-28,6822975,Sean,"Our stay in Madison Valley was great. Julius' private detached home was clean and organized, perfect for my wife and I. You could probably fit three of four sleeping, but it would be tight. The place is just around the corner from a nice bakery/breakfast spot, a vegan/vegetarian restaurant (which was great) and the busses to get you to city center or downtown. The electric lock on the door worked out great-no waiting for keys here! If we ever needed to stay in this part of Seattle again we will be booking with Julius."
794633,13608045,2014-06-01,5294890,Judy,"We enjoyed a quite comfortable stay at Julius's guest cottage.  It's nicely appointed, clean, and well maintained. While the cottage is conveniently located to shops and restaurants, it's on a small street, so it's very quiet and peaceful.  As a host, Julius was very responsive to my questions/requests. Would definitely stay there again."
794633,13647830,2014-06-02,11557726,Andrew,"We enjoyed staying here. The detached studio was very clean and comfortable. My wife and I stayed here for our wedding night. Julius was even kind enough to set up some rose petals on the bed that I had dropped off prior to our arrival. (I wanted to surprise my wife!) We would definitely recommend this place! It is a wonderful getaway spot, yet still very close to the city. "
794633,13772661,2014-06-03,11667246,Keith,"The place was great, I liked it alot"
794633,13855113,2014-06-06,6903423,Jasmine,"Such a fantastic stay in Madison Valley. Highly recommend this detached private unit (if you can find your needed dates! This place seems to book up quick...it's that awesome!). Julius was super friendly and easy to communicate with. Simple check-in and out. Lovely space that was very comfortable with a gorgeous back yard garden to look upon. Quick walk to amazing food - you must try the rosemary biscuits and (vegan) sage sausage country gravy at Cafe Flora. Yumm. Also, easy street parking no matter the time of day/night. Lovely little area of Seattle- we really enjoyed our stay at this cozy Airbnb. "
794633,13876262,2014-06-07,10370428,Chiaming,The room was very clean and cozy. We especially enjoyed the convenience of the keyless entry.
794633,13908516,2014-06-08,7642343,Sarah,"Loved staying at Julius' clean, cosy, unit. I wish I had more time in Seattle. Will definitely stay here again in the future. Transacting with Julius was a breeze and he is very helpful and accommodating. "
794633,14020897,2014-06-10,2873966,Dixie,"My friend and I loved the location and Julius was always prompt to assist us. We enjoyed walking around Madison Avenue and we had an excellent meal at a French restaurant called ""Voila"" .  The arboretum was a wonderful place to walk, the neighborhood was great. The bus system worked well for us to get downtown. I would definitely come back to Juluis' detached unit! "
794633,14147956,2014-06-13,5112089,Shawna,Julius was a great host. Super friendly and very quick to respond to any questions or requests that we had. The unit was super clean and well organized. The house is walking distance to restaurants and a bakery. 
794633,14260590,2014-06-16,5345856,Debra,"Perfect!  Even better than the pics!  Super-easy to find; completely walkable, safe, beautiful neighborhood; quiet, comfy, sprawling sleep on a king-sized bed w/tons of pillows; over-sized bathroom with great light - can't say enough good things!  Julius was very friendly and responsive too!  Highly recommend, and will be back next time I'm in Seattle to see family (also turned my family onto Julius' place, so sure they'll be employing it as well).  Thanks!  :  ]"
794633,14596560,2014-06-23,3023693,Ken,"We enjoyed staying at Julius's unit.  It's very comfortable and clean, within walking distance of many restaurants, and a convenient location by car.  We'd stay again and enjoyed Seattle!"

794633,15133261,2014-07-03,13321119,Jason,"Great neighborhood - safe, walkable, and right near the amazing Arboretum. Clean and cozy cottage made for an all-around enjoyable stay. And the keyless entry works great."
794633,15185661,2014-07-04,7413893,Jennifer,"My boyfriend and I spent one night at Julius' place. Although we didn't spend any time with Julius face-to-face, he was an extremely helpful and flexible host. I was returning to Seattle from a long international flight and he got the place cleaned and ready for us before the usual check-in time. The place itself is very modern, clean, and exactly as pictured. Although it's part of the property, it feels extremely private and the neighborhood was great! We enjoyed walking around and finding breakfast along Madison Ave. the next morning. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
794633,15419710,2014-07-08,2578842,Lauren,The unit was very cute and clean. We loved the location. It was in a nice area and it has great access to public transportation. Would recommend!
794633,15506614,2014-07-10,9821824,Nissim,"Great place, quiet, clean, peaceful. Perfect for my needs. Julius was very responsive, and helpful. I really enjoyed and felt my space and privacy where respected. Julius even gave me a ride when I checked out, to a nearby location from which I got a cab to the airport. "
794633,15527300,2014-07-11,13864309,Karen,"Julius provided a clean comfortable inviting space for us during our short seattle visit. 
Great economical way to stay in the city. Fantastic walking neighborhood. 
All amenities as promised. 
Very cute space. 
Would definitely stay here again. 

Thanks for a great nigth!!!"
794633,15670819,2014-07-14,13463204,Michael,The host was a good communicator. The listing was what we expected. The neighborhood was great.
794633,15867924,2014-07-17,14946722,Louis Et Christine,"Great place, very clean and confortable! We felt like home! Nice neighborhood with good restaurants. We would definitly come back and would recommand it without any hesitation!"
794633,15946989,2014-07-19,12062722,Michael,"Julius was courteous, warm and welcoming.  He met us and showed us the unit - a very comfortable, immaculate room in a quiet Seattle neighborhood.  It was as described, very comfortable and easy to stay at.  it fit our needs perfectly.  "
794633,16018570,2014-07-20,201210,Karen,"Julius' detached unit was in a great location, very quiet, with a convenient 5 minute walk to one of the best vegetarian brunch spots in Seattle. Parking was a breeze to find and the unit was exactly as pictured (once I realized it was in the back and not in fact, the main house). Very tastefully decorated with right amount of amenities. Would definitely recommend if you're staying in Seattle and looking for a peaceful retreat."
794633,16542716,2014-07-29,12737479,Cassandra,"Our experience with Julius and his space was great! The place came as described and we appreciated Julius' extra touches to make it feel like home. The keyless entry was a smooth process and was beneficial for our arrival time and getting out and about without disturbing anyone else. Very cute home and in an accessible area, close to a lot of interesting places and a neat place to explore. "
794633,16669131,2014-07-31,4394332,Jonathan,"The guest house is just as described and looks identical to the pictures, if not better in person.  Julius was a wonderful host!  Although we didn't formally meet, we did exchange messages.  I loved the keyless entry (Julius provided me with the code) and the location is prime.  We were able to walk to Cafe Flora and explore the many restaurants in the area.  There are hills, but if you power through, you can some gems, Hello Robin .  The detached unit itself is comfy with a wonderful bathroom.  Super clean and comfortable.  The only drawback is the lack of air conditioning as it got rather muggy... we were able to open up the windows, but since the main door doesn't have a screen door, we couldn't open that one which would have helped out a ton.  Other than that, it met our needs.  I would definitely recommend."
794633,16762829,2014-08-02,12930245,Maarten,Julius was responding really quickly and he gave us extra info while we were there. The neighbourhood was about a 20min busride from downtown but it has its own little center of very good restaurants and shops. The room/unit has everything you have at home so more than enough for your holiday!
794633,16835592,2014-08-03,9466322,Shelby,"This unit is beautiful! We arrived late, which makes the keyless entry perfect.  Upon entering the unit, we were blown away with the little details - the place is great! Location is just outside the city, in the cutest neighborhood. We didn't get a chance to meet the host and we wish our stay could have been longer."
794633,16893322,2014-08-04,15417040,Trillian,"The detached unit was modern and clean, and there were plenty of interesting books on the shelves to paw through. Julius made everything very convenient -- we liked the keycode system."
794633,17149857,2014-08-08,6206684,Janek,"
All yes... In a very clean and quiet neighborhood."
794633,17204544,2014-08-09,1730930,Judith,Great location and awesome guest house in Madison Valley.  Well equipped and beautifully appointed; small but adequate.  The bed was comfortable and the host was responsive and very helpful. 
794633,17261508,2014-08-10,12867025,Stuart,"One of the best places, including hotels, you will ever stay in. The Best!! Loved it!"
794633,17509809,2014-08-13,11887384,Monica,We enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Julius was very accommodating and responsive. The place was clean and close to dinning options and Washington Park. We used Uber to get in and out of the city and found it to be convenient and affordable. Capitol Hill is nearby (not walking distance) but a good place for dinner. 
794633,17584405,2014-08-14,19004574,Vincci,"What an awesome stay! Julius gave great directions and instructions to get to the unit. The unit is absolutely 5 star in quality and comfort. It feels like your own little apartment! The private keyless entrance is very convenient. It has everything you need for a comfortable stay in a quiet neighborhood that feels very safe. The free wifi is very useful. There are so many little details that I loved- scented candles, cereal in the cupboard, wine glasses, a first aid kit in the bathroom, 2 types of shampoo and conditioner, a Seattle tourist guide, bus schedules, a fridge and freezer, etc. The bed is not too soft nor too hard. So many options for lighting- there were overhead lights, a reading light, lights in the kitchen, etc. It was tidy and well put together- Julius has great taste in decor and furniture, I must say :) I felt very welcomed and really enjoyed my stay. I would love to stay here again if/when I come back to Seattle!"
794633,17665727,2014-08-15,13532646,Sarah,"Julius has the most perfect, clean, private, modern, and reasonably priced place. He has included all of the little details to make your stay as convenient as possible. Keyless entry makes it easy to arrive and depart anytime. Julius was also very quick to accept out reservation and respond to messages. Great location as well. Highly recommended! "
794633,17707622,2014-08-16,18923383,Jonathan,"We got in late and did not get to meet Julius in person but he was easily accessible via email. The place was as advertised. It is a simple place and a great, comfortable bed. Everything that we needed for the night. The location is perfect and parking was made very simple as we were able to park in front of the house. If we ever get back to Seattle, I would definitely look at this house again."
794633,18227840,2014-08-24,1700322,James (Bill),"I stayed eight days at Julius's in mid-August. Very comfortable, quiet, cozy, clean, modern. Julius is very easy to deal with, available, friendly but not intrusive. Big bed, little kitchenette at one side of the room, a table to sit at at the other, cushy bathroom. Gorgeous neighborhood near transportation. Definitely recommend."
794633,18784492,2014-09-01,14452040,Penny,"Julius was very prompt in replying to our questions, and as this was our first airbnb experience, that was reassuring.  The unit was as described with the additional treat of a few ripe cherry tomatoes growing by the front door.  Clean and tidy, quiet, and with everything you need to settle in or venture out.  We were in Seattle for a family wedding, and it was delightful to have a little nest to come back to after some of the events of the week.  Other than family events we did get in a walk through the Arboretum and down to Madison Park, which was lovely!
"
794633,18934790,2014-09-03,2413205,Laurent,"Perfect place to discover Seattle. A cosy room in a small cottage, abolutely clean, with a large and comy bed, a bathroom and a small kitchenette. We felrt safe in the area. Bus number 11 drives you directly downtown to the Pike Place Market and the bus stop is at less than 5 min. walk from the place.
We saw Julius only when we arrived but he told us to call him at anytime if needed. 
If you visit Seattle, this is the perfect place to stay. "
794633,19064391,2014-09-06,11480214,Mathieu,"Very good place to stay in Seattle, it's very warm a this little apartment feels like home. If i had to return to seattle i will not choose another place."
794633,19510895,2014-09-14,14791495,Michael,"I stayed for 8 nights, visiting Seattle for a conference in Bellevue.  The place was just ideal for me, a very neat self-contained unit with all I needed for a short stay - the unit was clean, tidy and in perfect order.  Julius was very welcoming and responsive to any questions.

The location in Madison Valley was convenient for the scoot across WA520 to Bellevue by car, but also easy to get downtown on the bus.  There are lots of local amenities - coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores - all about 5 mins walk from the unit.

If I'm back in Seattle, I'd stay here again without even thinking twice.
"
794633,19813329,2014-09-19,1722839,John,One of the best airbnb experiences. This place is great is basically all you need to know. Easy parking on the street and access to the bus line. We have used both modes of transportation. Neighborhood is great. Close to downtown and easy to get in and out from other areas of the city. 
794633,19870235,2014-09-20,17256405,Mia,"What a beautiful place! This truly is the reason Airbnb is better than hotels. The unit is stunning, easy to access, and very comfortable. Julius sent me the door code for my stay that day, I had no trouble getting in, and parking was a breeze. Very clean, super luxurious - I cannot wait to come back to Seattle and stay here for longer!"
794633,20132887,2014-09-24,1722839,John,The second part of our eight night stay. We will certainly return. All good things to say about this place. Thank you.
794633,20189077,2014-09-25,6509708,Alex,We had a great experience at Julius's detached unit. Nice neighborhood as well! Would recommend to anyone staying a few days in Seattle.
794633,20411598,2014-09-29,17170720,Robyn,"My father stayed here for 3 nights while visiting me and he had nothing but great things to say. Super clean, beautiful unit and nice, quiet neighborhood. Would love to have family/friends stay here again!"
794633,20642585,2014-10-03,15690288,Kate,Julius was a very friendly host and we loved staying at the detached unit behind his house. Very clean and cosy place.  It was situated close to fun coffee shops and restaurants and we loved walking to the arboretum close by. Awesome spot! 
794633,20714596,2014-10-04,4969845,Tasha,"Julius was great with communication. Once the unit was ready, he sent the access code. The suite was just lovely. Great location! Everything I could have needed was right there, shampoo, hairdryer, etc. The bed is a king which was a nice surprise. I would stay with Julius again in a heartbeat. Thanks again for an awesome stay! "
794633,20851300,2014-10-06,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,"This little cabin/studio is awesome! The decor was modern and comfortable, there was plenty of room, and the bathroom has tons of light. Julius was an incredibly responsive and respectful host and responded immediately when I had a little not-too-important question. The setting is gorgeous and the location is great - less than a 5 minute walk to the Arboretum park and Cafe Flora (I highly recommend this restaurant). If you're up for a little uphill trek, it's only a 30 minute walk to Capital Hill with lots of beautiful scenery in every direction. Parking was ridiculously easy right in front of the house. I would recommend this place to anyone and would love to stay here again! "
794633,20916191,2014-10-07,21135228,Nicole,"Lovely neighborhood with great restaurants nearby. The place was exactly as described and the bed was super comfy! Really loved this location, the neighborhood is really beautiful and safe. So many great things nearby; parks, the lake, gorgeous walking trails, Kurt Cobain's house etc. We loved being away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and when we did head downtown we were only a 10 minute drive away! The bed was REALLY comfy and the neighbors were very quiet and pleasant. We will definitely stay here again :)"

794633,21374710,2014-10-16,12667502,Åse,"I can warmly recommend the little house that Julius rent out! It is very comfortable and the area around is safe, beutiful and perfect for a stay in Seattle! 

I met Julius a few times and my impression is that he is warm, humble and very generous. I had No problem whith anything and if there was any questions or if I needed help I felt secure and comfortable asking Julius!

Feel safe booking this stay in Seattle!

794633,21417280,2014-10-17,1886386,Erin,"Julius was a great host. Very friendly! Allowed us to check in early, place was very clean and comfortable. There were a number of cute restaurants and bars just around the corner. We wish we had a few more nights to stay there and check out the neighborhood! Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
794633,21482736,2014-10-18,15349668,Naomi,"This is a perfect place to stay in Seattle..on a quiet street, tucked back, in walking distance to shops, restaurants and the Japanese Garden in the arboretum. The unit was so clean, spacious, modern, uncluttered, private and relaxing. Julius goes above and beyond to make his guests comfortable and welcome, a truly thoughtful host. "
794633,21578748,2014-10-20,18536975,Cristine,"The owner was attentive, easy to get in touch with, and an excellent communicator. My travel plans changed at the last minute but he made it easy to address the changes, communicated clearly, and I am looking forward to my upcoming stay!"
794633,21690981,2014-10-21,10259056,Robert,"Although my stay was only for a single night and never met Julius in person, he was a fantastic host and communicator. He made it very clear and easy for me to find and access his living space.

We absolutely loved the interior and overall welcoming design of the room. From the book (cool comics and camping/traveling books!) collection, the lighting, and clean bathroom, my g/f and I truly enjoyed our stay. The bed is huge and extremely comfortable! I'd recommend this space and Julius to anyone looking to stay in Seattle wanting a private and quiet place."
794633,21739371,2014-10-23,6793920,Renee,"Perfect place to stay in Seattle! Very clean, great location, and quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend to anyone traveling to SEA!"
794633,21833247,2014-10-25,19685752,Becky,This is a great place to stay in Seattle! Julius made it easy to check in and was available for any questions during our stay. He has a great selection of books about the area and things to do which were really fun to read. The place was perfect too - very simple but had everything we needed. We also loved the location and walked to the arboretum in the morning which was beautiful and very close! I would stay here again when returning to Seattle. 
794633,21952191,2014-10-27,1624726,Minh,"Julius was very nice and accommodating.  He was extremely flexible and allowed us to check in early.  He also helped us find my friend's bracelet and agreed to let us swing by after we had already checked to pick it up. Thank you Julius for being a great host.

The little cabin itself was extremely clean and roomy.  The decor was cute.  I only thing I wish was available, but wasn't, was a tv.  Otherwise, I was very happy with the experience and would stay again if I'm ever in Seattle again.  Plus, there was free internet! And the keyless entry was very convenient and made it easy for us to come and go. Also, I enjoyed listening to the rain overnight.

Overall, it was a great place to stay and I highly recommend it."
794633,22055339,2014-10-28,15054244,Nathan,Everything was as described and very clean and cozy. Our host was very hands off and we certainly never felt intruded upon. I met him briefly and he was a very friendly guy. I highly recommend staying there!
794633,22151317,2014-10-31,22066082,Carole,Julius was accessible and responsive.  Loved the space and it's location - close to great restaurants and the bus line downtown.  I have already recommended it to friends and hope to stay there again!
794633,22200726,2014-11-01,22264572,James,"Julius had the coolest little back unit. We arrived pretty late, and he was very accomodating to make sure we had accurate directions and were able to get in with the keypad lock, which made it a breeze. The room was very clean, and felt more like a hotel room. Plus it was in a nice, quiet neighborhood but still very close to the city. Only down side, we weren't  able to meet him during our stay. Hopefully next time!

We will definitely be staying here again."
794633,22299704,2014-11-03,2151314,Mike,"Exactly what we needed!  We didn't spend much time at the house but it was perfect - quite neighborhood, clean and comfortable living space, comfy bed, easy entry door, and lots of reading material available.  Julius had excellent communication throughout the whole experience.  Thanks Julius!"
794633,22390815,2014-11-04,8030663,James & Elena,"Great place to stay in a beautiful neighbourhood.   Highly recommend and I hope to stay there again the next time I visit Seattle.  Although I didn't meet Julius, he was very quick to respond to any communications through airbnb.  The place is very clean and has everything as described in the listing.  We ate at a couple of the recommended nearby restaurants (Luc and Belle Epicurean) and agree with the host that they're worth a visit -- great French food.  The nearby Arboretum is a beautiful place for a walk.  "
794633,22463706,2014-11-07,4952267,Donald,"After some communications difficulties obtaining the access code for entry (make sure you use airbnb as the communications hub and not the personal email and phone numbers Julius provides) we much enjoyed our stay at the ""cabin."" Perfect location, nicely fitted and furnished and ideal for our visit to Seattle for a literary event. The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the king setup on arrival. The unit is quite compact so note that there are no hanging closets, just drawers. Provision of some toiletries (even unscented shave cream!) and a hair dryer was thoughtful. The unit was clean and except for note 1 (below) well-lighted. Heat control was excellent and ventilation through the sliding windows was fine. Parking on the street, no problem (careful you don't park in the drive and get blocked in by the neighbors' car). Good eateries a couple of blocks away on Madison (especially good breakfast at the bistro on the corner of Madison and E Washington Lake). 
Couple of issues:
1. The bed lamp mounted on the shelf unit upright doesn't have a power switch (that we could find). The light was on when we arrived but to turn it off meant pulling the bed away from the wall far enough to reach behind the headboard and unplug the lamp cord, neither safe nor convenient.
2. While we were grateful for the coffeemaker and just enough grounds for some morning java there were no cups in the cupboard. We enjoyed (slurped) our coffee using the two cereal bowls a la the style of France. 
3. The box of plastic bin liners was empty so we used the bathroom bin (which hadn't been emptied after the previous guests). 
These inconveniences were minor compared to our overall positive experience. It was a typical rainy autumn Seattle day so we didn't get a chance to enjoy the secluded patio in front of the unit...maybe next time. Because of the seclusion by foliage traffic noise was minimal even though busy Madison Ave was only 1+ blocks away. A highly recommended property. "
794633,22673687,2014-11-11,23128400,Janine,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Julius place only for a night but the whole experience was great!! We got to seattle a little bit earlier than we expected and he accommodated our early check in! The space was perfect, very comfy king size bed and it's very cute and cozy! Love how he responds right away with our requests and questions. The keyless door and private entrance was very convenient. Perfect place to stay and lots of walking distance restaurants! Will definitely stay here again!"
794633,22749675,2014-11-13,22600121,Cassie,"I really enjoyed staying in the guest house for 2 nights- it was clean, comfortable, and very private! I slept wonderfully in the large bed. I also enjoyed the quieter neighbourhood as it can be a little hectic downtown. There are some great restaurants nearby. I had breakfast at a beautiful vegetarian spot called Cafe Flora! It was also easy to get downtown on one bus. Thanks for a great stay! :)"
794633,22804317,2014-11-15,23032792,Katie,Great location for the purpose of staying near the U.W.  Very clean and comfortable.

794633,22930446,2014-11-17,3421369,Melissa,"We enjoyed staying here. It was very quiet, comfortable, and convenient to restaurants and downtown. A perfect fit for low key travelers."
794633,22979245,2014-11-19,12104454,Janet,"We had a GREAT time staying in Julius' Private Guest House in Madison Valley!  The location just off Madison Ave. is so convenient to shops, restaurants & the bus to downtown.  The guest house is cute as a button & clean as can be!  The neighborhood is quiet & we felt very safe walking in the evening!  Julius' communications were friendly, prompt & accurate!  We will definitely be repeat customers & have already referred a few friends.  Thanks Julius!! "
794633,23027931,2014-11-20,22332944,Jessica,"Seamless arrangements. Gorgeous and fun little place in a stellar location. Great shower, comfy bed, super clean. We loved it and would visit again. Also, great restaurants within walking distance."

794633,23149183,2014-11-24,15089007,Teresa,"The Guest House was very private and quiet. While we were there, we never saw Julius, but he was only a text away. If we had been there longer, I would have liked to walk through the arboretum, eaten at some of the nearby restaurants, and read a book from the excellent library inside the Guest House. But it was a very convenient location for us as our main destinations were the UW and the Seattle Center."
794633,23315830,2014-11-28,14567242,Victoria,"Loved it. Exactly as described.  Very clean, comfortable, beautiful, full of great books. I didn't meet Julius but everything I needed was provided."
794633,23461193,2014-12-01,12702387,Daniel,"Easy rental.  Accurate photos.  The number combination makes check in / check out a breeze.  Quiet neighborhood but with a cute shopped area about two to three blocks away (although one of the blocks is a flight of stairs).  Solid bakery nearby for breakfast / coffee.  We didn't see much of Julius, but that's not a bad thing, and he was clearly available if we needed something."
794633,23539960,2014-12-03,6978558,Joseph,"Julius has a gem of a place tucked in a great neighborhood. Very cozy and clean and well set up. Fast easy communcation. Complete privacy and lots of street parking and easy access to great walking, bus and food options. Will more then likely have this place in the back of my mind when I'm in a pinch for a place in Seattle again."
794633,23565147,2014-12-04,14129709,Mia,"Julius, Is a great host. He accessible and flexible. The guest house is really a gem of a find on AirBnB. It is in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods with easy access to downtown, the pier and the space needle. "
794633,23675501,2014-12-08,3717885,Diana,"Julius's place is clean, comfortable and private, located in a quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance of several
good restaurants. Communication was easy and welcoming.
"
794633,23816873,2014-12-11,21305273,Nora,"The studio was superb! Lovely, private, very clean and convenient. We spent 3 nights here, the transitions - going in and out is easy and seamless. Julius was very helpful, he  recommended a few good eats nearby, and we love the surroundings - near Washington Park. I'd definitely book this studio again the next time I visit Seattle! "
794633,24180822,2014-12-22,22986754,Chris,Loved the house. It was exactly as described and Julius' communication made the whole process simple

794633,24676274,2015-01-01,2895061,Garrett,"Julius has a wonderfully finished guesthouse in a great location, only a one block walk to the nearest coffee shop. We only stayed a night but if we were there longer there are plenty of cool comics and I could have brushed up on my java stack."
794633,24711256,2015-01-02,7361571,Laura,Julius is a great host! My husband and I went to Seattle for new years it was great staying in a comfortable clean place. We arrived earlier than check in time to drop of our luggage and Julius was very accommodating to our request.   
794633,25195606,2015-01-09,17245343,Brian,"My high-school aged son and I spent a week here in early January. This is a wonderful backyard retreat in the middle of the city. We we easily able to drive into downtown in a few minutes, and even took the bus in a few times, the stop being only two blocks away. Free alley parking is just steps away, too. The unit is quiet, comfortable and cute. Julius was a wonderful host, very quick to communicate with us. We'll definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle!"
794633,25376787,2015-01-13,15941911,Morgan,"Julius has a great place to offer. His guesthouse is very comfortable, stylish, clean, and functional. My friend Grace and I stayed there one night after we ran a half marathon and wished we could have stayed longer. Thanks Julius! "
794633,25446061,2015-01-16,11431389,Dominica,"Julius's guest house was perfect for what I want when I come to Seattle.  Super cute and clean, private, easy parking, easy to find and just a few minute's walk from one of my favorite Seattle restaurants, Cafe Flora!  Thanks so much, I will definitely be staying again. "
794633,25500076,2015-01-18,13145379,Alisha,"What an excellent experience. The house, location and amenities were perfect. Highly recommend staying at Julius' quaint little cottage. "

794633,25893422,2015-01-28,11153208,Nikki,"Julius is an awesome host. Great communication, and he let us check in early :) The little house is adorable! He provides you with everything you would need to feel at home (microwave, fridge, plates+cups, ECT) It's in a very cute neighborhood with cafes, and coffee shops around the corner.  My mom and I stayed there for one night while we explored Seattle, and would have loved to stay longer! Thanks Julius."
794633,25923440,2015-01-30,16575749,Josh,"The detached unit is wonderful and the accommodations the best fit for our stay. Julius was a fantastic host and gave us a warm welcome. We strongly recommend to anyone to stay with Julius and check out the neighborhood, it's love and in a walking distance to restaurants, stores and the Arboretum."

794633,26072225,2015-02-02,11603713,Susan,"Julius was very prompt in responding to my reservation and to every text I sent letting him know of our plans.  The property was quiet and very clean and  in a  convenient location in a good neighborhood.  There are convenience stores, restaurants and access to a major bus line within walking distance.  I especially liked that it was separate from the main house and very private. The entry door had a coded lock, so there was no key to keep track of to get in and out.  My daughter lives within walking distance and we will definitely be using this lovely room again. "
794633,26095725,2015-02-03,23395502,Seira,"We found the guesthouse to be perfect for two of us. It was clean and the bed was huge and comfortable. I enjoyed the privacy of a separate unit and considering our quick stay, we did not even have to interact with Julius - just a keycode was emailed, which was nice as we were there only one night. 
Madison Valley has tons of cute shops and places to eat (even a great park!) making for good walking around, which is always a plus in my book. The place has exactly what we expected and even carried tons of awesome books for us to peruse through. The neighborhood was quiet and there's plenty of street parking.
I would definitely recommend folks to stay here! 
"
794633,26197272,2015-02-06,20828678,Craig,"Great place to stay in Seattle, not far from the city centre and in a nice part of town. 

Suite was nicely decorated and very comfortable, would recommend to anyone!"
794633,26225831,2015-02-07,16348357,Terence,Excellent place! Truly enjoyed my stay. I haven't look around the neighbourhood as we used this location as a resting stop to drive further South. Definitely recommend this place!
794633,26354673,2015-02-10,10865377,Rosalind,Julius was great! He replies quickly and was very accommodating. The place is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I walked inside in awe of the place. It was spacious and felt instantly like home. We were comfortable throughout our whole stay. We liked the place so much we slept in a little longer over the weekend :). We used public transportation and walked around a lot. This place was very close to everything! It was very private and easy to access. We throughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you!
794633,26420922,2015-02-12,2059054,Vena,"Clean and attractive space, sweet neighborhood and responsive hosts. "
794633,26536899,2015-02-15,15685470,Cristina,"We stayed at Julius's home for 3 nights and our experience couldn't be better. The little cabin next to his home is AMAZING. Very clean, spacious, well decorated and with a huge bed, just like in the pictures.
We didn't have the chance to meet Julius in person but the communications with him were fast and effective.
The okace was perfect for us: Privacy, parking in the street without restrictions, close to downtown, very new and clean, and it has everything you may need (iron, hair dryier, kitchen stuff, shampoo, gel and even hair conditioner!)
We will come back!"
794633,26586060,2015-02-16,22542408,Jeff,"Julius was a great host! The place was in great shape, very clean, really great location, had everything we needed! Great communication and offered to provide anything else we needed! I definitely recommend staying here! Thanks again! "
794633,26782729,2015-02-19,8346897,Paul,"Julius was a wonderful host, keeping us updated via text but giving us space during our stay. His place is so charming, clean, and quiet! There are enough books to keep you entertained for weeks! We were able to walk to a delicious vegan Thai restaurant, Araya's, for dinner. Next time it would also be fun to make dinner at the house with the provided hot plate and pans but definitely not needed with so many walkable restaurants. We are also excited to walk to the arboretum during our next stay and explore the Japanese gardens. It's the perfect place for easy access to Seattle events but stands on its own as a lovely vacation spot!"
794633,26904066,2015-02-22,69452,Paula,Everything was great.  Adorable place.  Clean and tidy.  Wonderful location on a quiet street and close to so much.  Easy Lyft ride to everything.  Would recommend.

794633,27250570,2015-03-01,4433773,Siddo,"Julius' guest house in suburban Seattle is incredible! We really enjoyed our stay and it was amazing getting out of the city! The suburb is beautiful with lovely trees and greenery and the shops and restaurants are all within walking distance. As well as this, public transport is very convenient to get to downtown Seattle or connect to the airport train. I definitely recommend this place to everyone, it is truly awesome. Julius was nice enough to let us check in a little bit early because our plane arrived a little bit early! "
794633,27321175,2015-03-02,4607809,Jan,Very peaceful studio close to great Madison Valley restaurants.  I never met Julius but e-communication was easy and prompt.  Great parking on the street out front.

794633,27792605,2015-03-12,25230901,Duncan,"Clean, modern, quiet, private.  Close to restaurants and a fabulous bakery.  Easy to get to downtown Seattle and Seattle Centre.  Great host; great neighbourhood."
794633,27874374,2015-03-14,26324752,Russell,This was an amazing stay for my fiance and I. The guest house is very private and in such a great neighborhood that is right near a park.  We would definately stay here another time!
794633,27990328,2015-03-16,20310017,Tami,"Julius responded to our emails very promptly which made check in super easy. He was very friendly. We never actually met our host, and that was totally ok because everything was taken care of and info such as nearby restaurants was readily available. The location was fantastic - close to great restaurants and bakeries, within walking distance to Washington Park Arboretum, and on a super quiet street with plenty of free parking. We didn't have a need to go downtown, but if we had the house was a 5 minute walk from a bus stop. The Guest House was stocked with everything we needed including an iron and a blow dryer. The king sized bed was very comfy, and there wasn't anything we lacked. Btw, take note there is no tv, which was a plus in my book. We chose to eat out every meal, but there was a good size mini fridge, microwave and hot plate which would have made putting together a small meal pretty easy. Overall, I would recommend the Guest House for a stay in Seattle, and I will be booking a stay for my next trip soon."
794633,28379915,2015-03-23,24375362,Kip,"We really liked Julius's guest house. It is separate from the main house in a tranquil backyard, has all the amenities that we needed, and is nicely decorated. Parking is easy, and the neighborhood is quiet and offers nice eateries and places to enjoy being outside (especially the Washington Park Arboretum).

Julius himself is communicative and clear. Any questions that arose he had answers for right away. I would definitely stay at Julius's guest house again!"
794633,28490760,2015-03-24,10551633,Nathan,"Julius was super accommodating, allowing us to drop our things off prior to check-in. He also gave us great recommendations on food, drink, and popular tourist attractions. The location and guest house was beautiful and would highly recommend this spot while in Seattle."
794633,28649093,2015-03-28,26447802,Siyi,"Julius's place is perfect! Very clean and pretty. The neighborhood is super beautiful. We took bus, uber and lyft around, still very convenient. The king bed is big enough for three girls of us. Our stay in Seattle is wonderful! "
794633,29040798,2015-04-03,6034075,Thomas,"We had an awesome time in Seattle! Julius and the guest house in Madison valley was the perfect fit for our vacation. Close to the city walking distance to great food and coffee! Highly recommend this location. The guest house is perfectly equipped, very quiet, and really comfortable little home away from home."
794633,29100331,2015-04-04,26715350,Sandra,"Recently stayed in this cute little house in Seattle with Julius. It was great, the place was up to the description and the area it is located in is very convenient if you want to go down to the Space needle. Although i did not have the chance to meet Julius, the communication via email was great. Totally recommend this place, you will love it! Thank you Julius. "
794633,29255809,2015-04-06,25572797,Andreas,"Ett fräscht och funktionellt boende i kanontrevlig villaförort nära kvarterskrogar, bageri och parker. Lätt att parkera, nära busshållplats och cirka en halvtimmes promenad till Capitol Hill. Julius är trevlig, hjälpsam och återkopplar snabbt. Återvänder gärna!"
794633,29486826,2015-04-08,3055919,Bryan,"Beautiful place in a fun neighborhood with great stuff in the area and easy to get to from wherever in the city. The king sized bed is great and the whole place is comfortable. The shower also has great pressure, which is appreciated."
794633,29962473,2015-04-15,11017814,Alex,Fantastic place to stay in Seattle! A very cozy guest house in a great location. It was close to downtown so it made it very easy for us to get around while we were visiting. Julius was a great host and kept us updated on anything in regards to our reservation. We will definitely be returning!
794633,30106619,2015-04-17,7056782,Sean,"This guest house was just what I needed. Julius made everything convenient and I was in and out without any issues. The area is set back in a quiet neighborhood, but very close to Madison Valley main strip. Recommended!"
794633,30185242,2015-04-19,14843765,Lauri,"We had a great start of our holiday at Julius'place! We arrived on our own time: he had set a entrance code for us, so it was very convenient not to hurry or delay ourselves to check in. 

The guest house is perfect: a comfortable bed, a simple but useful kitchen (which we didn't use) and clean bathroom. Outside a nice looking garden with a lot of sunshine. You can easily park your car in front of the house. Close by you find shops, cafes, diners, and the lovely Japanse Garden (entrance of 10 dollars is worth it). Also a bus stop is within a 5min walk, for a quick connection downtown. 

Julius is the most friendly guy, and available when needed. Thanks so much for your hospitality! "
794633,30466735,2015-04-22,473451,Jenn,Nice! The guest house had everything I needed. Easy in and out. The area is beautiful! Plenty of restaurant choices. Near the highway. 
794633,30757388,2015-04-27,4251893,Tom,"Muito boa experiência em Seattle. É como um chalé no quintal da casa do Julius, que fica num bairro residencial bem tranquilo e seguro, onde é fácil chegar, sair e estacionar. Embora não esteja perto do centro e outros pontos turísticos mais célebres da cidade, fica muito perto do imperdível Arboretum e dos bares e restaurantes da Madison St.
Já o chalé é pequeno e muito funcional para um casal, que era o nosso caso: tem um bom banheiro, uma falsa cozinha com frigobar, cafeteira, pia e chapa para panelas. O melhor de tudo era a cama: grande e confortável. Boa para relaxar.
No final da estadia eu esqueci objetos pessoais no chalé e precisei voltar. O Julius nos atendeu prontamente e embora não o tenhamos conhecido, a comunicação virtual foi sempre fluida e amigável. Também aceitou de maneira muito gentil as nossas sugestões. Recomendado, tanto o anfitrião como o local!"
794633,30861224,2015-04-28,3395405,Nicole,"Great location, close to downtown. Very nice peaceful neighborhood. The space is private, clean and very comfortable. Convenient and safe for car parking. We would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle! "
794633,31114479,2015-05-02,28887170,Setareh,"We had a great experience at Julius' guest house in Madison Valley. Though we were only there a couple of nights, the guest house was cute and very clean. The neighborhood was nice, quiet, and felt safe. We would definitely stay here again :)"
794633,31223816,2015-05-03,242707,Teresa,"Our stay in Seattle was perfect. Julius' guest house was comfortable, private, and clean. He was happy to answer all of our questions beforehand via email, and even gave up some tips on where to go and what to see. We would definitely stay here again! "
794633,31584401,2015-05-07,30074203,Sarah,"This was a great stay for my first trip to Seattle! It was a perfect size for two, clean, comfortable, and close to everything. I loved the additional parking in the back too. I only wish I had the ability to stay longer!"
794633,31890597,2015-05-11,846157,Paula,"Love this place. Clean, quiet, easy parking, safe neighborhood, great yard. This place makes me wish I still lived in Seattle. My partner and I stayed with our little dogs and it was the best place for all of us. My only regret in writing this review is that it might be booked when I return next time. We would stay every time."
794633,33348587,2015-05-27,23560527,Rhonda,"The description was exactly what I expected. Very clean, quiet, and a very comfortable bed. Modern and decorated nicely. The location was good for us, near where my daughter and family live. Close to and in walking distance to good restaurants. Near the Arboretum for walking or cycling. "
794633,33473282,2015-05-28,18193928,Kathy,Great and quiet little neighborhood with ample street parking and close to everything.  The guesthouse was clean and nicely decorated. J was in touch but also gave us privacy. Cute little place!
794633,33564029,2015-05-30,25863699,Yurim,"This was a great place, perfect clean!
Julius was quick to reply in setting up the reservation. 
I will be staying here again next time we visit! Perfect!!!
Thank you Julius :)"
794633,33900881,2015-06-02,28070639,Rachel,"Our stay in Julius' guest house truly exceeded our expectations. Julius was an excellent host - he is super nice and welcoming, and we enjoyed talking with him about gardening (his backyard is beautiful!). He was also flexible with the arrival time, allowing us to check-in a couple hours early. We absolutely loved the location - the neighborhood had the cutest houses, we were walking distance to cute shops and restaurants (Cafe Flora!), and also a short drive to downtown. Parking was really easy. The guest house was clean, comfortable, modern, and had everything we needed. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Seattle! "
794633,34187446,2015-06-06,18768340,Chris,Great place in a great location! The room was clean and quiet. J was a great host. 
794633,34301527,2015-06-07,1526263,Julia,"The room is just as pictured and even felt nicer. Everything was very clean and up to my very high standards.  I felt incredibly comfortable.  We could not have wished for a nicer, better place to stay in Seattle.  Our host was able to get the room ready a little early for us which while not expected was a bonus.  The neighborhood felt very safe and is a very cute area.  I wish we had more time to explore but we found some wonderful bakeries and shops.   I really can't say enough about how great the room was and it felt very private and secure. I highly recommend this Guest House for anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle.  "
794633,34693967,2015-06-11,28161935,Grace,The bed and fan made the room very comfortable.  Mr. Schorzman e-mailed us encouraging to contact him with any questions.  The books in the quest house are fun and helpful.   the door code worked flawlessly and the decorating was great 
794633,34909107,2015-06-13,35118281,Kanda,This place was very pleasant and clean. I really enjoyed my stay here. Very restful and quiet!
794633,35194084,2015-06-16,23166319,ELiza,"This is why we love AirB&B. This was a great, quiet back yard haven in a wonderful residential neighborhood. It was clean, comfortable and attractive. It was neither fancy nor expensive which was just perfect. This is a really nice location in Seattle, near the Arboretum but with good bus service as well as cafes just ""up the stairs"" on Madison.  We did not get to meet Julius, but we got all the information we needed by email and/or text when we needed it. "
794633,35398787,2015-06-18,25561890,Marigelle,"Julius was very responsive and hospitable. His place was comfortable, super clean and adorable! I loved how you can open all the curtains and let a lot of the sunlight in. Everything you needed was provided, including a ton of reading material. You could spend an entire day just enjoying the quietness and getting lost into one of his books.  Parking was easy and convenient and his place is located in a great area. "
794633,35631747,2015-06-21,4549429,Charles,Description of unit was very accurate. We did not meet Host but he replied to our arrival requests in a timely manner.
794633,35917168,2015-06-23,2190354,Randall,The guest house really met our expectations. Clean and quiet. Madison Valley is a great Seattle location. Julius was a perfect host.
794633,36044638,2015-06-24,5258169,Siyi,"The place was clean and tidy, and conditions were exactly as seen in pictures. I was in Seattle for a short trip, so I just needed a place to sleep over, and J's place fulfilled that need. The bathtub has good water pressure and working hot water. It's also clean with good lighting. Overall, it was a pleasant stay at J's place. Would recommend to anyone dropping by Seattle."
794633,36928743,2015-07-02,19068665,Meera,"The place was beautiful, as described in the listing. It was extremely clean, well organized and maintained. The owner had arranged for everything that you might need for a stay, which completely gives a home like feeling. The room was meticulously decorated far better than a hotel room. The room has a separate entrance, giving you the freedom to get in without disturbing anybody. There was ample parking space available across the house.
I would be more than happy to recommend this place to my friends visiting Seattle.

Cheers!
Meera"
794633,37447279,2015-07-07,4366296,Diane,"This place was clean, quiet and private. Location was perfect for our needs as we were visiting our son who lives in Madison Valley.  Julius was very responsive to our request particulary as it became very hot and he quickly provided an extra fan and installed blinds to keep the place cool.  Highly recommend staying in this area as it offers nice restaurants an easy access to bus for going to downtown Seattle.  Thank you Julius."
794633,37627638,2015-07-08,37608812,Akasha,This was a perfect little hide away. The guest house was just like the pictures showed. The house was with in walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants. I would defiantly stay here again.
794633,37805258,2015-07-10,36130828,Zhuo,房东很用心!房子非常好，完全符合照片，很惊喜!所在街区非常安静，院子里的草地很适合晒太阳。屋子打扫的非常干净，有可以烧开水的壶，洗手间很好。离房子不算远就有madison park湖滨公园很适合散步和游泳。
794633,38091852,2015-07-13,4549429,Charles,Julius greeted us and made us feel quite welcome
794633,38352009,2015-07-14,7268009,Hollis,"This space was ideal for our trip = fantastic location near all the cute restaurants and shops in Madison Valley and extremely convenient for me because I have family in Leschi, Madrona, Seward Park...really great space separate from house with kitchen and roomy bathroom - light and airy. Wish we could have stayed longer than 1 night - may stay for the holidays instead of with family!  "
794633,38554490,2015-07-16,7937657,Shixuan,"It's an wonderful experience, we arrived pretty late the day we moved in, but the house is pretty easy to access. And I like the code entry, it gives you the privacy you want. The entire house is pretty updated and has a cozy feeling to it. Overall an great experience, nice to talk to J and hope you guys enjoy it here. Love Seattle!"
794633,38657731,2015-07-17,37918513,Carrie,Great place to stay! The guest house was clean and comfortable. Location was perfect - within walking distance to stores and wonderful restaurants. The host had great communication also! Will be staying here again.
794633,38763932,2015-07-18,33467774,Julia,"This was a perfect stay for us. Very comfortable and clean and well decorated. It was completely private, which was important for us. J provided us with the door code on the day of our arrival so there wasn't any further check in coordination needed! Parking and location were very convenient. We found a spot right across the street from the house with no problems. The house is close by a few good restaurants and cafes. I would highly recommend this listing! We were very happy with it :) "
794633,39156770,2015-07-21,407163,Carroll,"The home was exactly as pictured and our host graciously greeted us upon arrival.  For us, the location was perfect.  We have family that live only minutes away.  Hope to stay with J again. "

794633,39491977,2015-07-24,32763696,Christine,Very charming cottage in heart of Madison valley!  Will be back for sure!
794633,39903697,2015-07-27,13711631,Jamie,Great experience! Easy check-in since Julius sends a key code -- no coordinating keys. The space is very clean and there is ample room to put personal items. Parking on the street is no problem. Great area -- super close to large park with lots of walking/running trails. Would definitely stay here again!
794633,40267695,2015-07-29,3829144,Laurie,"Great communication and it was so easy to get into the unit with the door code.  It is located in a great neighborhood and the unit is exactly as described.  There are a bunch of interesting books to read, and the sheets are incredibly soft!  We would definitely stay here again!"

794633,41483649,2015-08-07,11379159,Matt,"J had great communication and responded to questions very quickly. Although we weren't able to meet in person he made sure I had everything I needed during my stay. 

His guest house is the perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle. It was incredibly clean, was well appointed, and the bed was comfortable. 

Great experience, highly recommended!"
794633,41677513,2015-08-08,26129318,Matt,"J's place in Seattle was cute and comfortable, as described in the listing. J had the place clean and ready before our check in and was very respectful of our privacy during our stay so overall thumbs up for J."
794633,42111462,2015-08-11,3169699,Lauren,"J was an awesome host and very welcoming!  Upon arriving to Seattle, he messaged me to let me know that he’d try his best to accommodate an early check in since my flight was early in the morning.  He even offered to let me drop off my things while he cleaned the listing.  When I finally checked in, the guesthouse was spotless and looked exactly like it did in the photos.  The neighborhood was charming and quiet.  My boyfriend and I rented a car for the weekend and parking was never an issue for us.  The listing was close to everything and very easy to get to.  I highly recommend this listing and would gladly stay here again."
794633,42472975,2015-08-13,40551452,Justin,"Very much enjoyed staying here. Great location - close to places of interest while staying in a quiet neighborhood. Everything was exactly as described, very easy and no hassles. Would recommend. "

794633,42924294,2015-08-16,2950578,Adam,"Awesome private room in a great neighborhood. We didn't meet J as our stay was short, but he was quick to respond to messages and kept himself for any needs. "
794633,43532941,2015-08-20,25411770,Leah,"Great time staying here while visiting Seattle! Keep in mind there is no tv or air conditioning, but J has a fan to help circulate the air. Highly recommended!"
794633,44101442,2015-08-24,1565633,Peter,Exactly as explained and advertised. Checkin/Checkout were seamless. We only had 2 days in Seattle so having a checkin/checkout experience that required no coordination with the host was especially nice. It was a perfect stepping off point for the city. 
794633,44412957,2015-08-26,4763914,Robert,Good location on very quiet street. Listing was accurate and J's communications timely. Great bed. Parking on street no problem and neighborhood felt very safe - we left our road bikes locked on car overnight with no qualms.
794633,44791010,2015-08-29,18141801,Swaminathan,"My wife and I were arriving late but that was no trouble as J gave us all the information to let ourselves in to the Guest House behind his home.  We found the property exactly as described: Clean, with comfortable furnishings and an excellent shower.  We also enjoyed browsing through the various interesting books that J has on his bookshelves.  Since the Guest House is completely separate from the main house, and since the neighborhood is quiet, we slept soundly each night.  

Cafe Flora was a nice spot for breakfast and that is just two blocks away. I would recommend this for any couple looking for a quiet comfortable place to stay in the Capitol Hill area."
794633,44963401,2015-08-30,38467011,Matthew,"I've got nothing to add to the previous five-star reviews, they're entirely earned.  :)"
794633,45376953,2015-09-02,35515522,Kristen,Listing description matched what we found in this cute little guest house! It was perfect for our short stay and we had just what we needed in a great location.
794633,45653885,2015-09-05,31788333,Carianne,Great experience! Loved Seattle and our cozy guest house. Everything was just as pictured.

794633,45806595,2015-09-06,36994340,Andrew,"Out of 5 different AirBNB places my fiance and I stayed on our Pacific Northwest trip, J's was by far one of our favorites!  His guest house behind his home is VERY spacious inside, and is very cute!  The best was extremely spacious, and all of his amenities including coffee, a hair drier in the bathroom, fresh towels, and plenty of reading material was great.  He lives in a very quiet and safe neighborhood, close to nearly anything in Seattle you'd like to do, with plenty of street parking.  There is a small back entrance so you don't have to walk through his driveway, which we liked because we didn't feel like we were intruding on his private home.  Again, we can't say enough about this place!"
794633,46112567,2015-09-08,10733376,Patrick,Julius' guest house was perfect! Great location to Capitol Hill bars and restaurants for our Seattle stay.
794633,46385137,2015-09-10,32522387,Jill,The stay was very quiet and private. The room was well appointed but would benefit from a trash can in the bathroom. 
794633,47238973,2015-09-17,25199861,Michelle,"It is always a great feeling when someone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. This is just what our host did. We were arriving early in the day and Julius made sure all was ready early even though another guest had just left that morning. The property was just as describe, very comfortable and clean. The security lock feature made it so easy to get access and when we departed, no keys to exchange. The location was perfect, downtown Seattle was only a short drive. I recommend taking advantage of the neighborhood restaurants and shops, only a 2 block walk. Great stay, Great host.  Thanks "
794633,47529798,2015-09-20,22244316,Jennifer,"J's place was amazing! Just like the description, the place is spacious w a king bed, a table for dining for 2. The bathroom is full sized with full tub. The place was spotless. It was easy to find and close to the freeway which was great for us as we were going to Portland the next day. We will definitely come back to J's place again. "
794633,47626442,2015-09-21,18536975,Cristine,"The space was exactly as decribed; light, private, central, and smartly appointed. It was clean and convenient, cozy and quiet even though it's right in the heart of the Madison Valley; perfect walking distance to countless great eateries, parks, and shops. The host was respectful of my privacy while still being accomodating and available. Highly recommend this adorable and comfortable house!"
794633,48090611,2015-09-23,14894976,Christine,"We had a very good experience at J's Guest House in Madison Valley.  It is private, comfortable and spacious.  Lots of amenities for a short stay including the kitchenette and frig.  It was easy to find and access, adequate parking and J was a great host.  Super location.
We definitely plan to use the Guest House again, when we are in the Seattle area."
794633,48224445,2015-09-24,42160183,Paul,"Exactly or better than the listing conveyed.  Clean, tidy and quaint.  "
794633,48937649,2015-09-29,9997000,Natalie & Stephen,"The guest house in Madison Valley was a perfect, tranquil spot to stay for our last night before departing Seattle!  It's in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, but within just a short couple blocks of some exceptional dining options. Parking behind the guest house is easy, and the walk into the yard is serene and peaceful. The guest house itself is furnished in a very modern and hip style, with everything you need and nothing you don't. It was cozy, comfortable, and IMMACULATELY clean. WiFi worked flawlessly, check-in was easy, and there is even a great selection of books if you feel like heading to one of the nearby parks for a little reading. I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay outside of the city center in one of the nicest parts of Seattle. "
