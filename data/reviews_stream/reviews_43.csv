2481869,40354039,2015-07-30,37320552,Sara,We had a very enjoyable stay at this little cottage in Queen Anne. The home easily accommodated our family of four and the great location allowed us to take advantage of everything Seattle has to offer. We especially enjoyed being able to walk to the parks and the great cafes in the neighborhood. I highly recommend Andrea's place!
2481869,41730568,2015-08-09,13973370,Ryan,"Andrea was an excellent host. Her place is a very clean quite cottage within a great area, located nearby beautiful homes and views of the city. The neighborhood feels like a small town hidden away from the city and staying here will give you a sense of what it feels like to live in Seattle. She also provided great suggestions for me to explore."
2481869,42244807,2015-08-12,4515283,Christine,"We (a couple with 12yr-old daughter) spend 3 days in Andrea's cottage and really enjoyed the stay. 
First of all, Queen Anne is an extremely nice neighbourhood. The cottage is in a residential neighbourhood, but a big supermarket and a great little bakery / cafe are in walking distance. 
The cottage is quiet, light and airy and super well equipped, even for a longer stay. Everything seemed new and clean.
Andrea was a perfect host, always approachable and happy to help, starting with a perfect welcome package (we could've left our travel guide at home :-)).
Thanks for a lovely stay, we'll be back!"
2481869,43071991,2015-08-17,37375301,Wesley,"Wow. I cannot begin to describe how awesome this place is. Such a great neighborhood, and amazingly quiet location. Yet, being in a comfortable, quiet neighborhood there are so many great, walk-able locations within the neighborhood. Cafes, groceries, salons, and store-fronts galore!

The apartment is set up so nicely, and totally fit our lifestyle; clean, simple and modern.

Andrea is very responsive and really cares about your stay and was very accommodating. This really made our trip seamless and comfortable. : ) "
2481869,43935013,2015-08-23,36083065,Caleb,"Amazing Cottage in an awesome neighborhood. When staying here we were within walking distance of great coffee shops, amazing bakeries, and an Ice Cream Shop (Molly Moos) that we loved. Andrea was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction for local groceries and restaurants. Upon arrival the cottage was exactly as she said it would be Clean, Bright, and Airy!!"
2481869,44644989,2015-08-28,11450211,Ronee,"What a great place to stay. Extremely comfortable for 4 people. Modern, very clean and quite large. The neighborhood is great with caf√©s and a farmers market in walking distance and an easy bus ride downtown. "
2481869,45069486,2015-08-31,15542700,Mary,"Andrea's cottage was a great space, extremely clean and well thought out.  Andrea was very attentive with emails/texts asking how we were.  The apartment is in a very walkable area and we would definitely stay again!"
2481869,45566458,2015-09-04,31085765,Margaret,"Wonderful! Great location - gorgeous , quiet neighborhood, easy parking. Apartment was spotless , light , and had everything we needed."
2481869,45921627,2015-09-07,28657578,Curt,"Great place for just the two of us. It had everything we needed and more. It's also a in a fantastic location, with plenty of food/drink options."
2481869,47040797,2015-09-15,36567955,Stacey,"My friend and I had a great stay. The apartment is in a lovely part of Queen Anne, just around the corner from numerous amenities. You really can't ask for a better location. Andrea and Greg were readily accessible to help with any needs we may have had, and we felt incredibly at home while staying in their unit.

Can't recommend them enough!"
2481869,48850598,2015-09-28,34705237,Geno,This was my first airbnb experience after I was cancelled on by a previous host. The apt was very nice and clean! The neighborhood is nice and quiet and there is an awesome coffee shop & bakery within walking distance. Andrea was very quick to respond and made this process really easy! I would stay again anytime
2481869,50370810,2015-10-11,4037676,Josh,"The space was perfect for me, my wife and 2 year old toddler for the weekend. Comfy furnishings and nice, usable kitchen. The location is extremely quiet and peaceful. Andrea's communication was very thorough and thoughtful. From booking to check-in to check out, the whole process was very smooth and easy. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a quaint, 1 bedroom cottage-like stay on Queen Anne."
3819831,18959497,2014-09-03,1268306,Albert,Philip was easy to reach over email and made sure we were ready before we arrived in Seattle and during our stay. The apartment complex was quiet as advertised and was only a short walk away from bus stops and Safeway.
3819831,19492006,2014-09-13,7853903,Leon,"All good. Easy communication with Philip and Genevieve, clean apartment with everything you need. "
3819831,47214619,2015-09-16,2771019,Juan,The place is as advertised. Lovely apartment on a beautiful neighborhood. 
3819831,56569623,2015-12-14,25540862,Paul,"Great stay, was very happy with it! Just as shown in the photos. Really nice quiet area but quick walk to great restaurants, bars, and so forth.  The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and everything working well. Would recommend to anyone interested."
3819831,56738216,2015-12-17,3953998,Francisco,"Listing was every accurate. Very simple, clean, economical accommodation in a GREAT location. Parking can be a pain, so if you have a vehicle be ready to park a block or two away. Not a huge deal. "
873073,28895675,2015-03-31,2529585,Luke,"Great location, lots of space, nice kitchen. The house has some quirks (e.g. you have to go outside and into the basement to use the washer/dryer) but is fun. The hosts were especially welcoming, providing detailed instructions including great restaurant recommendations."
873073,29320749,2015-04-06,7940996,Dirk,"Lovely place, Hernan was very helpful and i would strongly recommend his place on your next visit to Seattle!

"
873073,29841961,2015-04-13,28821155,Chelsea,"The listing description was accurate.  Both the home and the neighborhood were absolutely beautiful. They made us feel welcome by preparing the bedrooms for us with made up beds and towels. They also left a detailed list of anything and everything we would need to know about the home concerning temperature, laundry, internet, etc. and even nearby amenities. The home was very clean and well kept."
873073,30329255,2015-04-20,13646102,Ellen,"I stayed at Hernan's home when I went to visit my daughter last weekend, she is a student at UW.  She stayed with me and we both loved this house.  The garden is magical and the view of Seattle from the bedroom upstairs is wonderful.  The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed breakfast on the back deck.  After being out and about all day we came back every evening to relax and watch a movie.  Irwins, the coffee shop a block away is a real treasure, a friendly neighborhood place.  I look forward to staying here again. "
9522082,58438668,2016-01-02,43645709,Fernando,"We had a wonderful experience at this property and will be sure to look for it again should we visit Seattle in the future.  We were thrilled to be the first to rent it and the owners really nailed it in terms of setting us up for success.

Denise was great to work with, super responsive and ready to help even before we arrived with tips about the area and things to do for our entire family.

The home is fantastic (we may be slightly biased as we live in a Victorian home ourselves - coincidentally built the same year as this property).  It is tastefully remodeled yet keeps all the charm and character of its era. It is extremely clean, comfortable (perfect for our family of four), cozy, well updated and best of all in an AMAZING location, walking distance from many attractions, restaurants, supermarkets and shops."
3768745,35742032,2015-06-21,35917988,Marc,"I couldn't have had a better experience...  Andrew's place is pristine.  He made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, wasn't hovering, and made us feel completely at home.  $6 cab to downtown core.  For the first time I've tried airbnb, I have only positive comments.  I could go on and on, but to be simple, the suite is beautiful, Andrew was a pleasure to meet, his dog is excellent, and we had a perfect time.  I would, and will hopefully stay here again anytime I'm in Seattle."
3768745,36143189,2015-06-25,7011087,Vanessa,"Andrew was a great host. He was flexible with our arrival time and even carried our luggage into the house and downstairs. We were welcomed with a warm note & chocolates on the bed, fresh flowers, snacks, and a basket of toiletry samples in the bathroom. We needed to use the couch for sleeping, and Andrew left extra linens out for us. The space is beautiful and welcoming. The backyard is tranquil and peaceful. We will definitely be staying with Andrew again. It was my mom's first Air BnB experience, and she was impressed by the experience and will stay with Andrew the next time she's in Seattle visiting my sister. If you enjoy staying in luxury and comfort, you will enjoy Andrew's Air BnB."
3768745,36902053,2015-07-02,34701124,Brittany,"If you can believe it, this place is even better than described! The suite is very private, clean and comfortable.  Additionally, the location was ideal for us - 15 minute walk to the Space Needle and EMP Museum; 30 minute walk to Pike Place Market; 3 minute walk to Lake Union. It was really easy to get to and from. 

Perhaps the best feature however, is Andrew. He was so thoughtful and accommodating. He was not able to meet us when we arrived, but left us a welcome note (along with all of the lovely goodies he describes above) and made sure that we were comfortable. He was able to provide amble suggestions for places to eat, things to do and how to get there. Andrew seemed truly interested in ensuring that we have a wonderful stay. "
3768745,37367976,2015-07-06,19813799,Jen,"Andrew was such a wonderful host! He was very flexible about the time we got in, which is great as traffic between Portland and Seattle can be unpredictable. The house and neighborhood were GORGEOUS. The room was large  and beautifully decorated with a nice queen sized bed, large tv, awesome bathroom, and great little office room. It was very warm the weekend we were up, but the basement room stayed cool with the aid of a fan. Overall wonderful experience."
3768745,37697737,2015-07-09,36990462,Pam,"Thank you so much Andrew, we had a wonderful time while in Seattle and staying at your house was a delight. Your beautiful house, garden, and all of your thoughtful extra touches made for a great stay. Andrew is a great host, he answered our numerous questions, gave suggestions for places to eat and visit and how to use Seattle's transportation options. But best of all he was a gracious host, even though we were in his home he never made us feel like we were imposing. "
3768745,38776522,2015-07-18,37945725,Annie,"You should stay here! Andrew's place is absolutely beautiful, in a great location, with exceptional hospitality. Very highly recommended."
3768745,39786715,2015-07-26,11296859,Michael,"Andrew is an exceptional host, and his home (including the rental space) is truly lovely. Even though we arrived nearly an hour early, Andrew was extremely welcoming and friendly. The room is spacious, clean, and bright, and when we arrived it was packed with lots of extra amenities (snacks, water, coffee, toiletries, etc.). Andrew even gave us some extra snacks and treats for the road! The house is in a great location, easy to get downtown and only a 15-minute walk to the major attractions (Space Needle, EMP, etc.); plus he gave us lots of excellent recommendations for places to eat and drink in the area. Overall we could not have been more pleased and we highly recommend Andrew as a host!

Thank you, Andrew, for helping to make our first visit to Seattle so pleasant. We will be back!
"
3768745,41396116,2015-08-07,36908355,Sheila,"Bill and I loved staying at the Downtown Queen Anne large suite. It was home away from home. It was comforting to know that the private entrance to the suite was safe. The backyard was an inviting oasis from the busy city with its pond, lights, tall trees and the birds singing, very romantic. The edible gifts at our door were rejuvenating at the end of a busy day. We enjoyed them as we relaxed on the sofa while watching TV on the big screen. The bed was very comfortable. Andrew was an excellent host. We would highly recommend his suite."
3768745,41961468,2015-08-10,34332363,Weichuan,"The room is really decent, and completely separate from the other part of the house. It has everything we need, Andrew even prepared free water and snacks for us. The yard is amazing, especially in the night! We will definitely book it again, if we come to Seattle again.  "
3768745,44923620,2015-08-30,36211329,Becky,Andrew is an excellent host. His place is very comfortable and clean and very nicely decorated. We will be back again I am sure.
3768745,45453326,2015-09-02,8268733,Alex,"Andrew was very accommodating and thoughtful in making us feel comfortable during our stay. The space is very cozy and we loved the private entrance where you enter through the side fence door and have access to the back garden space. In addition, we were able to walk downtown easily and there's also a bus stop two blocks away. There were also a wide variety of snacks, beverages, and toiletries available that usually I would drool over and not pay extra for in a hotel, but I was happy to indulge since they were provided, especially the homemade granola next to the coffee machine. On a personal note, he was very flexible and communicative when we had to depart early due to a family emergency."
3768745,47639082,2015-09-21,35999710,Barb,We really enjoyed staying with Andrew.  He is a kind and accommodating  host and is knowledgeable about the area.  You're only a short walk away from public transit and walking distance to a lovely restaurant/shopping area.  We would stay there again in a heart beat.
3768745,48831720,2015-09-28,4720344,Ian,"This was one of the best air bnb's we've stayed in- the room was perfect and Andrew was a kind and friendly host. The room is separate from the main house, with private entrance and was full of nice touches- from homemade granola to the great travel book collection and classical music playing through built in speakers. Location was great- we were able to walk to the space needle and pikes place and into Queen Anne for dinner in the evening. Thanks Andrew, we wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Seattle!"
3768745,51412574,2015-10-19,30493006,Mary,"On previous trips to Seattle I have stayed in the usual run of hotels. Staying with Andrew made me feel that I was at home and a part of Seattle and not just a traveler passing through. The suite is lovely, the garden is beautiful and tranquil, the bed is gloriously comfortable and the home made granola bars are to die for. I would certainly stay again. "
3768745,52697058,2015-11-01,169915,Mary,Andrew was waiting for us when we arrived. He showed us the suite and answered our questions.
7914021,47806196,2015-09-21,10350617,Josh,"Noah's place was awesome! Great comfy bed, awesome views, and great location. Plenty of stuff within walking distance.

Thanks Noah!"
7914021,48580066,2015-09-27,2974510,Cassy,"Noah's house was so wonderful and so cozy! My fiancee and I loved staying there, and plan on staying there in the future when we visit Seattle. Being in the creative/artist world ourselves, we felt it had all the perfect touches, being unique, but also feeling so at home. The neighborhood was quiet, and you can see the lake from living room windows, what a view! Noah was so quick in responses and so incredibly considerate and helpful. "
7914021,49836238,2015-10-06,7727978,Alexandra,"Noah‚Äôs place was great! The house was very cozy and decorated with great care.  There was a nice view of the lake, which is just a short walk away.   Noah was also very quick to respond and very accommodating.  Highly recommend!  "
7914021,50589465,2015-10-12,44110991,Haley,"Noah's place is really nicely decorated and is in a very quiet, safe little neighborhood. Had a great stay. Comfy bed. "
7500000,42976435,2015-08-16,975782,Justin,"We loved our stay at Mandy's town home! We were surprised to see that her place is even nicer in person than it is in the photos. 

Mandy is really responsive and was flexible on our check in/out times. The whole process was hassle-free.

Couldn't ask for more! Much appreciated."
7500000,44021861,2015-08-23,7815980,Melanie,"We enjoyed our stay at Mandy's house  and definitely recommend it to visit Seattle! 

We didn't meet Mandy though everything was perfectly arranged, she emailed all the information before arrival, the key was available in a box, and she left us a sheet of paper with all the indication. We felt like at home, finding easily all that we needed, including breakfast with fresh bagels that Mandy had prepared for us!

The house is located south of Seattle and it worked out well to visit the city. We took bus 120 that goes directly to downtown (it takes only 20min) and from the airport we took a Lyft, the ride was $26. 

The house itself was great, like on the pictures, very clean and comfortable for 4 people, Mandy even prepared an extra air mattress for us!"
7500000,44972102,2015-08-30,32541006,Jolene,"Mandy was a great hostess! She responded to all my inquiries immediately. I took my fianc√© to Seattle for his birthday weekend getaway, and Mandy welcomed us with a piece of chocolate cake. She also welcomed us to eat whatever she had in the fridge, but we had already bought groceries when we arrived. She also gave us many great suggestions on what to check out and provided a lot of tourist pamphlets for us look at. 

Her home was so clean, cute and cozy, with lots of windows for natural light. It was also very easy to get to. It was only 15 min to drive to downtown. It was raining this past weekend, so we made use of the nice gas fireplace. Mandy also provided us with umbrellas. The bed and pillows were a little too soft for us though. Every time my fiance moved, I got awoken because I was bouncing around! There was also a futon downstairs that we should've tried.

The neighborhood was a little interesting. There were brand new homes surrounded by fixer uppers, and there was an apartment complex next door. But we felt pretty safe. 

Overall, we would stay here again because Mandy was amazing and her home was really lovely. Thanks Mandy!"
7500000,46015412,2015-09-07,37833789,Kriss,"Mandy's home is absolutely charming just like the description. She is a master of ultilizing space and making it cozy with color texture and design. The loft style house was open, intimate, very clean and decorated with the perfect minimal northwest style. The master bed and bedding were a dream to sleep in and the kitchen easy to move about and cook. The gift of coffee, orange juice, bagels and cream cheese were perfect because I checked in at 11pm and did not make it to the store.  Mandy provided ideas of sights and tourism around the emerald city, which came in handy when the skies opened up and decided to pour changing our plans. Her home is located on a quiet street, but a close eight minutes away a full size grocery and the beautiful view of Seattle awaits. I felt very welcomed, thank you for the experience!

"
7500000,48583134,2015-09-27,11514570,Rachel,"We had the most wonderful stay here. My boyfriend and I brought my parents and our small dog and it was plenty spacious. Very cute, clean, nicely decorated, comfortable and accessible to downtown Seattle. "
7037291,42044033,2015-08-10,26681781,Chengjie,It is a very nice place. I can hardly any shortages. It is definitely a valuable and leisured place even for long time vacation. 
7037291,43286770,2015-08-18,25869178,Faisal,"Great Guy, Great environment, really feel like home, I had one week there and felt I was there for a long time, just really worth book with him if you are going to get a room through Airbnb in seattle downtown area.


"
7037291,43680330,2015-08-21,15634786,Lane,"A charming home surrounded by an absolutely beautiful garden area. The location was perfect for me while I worked downtown for a few days. Although, my schedule didn't allow for me to meet Doug in person, his welcome notebook and hand written post-it-note made me feel at home from the start. The personal towel bar, the robe and the toiletry kit added a nice personal touch. "
7037291,44175814,2015-08-24,39764431,Dongkyung,"I am sorry to comment late. I stayed there from on 20, Aug until 23 Aug with my friend.
He was very friendly and gave some tips so that we could travel perfectly. Even though he was absent when I arrived in his home, he made a guide book that made guests easy to read the rule.  
The location was so convinient that we could go around well-known landmark. The bus stop for downtown where it took just 2min by walk was right behind his house, so to get to downtown it takes just 10min. Also, the room was same with the room in the picture. it was so cozy room and quiet guests could sleep fast. Bathroom was very clean so if even women stay his house, it will never happen that they complain.   Avobe all things, what I striked my fancy was his personality. he was very kind and repectful to guests everytime.
I really appreciate Mr. Doug making our awesome trip!
"
7037291,44356153,2015-08-25,4694594,Jennifer,"Doug's home was lovely. This was our first time doing a single room with a shared bath. We've always rented an entire home, but our stay was less than 12 hours so it didn't make sense. This was a great experience. I think staying in someones home makes the stay cozy and warm. Doug corresponded with us prior to our arrival to make sure he was home when we arrived. We ended up arriving late evening, there was plenty of street parking. He took the time to sit and chat with us and made sure we had everything we needed. The bed was divine, he had set up a luggage stand in the closet and offered kimonos as robes. His whole house was filled with beautiful Asian art. We hope next time we have time to enjoy his beautiful garden, he's a landscape architect. We will definitely stay with him again."
7037291,44470768,2015-08-26,40817167,Sara,Wonderful stay! Doug was so flexible with our arrival time and very accommodating. Close location to downtown! Comfortable bed and such a nice place!
7037291,44696417,2015-08-28,15830239,Nanette,We enjoyed our brief stay on King St. It's an  interesting home with unique art and a fanatastic outdoor space.    Doug is very knowledgeable about the area and the helped with suggestions about dining and our upcoming trip to Olymipic National Park.  Will definitely stay there again.  Thanks Doug!
7037291,44823773,2015-08-29,38609318,Jacky,Great room with a really comfortable bed.  Doug and his niece were both really warm and welcoming and gave us great tips to explore around the city.
7037291,45129614,2015-08-31,39941602,Daanish,"Could not have been a better experience. Doug was a great guy - friendly and accommodating. The room was great - clean, comfortable and had everything I needed.  "
7037291,45400100,2015-09-02,39879988,Grace,"Sweet house. Doug is a good and responsible owner. But the location is a little far from the transportation,especially for us no driving visitors."
7037291,46297341,2015-09-09,40514185,Alissa,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Doug's for 7 days. It was great! Doug wasn't there, unfortunately, but let us know with time and left very detailed directions on how everything worked. He also left very helpful suggestions for travel around the city. Doug's niece Havala was extremely nice and accommodating during our stay. 

If we ever head back to Seattle, we'd love to stay here again. "
7037291,46908677,2015-09-14,2518872,Jeremy,"Simply awesome. We loved the house for its beautiful furniture, the neighborhood for its safety and relative ease to everything. We practically walked to the international district each day!
Great host, will definitely return."
7037291,47840259,2015-09-21,25628143,Giselle,"We spent the weekend at Doug's house. It is a very beautiful house with a stunning garden! We didn't have a car so the location was great because it was only a 20 minute walk to King Station and then it was a short bus ride into downtown. Although our time was short, we really enjoyed the house. The room very clean and comfortable!--Doug is a very kind person! He was also very helpful and knows many great places to eat! I recommend staying here and if we do get the chance we will come back."
7037291,48905849,2015-09-29,8089090,Caitriona,"Doug and his niece were extremely gracious. Starting with spiting their dinner with me on arrival (really considerate as I'd bee traveling for 40 odd hours at that stage). Very nice family - nice to chat to when they were around but with plenty of space around the house also. ....word of advice though don't gem em baked good to return the favor. They're literally and figuratively allergic. :-D

In terms of the house it's really well maintained in an established area. Really surprisingly close to downtown considering how quiet it was. I walked down to a Sea-hawks game one day and was there in less than 15 minutes. So have to say a superb location for that and heading into the heart of downtown. Nice Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants around too.

Basically superb host in a really convenient and surprisingly quiet part of Seattle.


"
7037291,49990296,2015-10-08,26819618,Bonnie,"I had a wonderful experience in Seattle and Doug's home was a big part of it!  His place was even better than I imagined. The home was beautiful, clean and inviting. The room was neat and cozy! I loved the bed! It was so comfortable that I spent the first hour of my day just laying in it not wanting to get up. 

The gardens around the house were beautiful! I loved sitting outside and relaxing in the yard. 

The neighborhood was very cool! It was in a very diverse area of the city and it literally took me 15 minutes to walk downtown. 

Doug was also very friendly and great to talk to when we did run into one another.

I plan on visiting Seattle again and would love to stay in Doug's place when I do. 

"
7037291,50112989,2015-10-09,41148522,Sandy,Nous sommes rest√©s une nuit chez Doug. Le quartier est tr√®s sympa et proche des transports en commun pour rejoindre le centre de Seattle. Doug est disponible et r√©pond √† toutes les questions rapidement. La chambre est propre et Doug met √† disposition serviettes de toilette. Le petit b√©mol est le manque d'isolation de la fen√™tre qui laisse passer tous les bruits ext√©rieurs et le froid.
7037291,50633271,2015-10-13,41472501,Gina,Excellent room and location to downtown. Host was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We had lots of privacy and felt very welcome to come and go as we please. I did not meet Doug in person as he was away during our stay but he was able to be reached easily if I would've had a problem. Neighborhood is safe and bed is comfortable! I highly recommend this place.  It is well worth your money!
7037291,51135208,2015-10-18,12481532,Lorrie,"Perfect!  Great location, sweet house with lots of interest. Very comfortable and enjoyable. "
7037291,51410529,2015-10-19,46647746,Landon,"The room was great! Had everything we needed, very comfortable and welcoming. The bed was extremely comfortable. All around a great stay and  location!"
7037291,52943515,2015-11-02,47718432,Benjamin,"I was in need of a place to stay on Halloween night. I booked the room just a couple of days a head of time and Doug was very quick to respond and provide all the needed information to enjoy my stay.  I arrived in the late evening to pick up keys. I returned to the house after midnight, was able to enter the house with no problems, outside was well lit and there was enough light in the house to easily navigate my way through. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. I was able to easily find towels and use the bathroom in the morning. I had packed enough, but there were extra toiletries if needed. I left the house at about 9am feeling well rested and ready to go. Great first time experience using AirBNB and would recommend this location to friends visiting Seattle."

7037291,54045967,2015-11-15,24736543,Aimee,The King Street Retreat was excellent.  Very comfortable and clean.  It felt very much like a home away from home. 
8373664,47928293,2015-09-21,17887154,Daniel,"Very clean, cozy and affordable apartment in a quiet, residential area! Roda and Marvin were very responsive and were tremendous lifesavers when another booking in the area fell through at the last minute. Also, accessibility to downtown shouldn't be an issue (~5-10m Uber ride away). Great balance between budget and convenience!"
8373664,48155119,2015-09-23,24292175,Catherine,"The location is great, and I felt very safe in the apartment.  Very clean, and Roda was very responsive to all of my questions!  "
8373664,48943484,2015-09-29,15789955,Andrea,"Roda's apartment is indeed bright and sunny! It has a nice view, all the modern conveniences, and is very clean. It's conveniently located near grocery stores, restaurants, and the Seattle Center. We always found a parking spot within a block of the apartment building. Overall, it was the right fit for us. 

Roda surprised us by having a pack n play set up in the bedroom for our three-year-old daughter. We were both thrilled and relieved to see it! She's very thoughtful and stocks some items in the kitchen such as tea, bottled water, popcorn --which our daughter enjoyed, etc. and helped us settle in. 

Lastly, Roda is incredibly responsive. Send her a question and she responds in record time. 

We'd definitely stay here again or in another one of her properties. "
8373664,51070275,2015-10-17,34050632,Dean,"Nice place.  As described.  I've been to 5 airBnB and this was my favorite.

 (Wonderful location if you are working at Amazon since it is a short walk.) "
4811583,24163691,2014-12-21,10647369,Li,"My husband and I stayed at Garo's place when we visited Seattle. The one bedroom apartment is spacious and everything is nice and clean. It is very close to the downtown, Pike Place, Space Needle and all other main attractions of the city and has the best view of the harbour. Garo is also very nice to talk to and helpful. I will definitely come back again!"
4811583,24619628,2014-12-31,25014763,Melissa,"The apartment was quiet, clean and serviceable; however, the pictures used to advertise it were misleading and did not show the actual space we rented. (Picture shows an ocean view, but the apartment actually overlooked a brick government building.) There were many advantages! Garo (the host) was super friendly (as were all the Ginosi Apartments staff) and quick to respond. They accommodated us when we arrived on Christmas day. The apartment was within close walking distance of many downtown attractions as well as Pioneer Square Station, which made it very easy to take the Central Link light rail to/from the airport. Also the neighborhood was nice. If you don't care about the view and just want quiet convenience while you explore the great city of Seattle, then I would recommend this place."

4811583,51596114,2015-10-21,21616327,Trudy,The listing photos accurately reflect the space.  The flat is beautiful and quaint. The location is close to the waterfront. You can Uber down to the pier or pike place market for less than $25.
6782993,35510996,2015-06-19,2773763,Jeff,"The Host made me feel very welcome...and was incredibly outgoing, caring, and gracious.  The Host also provided me with the necessities of the house in a timely manner. The House is very clean and my room was very comfortable and it had everything I could possibly need for my short stay.    The neighborhood is very safe and beautiful, as the neighborhood was once an apple orchard...so it has a country feel to it.   Furthermore the host knows the area very well and helped me feel right at home in the Seattle area. "
6782993,36447077,2015-06-28,35742846,Amanda,"This house was a wonderful solution for travelers looking for a room. The bunk beds were comfortable and suitable for a weekend trip. Logan is a terrific host, very kind and friendly. The overall house atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. This room is located 15 minutes (without traffic) from downtown Seattle. It was ideal for a shopping weekend where we spent our days in the city and came in late at night to sleep in the room. The house was clean and wifi access was extremely useful. Overall, a great experience for 2 sisters taking a weekend shopping trip. This room is recommended for flexible travelers looking for a cheap and reliable sleeping option.
"
6782993,37275714,2015-07-05,37027333,Darren,"Logan was an excellent host! She is very friendly and accommodating. The home is beautiful and well kept. It was too bad I didn't realize she was a trained chef until it was time to, I would have tried to bribe her to cook sumthin!"
6782993,38183426,2015-07-13,2072914,Dan,"Comfortable, quiet, with soft blankets. This room is just as described, and more when you take Logan into account. She's interesting, fun, talented, and accommodating. I like the little thoughtful touches she offers."

6782993,39113717,2015-07-20,38279812,Alexander,"There is a simple word for our stay at Logan's - great! First of all she was incredibly spontaneous taking us in like last minute and from the second we got there we felt very welcome! The room was clean and she provided us with everything we might need! We just stayed for three nights but as far as we can tell Logan is very open-minded, sweet and caring!! Bus Nr. 41 takes you straight downtown and also other destinations were easily reachable! We'd definitely stay there again!!!! "
6782993,39470243,2015-07-23,1319017,Pj,Great stay in a comfortable house!

6782993,40190132,2015-07-28,8499110,Patrick,"Very straight forward, as advertised. Nice host and clean place. Single bathroom and a door right next to another person, so it's not a private room. Overall positive."
6782993,40299748,2015-07-29,3687713,Jeff,"Super nice host, gracious, and timely in her communications. Nice neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle. I was in and out quickly but I know Logan would have been very helpful with guidance had I requested it. Room and home are as described online. "
6782993,40661231,2015-08-01,3213004,Amanda,"Staying with Logan was wonderful!  She was so welcoming and so sweet.  The bunk beds were totally fine for my friend and I who were just staying there to sleep and using all the time out exploring Seattle.  It did not take long at all to get to downtown Seattle from Logan's place (we did have a car).  We were here for 3 days, and it was a perfect place to crash from our travels.  Thanks Logan!"
6782993,40872343,2015-08-02,39778805,Edmond,"Logan was a very lovely and welcoming lady, she made both of us felt at home. She is also very interesting and we have had a lot of fun talking to her and knowing more about the city. She shows great hospitality and we could say for sure it was one of the best experience.


The room is very clean, comfy and cozy. We had a very good nights sleep. The house was also very tidy and certainly welcoming. The two house cats were also friendly.

The neighbourhood was very quiet and felt safe and secure. There were some nice pubs just down the road with nice breakfast and food."
6782993,41981706,2015-08-10,36482313,Morgan,"Logan was incredible. Our group had some unexpected things happen and she was such a gracious host. Room was excellent, comfortable and functional, and the location was excellent as it was surrounded by shops that were within a short distance. Neighborhood was quiet, and easily accessed! But nothing beats Logan, who was exceedingly helpful and understanding! "
6782993,42364078,2015-08-12,39083009,Carl,This was my second time staying at Logan's and the room was great. It's great whether your out on the town or if you are spending the day relaxing inside. The host makes sure that everything is clean and makes sure you have what you need or helps you find it...the room and host made my seattle experience a postive one.
6782993,42636108,2015-08-14,20904105,Nikko,Nothing but good things to say. Very affordable room with comfy bunk beds. Logan was super friendly and incredibly welcoming.
6782993,42752682,2015-08-15,1615852,Tammy,"Unfortunately I couldn't make my reservation with Logan at ""Sunny & Simple in Seattle"".  Logan was very understanding & was ready with some fresh fruits for us which I look forward to another time!  Will definitely want to check out Logan's place for my next visit.   Tammy"

6782993,46254299,2015-09-08,43463869,Cormac,"Sunny and Simple is very apt - the room is nothing special but it is very comfortable and does the job very well. The neighborhood is pleasant enough, if a little far out of Seattle; if you have a car it shouldn't be any problem at all. Logan was very sweet and incredibly helpful, and she really helped make our trip a memorable one."
6782993,51251964,2015-10-18,33171308,Bevin Victoria,This listing was exactly what I hoped it would be. My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Logan was the picture of hospitality and very warm and understanding when a sudden change in our plans came up. 
6782993,52033729,2015-10-25,47274680,Ahndiana,"This was my first time in the area and my very first AIR BnB experience. I felt right at home. Logan was an excellent host! She was so sweet, friendly and full of energy! Comfy pillows and blankets, heater, towels, everything covered. Absolutely perfect! The place was near the bus stop and a couple blocks from stores/restaurants. I would definitely stay here again."

4559222,25973554,2015-01-31,14152425,Charlene,"Thanks for Joan and Markos given our couples the very nice experience. They are so nice people. The room is very quite, comfortable and stylish. 

We stayed here for 10 days. This is our first experience for Airbnb, at the same time, this is our first experience for living with non-Chinese family. Joan and Markos given us very worm feeling. They have an open mind with different cultures and they love music, arts, dogs, flowers and so on. We can talk about lots of things even though my English is poor and my husband can't speak English. 

At here we want thanks again for Joan and Markos that the delicious dinner we were together and thanks Joan's home style muffins. We are missing you guys and your loving dog Harvey( I think his name spell like this), your chickens, hummingbird and your loving yards, even though the flowers not yet blooming at winter."
4559222,30426495,2015-04-21,7287049,Benjamin,"MY stay with Joan and Markos was VERY pleasant.  They were very welcoming, friendly, engaging, hospitable, and just very pleasant in general. The room and surroundings were just ast described in the listing here, so there were no surprises except that the house was even cozier than the pictures could convey.  I would certainly recommend that you stay here - It will be nice. Thank you to the both of you! "
4559222,31528725,2015-05-06,9985502,Na,"It was a wonderful time to stay in Joan and Markos's house,they are very friendly,they pick us up from the light railway when we arrive from airport and drive us back to the airport when we were leaving.they even prepare breakfast for us in morning, give us so many information for us to travel around seattle.we chat a lot,it was enjoyable to chat with them.we sing songs together,Joan plays
musics on ukulele,Markos has a great voice,is was fun!Their house is huge and nice,have a great view of Washington lake,and their garden is beautiful.Their dog is cute. If next time we are going to Seattle we will definitely stay their house again!"
4559222,33109346,2015-05-25,30745817,Jill,"Great experience in Seattle. We've been to a lot of places, such as Space Needle, first Starbucks, South Lake Union, University of Washington and Pike market. Unlike LA, the public transportation is easy to from our place to downtown, and we did not need to focus on driving. Also, our host gave us many information and picked us up at airport when we arrived as well as drove us to the light rail station when we leaving. As the host described that the house is located in a good neighborhood, the room is comfortable with lake view, easy to take light rail or bus to downtown and we can use the kitchen to make coffee, etc. Also, after we talked with host, we have known too many information about Seattle  that made us like local.

Joan and Markos are so likable and warm-hearted and made us feel at home during our tree days stay. In the guest room and the small room nearby we had enough space for our belongings and suitcases. The bed was totally comfortable. We enjoyed the time with Joan and Markos and their lovely dog Yavi very much and appreciated the conversations we had. 
4559222,34640216,2015-06-10,32168537,Muktesh,"Joan and Markos are extremely friendly and made us feel at home. We loved staying at their place. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. 
The neighborhood is scenic and their deck has a great lake view.
If you are visiting Seattle I highly recommend staying here.


"
4559222,34892559,2015-06-13,17384682,Taryn,"Joan and Markos were great hosts! I stayed with them for a few days and really enjoyed sitting out on their beautiful backyard patio in the mornings. They were happy to offer up some sightseeing suggestions and had a nice little basket of resources and maps, too. Thumbs up!"
4559222,36394237,2015-06-28,1470798,Toni & Jay,"What fun we had in Seattle at Joan and Markos place. Joan was kind enough to give us a ride from the light rail and back a couple of times, but also they made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed the view from the deck every day as we planned what to do next in Seattle. Our room was perfect and Toni enjoyed the adjacent spare room as a place to watch the sunrise (time change so we got up early). The neighborhood was a nice walk and we  loved Markos flowers. Also, the local coffee shop was a plus. We felt very at home there and would recommend to others who want a comfortable stay in Seattle. Easy travel with light rail, bus system, ferry and now Lyft. "
4559222,40721724,2015-08-02,9436557,Fiona,"Joan und Markos haben uns am Abend unserer Anreise in Empfang genommen und wir haben uns sofort wohl gef√ºhlt. Das Haus ist wundersch√∂n gelegen und auch die Beschreibung hat gepasst. Das Zimmer ist super gem√ºtlich und der Garten, welchen man inklusive Gem√ºse und Sitzplatz mit Aussicht auf den Lake Washington nutzen kann, ist einfach toll! Mit dem Bus kommt man direkt in die Stadt und auch in der n√§heren Umgebung gibt es viele sehenswerte Attraktionen wie der Kubota Garden oder der Seward Park. Wir k√∂nnen einen Aufenthalt bei Joan und Markos w√§rmstens empfehlen und werden jederzeit gerne wieder vorbei schauen.
"
4559222,45244739,2015-09-01,24346158,Kyoko,"Joan and Markos list two separate rooms on airbnb, and each room has a picture of beautiful bathroom, which was very tricky to me. I actually had to share a bathroom with a man I don't know who was staying at the other room on the same floor. In addition, I had to stay with the man while Joan and Marks were out for their vacation. That had NOT been informed to me until I arrived to Seattle.

Fortunately, I have very nice friends in Seattle and they helped me to find the other room to stay. But I worry a lot if it happens to an woman from foreign countries who can not have that kind of support.

I strongly recommend that you make sure the point before you make the reservation.
"
4559222,49520044,2015-10-04,16688129,Dmitry,"Joan and Markos were extremely welcoming, thoughtful and considerate. The room matched the description in full, and it's been a great pleasure to stay at their house.
Located in a lush green and quiet neighborhood, close to the lake and a few great cafe's and coffee stores in the area. Only a 10-minute walk from the Light Rail station that can get you to the Airport, downtown and everywhere in between. Not even talking about multiple bus lines running anywhere you need to get. We didn't even rent a car for the most part of our stay - it was very convenient and cheap to use the public means of transportation.
We were over the moon happy with our stay and our hosts, that made us feel at home without any additional efforts. They have been living in that area for quite a while, and are knowledgeable regarding the best hikes, restaurants, attractions in Seattle and beyond.
Provided in the room were not only essentials, but also a huge pile of current informational brochures and magazines covering all the variety that Seattle has to offer. We've traveled quite a lot around the block and added to that stack some versatility that might be helpful to the visitors of different ages and spheres of interests. Highly encouraging other visitors to contribute to that mini library of brochures.
Words cannot express how thankful to the Universe my wife and I are to get a chance to meet such an amazing couple as Joan and Markos!
Would have given 6 Star rating if I could."
4559222,50501403,2015-10-12,39194105,Diane,"Joan and Markos are very friendly and Polite. They made us feel like home from the minute we walked in. This is the Perfect place to stay if you are going to Seattle. Super comfortable bed, good size bedroom. Many restaurant around the area with yummy food. Great location, close to downtown.  A beautiful view of the lake. And to make it better     ""Javi"" their little dog its the cutest thing ever and super-friendly! 

Thank you guys!

6813623,35971962,2015-06-23,6660762,Elizabeth,"It was a fabulous experience being the first tenant of this wonderful house in Northeast.  On a quiet street with a beautiful, private front and back year, the house felt peaceful and relaxing.  There is plenty of room for 5 in three bedrooms and two full baths.  The kitchen has high end appliances and a granite countertop, with all of the amenities if you like to cook.  Anna was very responsive , and the wine, chocolate and bread were all wonderful welcome gifts for our stay.  I would definitely rent this house again on a future trip to Seattle."
6813623,36991011,2015-07-03,17309084,Yi,She is quite helpful arranging everything.
6813623,37681885,2015-07-09,35885638,Aaron,"The house sits on a nice, quiet street and was easy to get to. We were welcomed by a nice bottle of wine and a personal note from our host (thank you)!  The home has a nice, clean, urban feel and Anna did not skimp on furnishings or provisions for bedding, bath or kitchen. If you enjoy browsing through the West Elm or Crate & Barrel catalogs, then you will enjoy your visit here.

My wife normally packs additional kitchenwares and other necessities when we travel, but we didn't need any of it this time. Just about everything we could think of was already provided for us. It's been unusually hot this summer in Seattle and Anna was kind enough to deliver an additional fan to keep the house cool during our stay.

Having the convenience of a large washer/dryer was great and we washed several loads of laundry. The bedrooms are large and the beds/linens were comfortable as well. We also took advantage of Netflix each evening to watch movies.

I would recommend Anna's house to anyone visiting the Seattle area and would be happy to stay here again."
6813623,38318761,2015-07-14,17924139,Denis,We did not meet Anna in person but she was a very attentive host through our email/text exchanges. The house was as described by the listing in a perfectly quiet and green neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay there...
6813623,38773565,2015-07-18,37839190,Amrit,Anna was very thoughtful in leaving a welcome gift for us. The directions to the place were very detailed and helpful. Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. She was also very very acommodating in taking care of some last minute details fro us and was always only an email away. Always responded quickly.Was very thoughtful of OUR privacy.
6813623,39537274,2015-07-24,37627782,Richard,"We felt very welcome, the house was very roomy for my family and the neighborhood was quiet.  The kids loved visiting with the neighbor's cat and sleeping in a different bed every night."
6813623,41962747,2015-08-10,34875358,Sheryl,"My stay at this Peaceful Garden Home of Anna's was my first experience using airbnb and I can honestly say that after this experience I will be looking at this option for future trips.  This house is exactly what we expected based upon the description and my conversations with Anna.  It is a beautiful and comfortable home that allows you to relax. My kids were very happy that we were staying there rather than a hotel in the city.  I found myself referring to it as ""going home"" at the end of our long days at The International. The drive to and from the city was easy and direct.  The appliances are new and something I would love in my own home.  We had an issue with a breaker and that was taken care of very quickly though they were not in the area.  They were very considerate of our needs/comfort and just a true pleasure to work with.  If you need a place to stay in the area and are considering this home I can tell you it is a great choice that you will not regret making!"
6813623,42903650,2015-08-16,13415253,Miyeon,"Our stay was wonderful. The house was perfect! Absolutely spotless. We felt at home the moment we entered (and it was 1 AM!). The neighborhood was quiet and safe. In the back yard a garden supplied a  the ingredients for a yummy salad. All ""essentials"" were present as advertised. The house was close to key road access points but no traffic sounds were heard. Beds were comfortable and rooms spacious. Frankly, a home like this reinforces our devotion to airbnb as a preferable alternative to the usual hotel experience. We will definitely come back (we have family in the area) and strongly recommend` this property!"
6813623,45942405,2015-09-07,6436891,Emily,"This house is a peaceful and beautiful oasis. Tastefully and comfortably decorated, clean, and spacious. Anna was communicative during our stay. They left us a beautiful welcome gift which was appreciated. We loved the location, and the house is a true gem. My children were so happy here, and especially loved the backyard. Being from New York City, we truly enjoyed the peaceful garden, fruit and fig trees, fresh veggies and grapes from the vine. We are so fortunate to have enjoyed our three weeks here in this beautiful home. I hope we can return again!"
6813623,49027086,2015-09-30,8060708,Yiling,We really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful and comfortable house. Definitely a great house to stay during your trip to seattle!

4287974,29821942,2015-04-13,343983,Holly,"Dan was so warm and welcoming! He had set out a few special toys for our young son and really made us feel comfortable. We had little interaction with him through out our stay, but it was mostly due to us being out and busy! He called and checked in on us and was definitely available had we needed anything.
Thanks Dan!"

My parents really enjoyed Dan's place and the location.  If you are visiting Seattle and looking for a quiet neighborhood in the NE, this is a great option."
4287974,32872179,2015-05-22,32386897,Nicole,Dan's home was the perfect place to host our business partners and show off our city. It was as described and very comfortable. The best part is the private garden off to the side of the house - beautiful and peaceful. Dan was very welcoming to our guests and by extension made us look good too! Thanks Dan! 
4287974,32943283,2015-05-23,33156200,Teresa,"Dan was very responsive and accommodated a stay for 5 members of my organization. I didn't get to see the space myself, but our guests raved about it being a lovely, comfortable retreat!"
4287974,33112859,2015-05-25,862177,Fran And Ken,"We found Dan's place just right for our weekend in Seattle. Location, cleanliness, privacy, amenities, and comfort...all were there. Dan is a gracious host, welcoming and attentive to our needs. The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and well maintained. Parking was no problem, a nice feature in Seattle. We recommend this cozy hideaway.  "
4287974,33557751,2015-05-29,25019532,Nozomi,"Both Dan's place and Dan was great! We were on a roadtrip from CA and had to check in really late.  Despite him having to wake up super early the next morning, he allowed us to stay.  He is super responsive and the house was perfect for the four of us travelers. Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling in the Seattle area by car.  Thank you Dan! Hopefully we will get to meet you next time :)"
4287974,34018058,2015-06-03,33539003,Manuel,"This place is cozy indeed. Dan is a fantastic host, out of sight and out of mind, but always responsive to email and text messages. Great central location for Seattle area to launch excursions from.  Clean, comfortable, and a pleasant, private garden to enjoy."
4287974,34304046,2015-06-07,30910016,Lydia,"Enjoyed our stay with Dan. The two bedrooms are comfortable, the garden is beautiful, and the living area is spacious. Beautiful neighborhood! "

4287974,34851901,2015-06-13,4291200,Chris,We had a wonderful experience staying at Dan's place. The place is very comfortable and clean. Dan is very accommodating and offered to drive us to my daughter 's UW graduation. I will definitely come back next time.
4287974,35790792,2015-06-22,31435378,Daniel,"We had a nice stay, good location from which to explore Seattle and the surrounding area!  The neighborhood was quiet and centrally located so we did not need to drive too far to get anywhere we wanted to go.  Dan was accessible and helpful upon our arrival and even made a few suggestions for dining and activities that we appreciated since it was our first time in Seattle.  Would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting the area!"
4287974,36119782,2015-06-25,31651578,James,"Dan was very helpful, the accommodation was perfect for us, and the location was great for exploring Seattle."
4287974,36288498,2015-06-27,32544125,Barry,"Clean and comfortable accommodations and caring host. Great location, what more could you need! Highly recommend staying here."
4287974,36409364,2015-06-28,556911,Al,"Dan's place was great and was more than enough for our quick weekend in Seattle. 

We took up the whole ground floor and it's suited with all the things you need - kitchen, shower bathroom, internet, big living room and amazing entertainment system. We were two and we each had our own bedroom.

Dan is one of the nicest airbnb hosts I've met. Very personable, flexible, make you feel very welcome and gives a very good introduction of what you need to know about the place. He offered nice wine bottle upon our stay which is very generous and gave us tips on what to do for the city. He had a folder with all the information to orient yourself with Seattle but with such a short stay he gave us ideas on what to check out for during our time frame.

The place is within a residential area and a very safe neighbourhood. It's about a 2 minutes drive away to the closest supermarket, 7 minutes drive to a mall (safeway, apple store, H&M) and 8 minutes to the University of Washington football stadium. The track to run down to the stadium is nice for a morning run. :)

We relied on google maps to direct us into downtown towards the Space Needle and it took us 17 minutes.

We had a great time in Seattle and Dan's place was something to look forward to after a long drive down from Vancouver and spending a day downtown.

Thank you Dan! We will definitely have a look at your place again when we return, especially if we come back as a family of 4 people."
4287974,42780600,2015-08-15,40882318,Sarah,"We were delighted to find Dan's place on airbnb for our family of 4. It was true to the description. The neighborhood is charming and the location was very convenient for the university district. We stayed for a week, and found it very easy to get downtown, to CenturyLink and Pike Market in a short amount of time. Dan welcomed us when we arrived with a bottle of wine & was a nice, helpul host. As active as we were, we didn't see much of him though. The home is quiet and comfortable, and had such a relaxing zen feel with the private botanical garden.  We greatly enjoyed our stay, and would love to stay again!"
4287974,43776807,2015-08-22,36352238,Steve,"Dan was very accommodating; always available for directions and advice about how to get around Seattle and where to eat, etc. The neighborhood was quiet and conveniently located. Parking was never a problem (as it can be in Seattle). The space was clean and comfortable. I'd stay here again."
4287974,44016975,2015-08-23,17571114,Scott,"Dan was a great host - he greeted us, showed us around the unit and  helped us get situated in the city. The place was exactly how it was described and was clean/comfortable and perfect for our group (4 adults).

The neighborhood was quiet and conveniently located within Seattle with readily available street parking. We would definitely stay here again."
4287974,44437442,2015-08-26,28843840,Diana,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Dan's home. The first night it was my husband and me and our daughter and son-in-law and their baby and we were all very comfortable. The neighborhood is great; quiet and beautiful gardens; lots of great walking areas, and it is very convenient to anything you might need. Plenty of parking. The home and patio/garden area is very clean and relaxing, and Dan was very helpful. Would definitely recommend."
4287974,44718926,2015-08-28,41137255,Scarlett,"Dan was a very warm and welcoming host. 
He greeted us with a bottle of wine and some good chat which cheered us up immensely after a long flights get to Seattle. 
His house was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. 
I would defiantly stay here again! 
Thanks Dan for such a warm welcome to Seattle! "
4287974,44910585,2015-08-30,3353335,Dan,"Dan was great. He was there when we checked in and helped us get situated. Perfect walking neighborhood with views of the water.

 "
4287974,45417717,2015-09-02,39750582,ÁëÄÁèä,Dan is a really nice person and the neighborhood is quit fancy too. It is a very good experience in Seattle. If we come back this winter I'd love to rent this house again absolutely !
4287974,46372596,2015-09-10,1323750,Connie,"Dan was extremely welcoming and helpful.  The apartment is private, quiet, well -furnished and is in a great area of Seattle near the UW."
4287974,46625583,2015-09-12,7840641,Thomas,"Prior to arrival, Dan was proactive in contacting us: once a week in advance to confirm arrival details and once on the day of arrival to notify us that the cleaning crew had left the towels in the dryer. Space is comfortable and quiet, with two legitimate bedrooms and a lovely outdoor garden patio. Restaurants and markets are within a few minutes by car (Metropolitan Market is pricey but has great prepared food and the world's best chocolate chip cookies, and Mio Posto has authentic Italian fare). "
4287974,48376210,2015-09-26,32603597,Kristinn,"Hi!
We came from Norway and lived in Dan's Apartment in Seattle for two weeks, and that was a very comfortable and relaxing vacation. Dan is a super host, he helped us and was a very nice guy.
We liked the apartment and the area/neighbourhood very much. It vas cosy and relaxing, and the stores we wanted/needed were in the close neigbourhood.
Dan told us about the best and most important things to see and explore i Seattle and in the surroundings and we had a great time.
Thanks a lot to Dan - we recommend the flat. We might come back! Best greetings from Kristinn og S√∏lvi"
4287974,48572308,2015-09-27,24209606,Jenny,"Dan's garden apartment was a clean, spacious and inviting place.  It is located in a lovely residential neighborhood but in easy walking distance to trails, cafes and other cute shops.  While Dan was out of town during our stay, he was still in contact and made us feel welcome.  My entire family enjoyed our stay."
4287974,54385541,2015-11-19,28843840,Diana,"This was a second visit for my husband and me. This is a very nice and comfortable home. We were here during some stormy, cold weather, and it really was cozy, with a fire in the fireplace, curled up with a blanket and a book, and then out for walks when the sun came out; beautiful neighborhood. Markets and restaurants and some shopping in the area are convenient. The owner, Dan, is one of the kindest people we have met, which was very welcome as we are going through some hard health things now (thus our visit to Seattle). He is very accommodating and helpful and fun to talk to. Thank you, Dan!"
4287974,54614563,2015-11-22,47486331,Kristina,"Great place to stay, convenient location, wonderful host! "
4287974,55179358,2015-11-28,47220969,Lezan,"Dan's house is really nice. It is really clean, warm and comfortable. The community which Dan's house in is very nice too. Dan is very friendly and kindly. I suffered some problems when I booked the house but he helped me a lot to solve the problems. Dan also recommend me many interesting places to travel. If you want to travel in Seattle, I strongly recommend Dan's house."
4287974,58224010,2016-01-01,15404472,Claudia,"Dan's home was a perfect place for me, my fianc√©e, and two friends on New Year's Eve.  We all sat around the fire and watched the fireworks and ball drop from his TV in the living room with surround sound, which was perfect. Both rooms and beds were comfortable and cozy.  The location is great with a view of Seattle right outside.  I got to meet Dan and his family and they are the sweetest people you could ever meet.  We were lucky to have found his home.  Highly recommended!"
8637174,49302650,2015-10-02,2216874,Justin,Great location with easy walking distance to all over the city.  Apartment had everything I needed to enjoy a comfortable evening in.  Highly recommend this place as it meets all your needs for visiting the city.  Thanks again Kumail!
8637174,49737911,2015-10-05,1363807,Justine,"My friends and I had a wonderful experience this past weekend.  The studio was a great size, in perfect condition and in an amazing location! It was walking distance to everything we wanted to see and Kumail was beyond helpful throughout the whole trip.  I will definitely be staying here the next time I am in town. "
8637174,49860384,2015-10-06,44535748,Michael,Kumail was a great host.  He coordinated check-in without a hitch and his apartment was extremely clean.  I would recommend staying here or any other place that Kumail is hosting.
8637174,49965810,2015-10-07,37011254,Rex + Melissa,"My family and I needed a space to rent with day - of notice and thank goodness we found Kumail's downtown apartment. He was extremely helpful, check in/out process was so easy and very detailed. The apartment was nice, very clean and had everything we needed plus was stocked with essentials. Amazing location downtown within walking distance of everything! Kumail also made himself available if we were to need anything! Definitely recommend this apartment! "
8637174,50057702,2015-10-08,45853963,Rachelle,"Very clean home was my first impression. There is everything you need, from toothpaste to extra towels. Everything was correct with the instructions, and very smooth process getting into the home. Even though it was street parking, we found plenty of spaces in front of the building. "
8637174,50550533,2015-10-12,28246138,Francis,"The listing description was extremely accurate. This place is exactly close enough to walk to pike place and far enough away from the tourist. It's about a 5 minute walk to Pike place and to the left, a 5 minute walk to downtown stores (nordstrom, zara, etc).
If that is not with your liking, super close to restaurants in the neighborhood to grab food close by. Umi sushi is great, the crocodile for music is 3 blocks away.
It has a wonderful doughnut shop next door, where you can grab a quick bite and coffee.
In terms of the place, code entry for both the outside and studio, which makes the key hassle easy. Comfortable bed and great simple toiletries to save some extra space in your luggage.  We didn't use the kitchen but Kumali provides stuff to eat leftovers, store food in the fridge, etc.
Overall, wonderful stay. He was accessible by message, checking in and check-out was effortless."
8637174,50911074,2015-10-15,26503482,Jolie,"Kumail did a wonderful job of accommodating me last minute.  My plans fell through in Seattle and when I sent out several inquiries, he was one of the first to respond.  He was communicative and quick.  The place in Belltown was cute, clean and exactly what I needed!  Thank you, again!"
8637174,51478307,2015-10-20,42002094,Stephanie,"Kumail's place is perfectly described. It was clean, easily accessed, and in a convenient area of town. Pikes place market is less than a 10 minute stroll, the space needle about 12 minute walk, and a bunch of good eats within minutes of walking. I like walking and I was able to walk all the way to downtown Seattle and Pioneer Square within 20-30 minutes. Otherwise, lyfts and ubers are about $7-10.

Kumail's communication was speedy and he was very accommodating. A few days before our arrival I asked if he had a hair dryer and iron. He said he didn't but when we arrived, he had gotten us both and left it in the closet. 

Two negatives about the place is that it can be very noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. There are two residential buildings across each side of the building. If you do not pull the shades down, the neighbors will see your goodies (but this can be anywhere, just giving a heads up). Otherwise, my friends and I really enjoyed our stay! "
8637174,51568228,2015-10-21,35245373,Karen,We had a great visit to Seattle staying at this apartment. Kumail provided all information that we needed for our stay. The bed was super comfy!
8637174,52607349,2015-10-31,45521177,Aishwarya,"Kumail's apartment was the first one I booked using airbnb and I had a great experience. 

Firstly, it's located in a prime location and that makes it easy to get to most tourist spots around the area by walk or by buses. The apartment was cozy, compact and comfortable. It was very clean and well maintained. Kumail was very helpful and responsive. Overall, I would totally recommend it. "
8637174,52724851,2015-11-01,35311233,Samantha,Great little place for the 4 of us!
8637174,53164082,2015-11-05,7604126,Deidra,"The place is JUST how it appears, clean, comfortable, and absolutely wonderful to stay in! The beds (we used the foldout queen couch as well as the regular bed) are very comfortable, and there are plenty of extra towels, sheets, soaps, etc. Kumail was fast to respond, and gave us all the info so we could let ourselves in late in the eve when we got here - TOO easy! Also, about a 5 min walk to shops, and 8 min to Pike's Place Market - couldn't ask for a more convenient location. The only drawback I experienced was in regards to the noise... as the condo IS in the heart of the city - traffic can be noisy at night if you're not used to it. Otherwise - GREAT place to stay, would def recommend! 

Thanks, 
Deidra"
8637174,53988652,2015-11-15,46335764,Kevin,Kumail's apt was great! It had everything we needed and the location was great. Everything we wanted to see in Seattle was either a short walk or a quick uber away. Would certainly book again if we get back to Seattle! Thanks!
8637174,54172582,2015-11-16,48027305,Tyler,"Kumail was very accommodating and helpful. The place was perfect. Great location, very clean and nice decor. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Kumail!"
8637174,54391690,2015-11-19,12547018,Jess,"Amazing place! Super clean and well kept! The location is fantastic, and 
in walking distance or a quick uber to everywhere we needed to go. The keyless entry made it super easy to come and go! Kumail was amazing with communication, always responded quickly, and even accommodated an early check in. The bed is very comfy and the apt was warm and cozy even during a storm! It was exactly what we were looking for and we will definitely stay here during our next trip to Seattle. "
8637174,54446447,2015-11-20,18215117,Paul,"Kumail was great, excellent feedback and follow through. The place is really cool, comfortable, and in a great location, close to everything. Its a little noisy on 5th Ave at night, so be prepared, but its worth it to be right in the thick of things..."
8637174,54597605,2015-11-22,14335541,Amy,Great location. Easy instructions on arrival as to how to gain entrance to the suite. Clean and comfortable.

8637174,55218489,2015-11-29,46714987,Terri,Very nice place to stay.  Close to everything for easy walking.  Everything was clean and as described by owner and transaction was a breeze.

8637174,55634728,2015-12-03,47954604,Russell,"Location was perfect! The studio was clean and had the bare necessities. I would definitely come back next time. I do wish that the host provided real cutlery and dishes, cooking was never an option because there was only paper products provided. "
8637174,56214135,2015-12-10,1282297,Jonathan,A great stay in Seattle! Kumail provided detailed instructions prior to arrival on how to get into the apartment and apartment amenities. Everything was as expected and the studio was very centrally located. Close to downtown and easy access to transport throughout the city. 
8637174,56673445,2015-12-16,48511364,Praise,"The condo was less than a 15 minute walk from all the major attractions and restaurants, which made it so convenient to sightsee. The condo was clean, well-kept, and had everything we needed for a fun stay. Kumail was helpful and prompt in communicating with us. Thanks so much for your hospitality! "
8637174,56781423,2015-12-18,47141150,Thao,"This place is very nice and cozy, good location. It was nice of the host to provide us with plenty of water and towels. Easy and convenient to get in with the codes. I would definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle. "
8637174,57125161,2015-12-22,46858923,Brenda,"We arrived late at night and we were met with a truly charming studio--in what we would later find out is a central location for all the tourist spots. Whether through walking or public transit (which is relatively inexpensive), we found ourselves at most of the items in our itinerary in a matter of minutes. 
In regards to the studio, although we had imagined that we would be crammed in like sardines, it was actually accommodating with its superb layout for our party of five. We were even surprised at the large walk-in closet that came with the place. It truly felt like we were at home!
Throughout the whole process, Kumail did an exceptional job, especially in regards to communication because his responses were always timely. Best of all, this place gave us the best return on the dollar. We are thankful that we found this place."
8637174,57314509,2015-12-24,31236481,Jessica,"Kumail's place was exceptional for our stay being that it was really close to everything my gf and I wanted to visit. Parking was easy during later hrs. We always had a parking spot before we got back. It was a little noisy at night, but it was actually soothing. Kumail responded quickly to my texts/calls so that's always a plus.

The only con was that before checking in, we decided we wanted to cook spaghetti for dinner, assuming since there was a kitchen that there will be cookware. Nope. All good though. . We bought a pot and a couple cooking utensils for future guests (read the journal for our experience). Happy holidays!"
8637174,57521291,2015-12-27,33035147,Oscar,"The apartment had a great location, walking distance to several restsurants, bars and caf√©s. It was surprisingly spacious too. There was plenty of parking spots nearby.

Would stay again!"

The location is perfect for all attractions around Seattle, couldn't have asked for a better place! The host is very responsive and helped out with all questions. Great place and great host 10/10 visit! "
6938542,37599757,2015-07-08,17007742,Jorge,"Can we just stay in this little gem for the rest of the year?! The Private Inlaw Unit is located in a charming neighborhood with picturesque houses that are unique and beautifully landscaped. 

Our private unit was beautifully laid out, clean and orderly. It felt as if we were staying with family or friends. The quarters were more than spacious and the lighting from the windows was refreshing in the mornings and late evenings. The cork floors and modern finishes were very aesthetically pleasing. I don‚Äôt think its mentioned on the listing but the Unit has a private entrance. This was our first Airbnb stay and I cannot express how relaxing it was versus a hotel.  

Jonathan and Tamara were extremely accommodating and welcomed us the minute we arrived with dining suggestions. Lucky for us, we stayed here during the 4th of July and we were able to experience the main fireworks event with the neighborhood overlooking Lake Union. Jonathan and Tamara introduced us to their family and neighbors AND shared their blankets with us! 

Our stay could not have been more wonderful! Thank You!
"
6938542,37784439,2015-07-10,21205976,Tarra,"What an incredible private suite. Even better than one you can get at a hotel. It was beautifully decorated and very inviting. Jonathan kept in contact with us up until our arrival and greeted (zombie-no sleep) us with a warm welcome and kindness. Did I mention he let us check in early? 

We would definitely stay in this space again if ever visiting Seattle. Would 100% recommend it. "
6938542,38310125,2015-07-14,36440720,Yairmari,"Jonathan & Tamara have your home away from home. Their in-law apartment is very welcoming and have everything that you'll need during your stay with tiny details like toiletries, reading lamps and board games. They even have Netflix! We asked for an earlier check-in since our flight was getting in before check-in time and they were able to accommodate us. They suggested great places to visit in the area and how to get around. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area and is looking for a great and affordable place to stay. "
6938542,39649192,2015-07-25,5237534,Amanda,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights while we explored Seattle for our first time and it was an absolutely wonderful place to stay :). Jonathan and Tamara were so welcoming and they really made sure we had everything we needed. The space is so sweet and cozy and thoughtfully put together, everything was impeccably clean and we were just so thankful to find it! Our most favorite part was the neighborhood. Waking up in the morning and taking long walks in the beautiful surroundings was the best! The bed and the couch were also very very comfortable. Thank  you for making our stay in Seattle so great! :)  "
6938542,39964518,2015-07-27,3311969,Lori,"Jonathan and Tamara were very personable and made us feel welcome to their beautiful and comfortable home.  Their mother-in-law unit with private entry, bath, bedroom, mini-kitchen and livingroom provided a very comfortable base for exploring Seattle.  It's location was ideal for this purpose too...north end of Capitol Hill.  Bed was super comfy!  We plan to come back annually, and absolutely will stay here again."
6938542,40254086,2015-07-29,5244528,Raissa,"Our favorite stay during our trip through the Pacific Northwest. Jonathan & Tamara were welcoming, friendly, and helpful with restaurant recommendations. The space was beautifully decorated with bright colors and very clean. We were given access to a separate private mini kitchen. We would definitely stay here again."
6938542,40951276,2015-08-03,37326552,Ron,"From our initial contact to check out, Jonathan and Tamara did a great job of staying in touch with us and providing the information we needed.  We found the place to be exactly as described and it was just what we were looking for.    The neighborhood was nice and they provided us with a number of options for restaurants and refreshments in the area.  The chocolate chip cookies they provided on our first morning were a nice touch.  We would gladly book this location again."
6938542,41394076,2015-08-07,36666839,Kena,"Jonathan is an amazing host and this place was simply fantastic! The location was ideal, the space was amazingly conformable, and our stay was very enjoyable. We weren't around much because we were off site seeing, but Jonathan would checked in and even brought us a fan because of the unsusally warm weather. We especially enjoyed the little touches like two cold beers in the fridge and fresh milk for the coffee. Definitely reccomend."
6938542,41968157,2015-08-10,30173004,Arlynn,"Jonathon and Tamara were extremely nice and the in law unit was absolutely perfect. It was a great size with really cute colorful furnishings. We felt they were very thoughtful with all the added amenities-  books, apple tv, dvds, candles, etc.  The neighborhood is adorable.  "
6938542,43629762,2015-08-21,35019430,Rex And Anne,We appreciated the professionalism of the owner/manager.  The home was clean and suited all of our needs.  The reasonable summer nightly rate in a prime location in Seattle was fantastic.  We will definitely stay here again!
6938542,44149537,2015-08-24,38497160,Lindsey & Jake,"Our hosts, Jonathan & Tamara made us feel very welcome upon our arrival. They described the surrounding area and recommended some local cafes to check out, we were so thankful for their hospitality. The house is in a great location and we were able to get downtown and do all the sight-seeing we wanted within 5- 10 minutes. The neighborhood is great and there was no problem parking our car. There was a problem with the plumbing of the toilet, but I notified them about it and they took care of the same day, while we were out. No problems after that. Unfortunately with it being in a basement we did hear them walking around pretty loudly. I didn't really think about that happening (but understandable with being in a basement) I was just surprised with how loud it actually was. I would say that is the only downside about this location. Everything else was wonderful!!! "
6938542,44590690,2015-08-27,8314116,Annie,"Jonathan and Tamara were very accommodating and available anytime we needed anything.  The space was clean and had everything we needed, including an iron, which is very helpful when traveling out of a suitcase.  The only negative was that you can hear footsteps from above, but this wasn't a big issue since we were out sightseeing most of the day.  The neighborhood was very nice and convenient to downtown and other local neighborhoods as well.  We would definitely stay here again! "
6938542,44785730,2015-08-29,38227833,Helene,"The hosts made me feel welcome without being intrusive. The in-law apartment is warm and comfortable with excellent bath accessories and a perfect bed. The neighborhood is lovely and safe...I took several long walks and had no concerns. In all respects, it was a great experience."
6938542,45572471,2015-09-04,11464992,Dena,"Jonathan and Tamara were friendly and made us feel welcome in their home. The room is comfortable, the bed soft, and the heated tile floor in the bathroom was a treat for the feet.  Parking along the street is tight, but we had no problems with two cars. We enjoyed our time in Seattle and would stay here again."
6938542,46132894,2015-09-08,32084302,L,Jonathan was very cordial and helpful. We really appreciated how clean and private the room was. I especially appreciated the coffee maker and kitchen! We were able to park right in front of their home. We would definitely stay there again.
6938542,46394237,2015-09-10,19503709,Christina,We loved our stay! Jonathan was so welcoming and easy-going. He provided bikes for us to get around the city. Their location was very convenient and easy to access. The space was very comfortable and spacious. Would highly recommend staying here!
6938542,47043192,2015-09-15,747408,Ed,Jonathan was prompt with all communications prior to our arrival and we had conversations with both Jonathan and Tamara immediately after our arrival which made us comfortable at the beginning of our four day visit.
6938542,47394156,2015-09-18,42712763,Christine,It was a lovely private little area that we found most comfortable. Jonathan & Tamara were fantastic communicators before and during our stay. All of our questions were answered within the hour. The kitchen area was well equipped and there were lots of detailed options for food away from the house. The area in which the house is located is a beautiful area and we felt very safe. 
6938542,48521780,2015-09-27,38195417,Marcy,"Our hosts welcomed us upon arrival and made us feel very welcome. The accommodations were wonderful! Spacious and clean.  Jonathan and Tamara also provided nice extras like wonderful coffee and cold drinks!! Thank you so much for making our stay so pleasant!!! The availability of washer, dryer and kitchenette made moving our daughter into the university dorm so much easier! Jonathan and Tamara have done a wonderful job of equipping the unit with everything you could need and making it feel like home. They are very nice too. We enjoyed meeting them, and we will definitely return when we visit Seattle!!"
6316934,32409369,2015-05-17,22179685,Alexa,"This was my first time in Seattle and I am so glad I found Christine & this apartment! The condo exceeded our expectations and we were pleasantly surprised to find that she thought to include even the smallest things we needed, such as Tupperware to store our leftovers after cooking, laundry detergent, an iron, and more. We were close to everything we wanted to visit as well. 

Christine was incredibly helpful by answering all of my questions about the city quickly and even gave great recommendations on places to visit! We really enjoyed our time staying here."
6316934,32643366,2015-05-19,31540268,Armen,The apartment was very nice and cozy. Christine was very helpful.
6316934,32854078,2015-05-22,28480724,Alice,"We have a very good time in Seattle. The place was perfect, calm and very cute, perfect for relax after our busy day! Christine was very nice to help us before and after our trip! Definitly a good place to stay :) "
6316934,33155031,2015-05-25,22259326,Jacob,Christine and Steve were amazing hosts and accommodating to our requests. The apartment's retro  decor was awesome and the beds were comfortable. There was even Netflix and cable available in the rooms! Definitely would stay here again!
6316934,33604164,2015-05-30,32900804,Eric,"Interesting neighbors! Nice area, walkable to good food and ethical supermarkets. Right next to a bus stop. Clean, comfortable place to stay. :)"
6316934,33940435,2015-06-02,13462981,Quoc,"The hosts were very welcoming and accessible during our stay here, and as soon as we walked into the place, we loved how amazingly cute the decor was.  Although the apartment building itself is not very clean as the building's exterior/stairway smelled bad (i.e. Vagrancy), we understand that this isn't under the host's complete control.  We still enjoyed our stay very much, and the unit itself was very very clean. The foam topper on the bed also made for a very comfortable stay. If I had to be nitpicky, the Internet was quite slow compared to the many AirBnB's I have stayed at in the past. So, definitely do your online trip research ahead of time as my girlfriend and I ended up doing Yelp/TripAdvisor searches on our phones.  Also, the check-out instructions required us to strip down beds, towels, and take out the trash, which was confusing for us given the $45 cleaning fee.  Again, we've stayed at AirBnB's before, and we have never encountered such a request. 

Overall, the hosts were very helpful, the apartment was really cute, and we had a pleasant stay! 5 Stars. "
6316934,34324872,2015-06-07,19703606,Andrea,"Christine is the best host ever! She was always available to help with anything I'd might need. Answer all my questions very quick and was always concerned about how was everything going! The apartment is sooo cute! It's nice, clean, quiet...it has everything that someone might need in a stay in Seattle! I'm really a walking person, it took me around 40 minutes to walk to downtown Seattle. But, if you're not a walking person you can just go by bus, which, actually, is in your front door! Also, Christine leaves a ""book"" with everything you need to know in your stay! Don't hesitate staying at Christine's place! "
6316934,34557984,2015-06-09,24280065,Adeline,"the apartment is really cosy and homely. everything is provided, from kitchen utensils to detergent to hair dryer. the house is really clean too. I really love that place. "
6316934,34973691,2015-06-14,5940477,Alesya,"So close to everything!  Freemont PCC was 3 mins away- we hit the Sunday Freemont market- Queen Anne area is around the corner and you can walk to the Space needle if you really want! The place also comes with a parking spot!  Host was awesome and accommodating and the place is super cute and clean. Roku(Smart) TV in the bedroom is great and kitchen has all you need. We had some noisy construction on the street out front the night we got in which was rough, but not anything the host could control and she did let us know.  The only thing I might mention is thank gawd the bedroom faces away from the street! Dexter can be noisy with the windows open and there's a bus that rumbles by. Out of all the Air BnB's we have done around the world, this is by far one of the best! We enjoyed our stay and would totally come back. 
"
6316934,35807230,2015-06-22,4855815,Gna,"Spent a week plus a day in the flat. (Christine accommodated my last-minute request to arrive a day early, and late at night.) The no-host entry was appreciated. The neighborhood is pleasant and walkable with a major N-S bus route right outside the front door. I found the kitchen, bath, and other rooms well-equip with high-quality appliances and supplies.  Since I don't have it at home, the big, beautiful TV with cable and wifi added a nice bit of flare to this gal's visit! Although I was in town for several days of wedding festivities, my stay at this flat felt like a vacation--comfy, impeccably clean, and tastefully decorated. Thank you Christine! "
6316934,36024523,2015-06-24,33320210,Kara,Christine was quick to respond and sent simple instructions on how to access her flat. It was cute and as described. A very pleasant 2 mile walk to Pike's Place and downtown Seattle. Great for a young couple  looking for a place to throw their things while exploring the city.  Not baby-proof for those with toddlers! Overall good experience. 
6316934,36212438,2015-06-26,28408643,Angela,My boyfriend and I loved this space. It was a very quiet neighborhood and the apartment was so quaint and well decorated! It was very clean and it made us feel right at home. The bed was so comfortable it made it difficult to wake up in the morning! The lock box method made it easy to check in and check out. We weren't able to meet Christine but the communication was still perfect. I loved Seattle and having a nice place to stay made a huge difference. I will definitely be staying here again in the future!
6316934,36678502,2015-06-30,1833798,Whitney,"The apartment was so nicely furnished and I immediately felt comfortable with the space. Christine is a gracious host, supplying the kitchen with spices. The sheets were soft and the place was very clean. Christine was very prompt in responding to me and my concerns. I would definitely stay again! The location was lovely, so close to downtown and easily accessible to public transit. Thanks for everything! "
6316934,36876101,2015-07-02,33589760,Megan,We had a great experience - nice location and exactly what we needed.  It was very cute and comfortable for 4 people.
6316934,37164553,2015-07-05,307925,Daryl,"Christine was exceptionally accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed when we arrived. The apartment is clean, quiet, comfortable and in a great location - walking distance to the water and Fremont district. A little far for us to walk downtown with two small kids, but easy access to the bus. "
6316934,37568292,2015-07-08,16107476,Renee,"Christine's apartment was everything we needed and more. It was a short distance to downtown, easy by bus or uber. The neighborhood is also great with lake union in walking distance. The flat was super comfy with all the necessities you could need and even some little extras. Christine was great to communicate with and very friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
6316934,37707634,2015-07-09,9308689,Maria,"Christine's apartment was easy to find and a short drive to downtown Seattle. Communication with her was easy! Her apart was beautifully decorated, a twist of modern and vintage. My boyfriends parents found the bedroom really comfortable and we found the couch large and comfortable up sleep on. The apartment was really clean and we had a great stay. "
6316934,38121809,2015-07-13,13264596,Justin,"The place was comfortable and clean, not to mention that Christine was incredibly communicative before my parents arrived at her flat. "
6316934,38395201,2015-07-15,34196549,Gianluca,"This was an excellent lodging: the apartment was great, very functional and well decorated, and near to everything, mainly by car. "
6316934,39006160,2015-07-20,16115226,Steven,"Very nice, comfortable spot in a super convenient location. Christine was a wonderful host, and made herself available for any questions. We would definitely stay again."
6316934,39616606,2015-07-25,21581034,Âµò,"This is a comfortable and cozy apartment with very nice room decorations. It's about 10 minutes to downtown by bus, and about 5 minutes to a small supermarket by foot. An unforgettable experience!"
6316934,40095024,2015-07-28,7860373,Jamie,"Across the board, we appreciated the attention to detail at this Seattle flat. The decor was fun, the area info in the super-organized notebook left for guests was a truly useful guide, and Christine's directions were far better than Siri :) Location is perfect for a walk to Fremont or buses to downtown. I definitely recommend."
6316934,40334693,2015-07-30,17841919,Chris,"Unfortunately, we hit Seattle during a heat wave and this apartment doesn't have air conditioning (I would imagine most Airbnb apartments in the area are the same way). Fans were supplied, but were ineffective. The only way to cool the apartment at night was to leave the windows open. Since the apartment was located on a relatively major thoroughfare, this made it kind of noisy at night and the combination made for a somewhat uncomfortable stay. The apartment was in easy reach of all the Seattle attractions and was well-equipped. The hostess answered all our messages very quickly. However, if I were to book another Seattle stay during the summer, I would make sure the accommodations were air-conditioned."
6316934,40582508,2015-08-01,33295390,Till,Very cute apartment. Good communications (we either walked or took the bus downtown). Comfortable bed as well as sleeping coach. Use of laundry machine is a big plus as well!
6316934,41206715,2015-08-05,4283721,Massimo,"We enjoyed Christine's apartment very much. The place is clean, comfortable and close to all the main areas of town. Our host was kind and accommodating, we truly felt at home. Thank you Christina."
6316934,42673386,2015-08-15,180526,Len,"The apartment is clean and nicely furnished with all the appropriate amenities.  We enjoyed a comfortable stay there.  Part of the purpose of the trip was bringing our Grandson to Seattle to enroll at Seattle Pacific University, which is an easy 5 minute drive from the apartment.  We enjoyed the proximity to Queen Anne and Fremont area shops and restaurants.  Excellent location.  Will return when we are in the area."
6316934,43412221,2015-08-19,39852466,Rick,"What a nice place to ""flop"" after a days activities in Seattle, Fremont/Ballard or wherever. Our host was kind and thoughtful considering this was a special stay on a road-trip for our 35th Anniversary. 
All accommodations have been well thought out and everything we needed was there. Very clean and inviting!"
6316934,44351768,2015-08-25,40756467,Carolina,"We love the apartment, despite we are a family of 4, it was very comfy. And the decoration beautiful, love the cameras :) Its is great located, blocks from downtown, and from union lake. We left so much to do. We surely going back to Seattle soon. Thanks"
6316934,45368776,2015-09-02,32926267,Elaine,"My family met up from different parts of the globe to be in Seattle.  Christine's place was brilliant.  It was clean with a great shower and a comfortable bed together with a great pull out for my girls.  The area is very nice and well located.  We loved Seattle and really enjoyed coming home to our cozy, clean apartment.
Thank you so much Christine.
Bet wishes
Elaine Jobling"
6316934,45571797,2015-09-04,12849625,Cheryl,The apartment was everything we were hoping for.  Very well appointed with everything we might need during our stay.  Very comfortable beds which are so important to enjoy busy days!  We only wished we had brought our bikes as it is perfectly located to explore all of downtown by bike!
6316934,45939194,2015-09-07,15244697,Thom,"Christine's flat was perfect for a quick family vacation in Seattle this past Labour Day long weekend. Her flat was clean, and tastefully decorated. Parking was convenient and location was indeed a short commute to it all, and even walkable if you're up for it. Booking was a breeze and great communication throughout! Would book again if the occasion arises. "
6316934,46333809,2015-09-09,42957742,Annie,"This apartment really was central to everything. 

It's a cute, small place in a little apartment complex, easy to find and access, with convenient parking. The laundry room was a huge bonus. Queen bed in the bedroom, comfy pull out in the living room. It was also nice to have all the kitchen amenities handy to do some cooking in.

It's so close to everything! We got to do all of our favorite things in Seattle: hike, paddle on Lake Washington and Lake Union, visit the Sound, and poke around downtown, and we never drove more than 20 min. Great place to stay."
6316934,47132460,2015-09-15,43966125,Kevin,"This place was exactly as advertised. Clean, comfortable, and just a stone's throw from some Seattle's best neighborhoods. We loved our stay here! Definitely worth the price. This is a legitimate place in a great area of Seattle. Thanks, Christine!"
6316934,47816121,2015-09-21,6154165,Monique,"Lovely apartment, nicely decorated, very conveniently located, worked well for 4 guests. Was a great place to stay in Seattle while visiting friends!"
6316934,48048415,2015-09-22,44391845,Lindsay,"Christine was a fantastic, well organized and hospitable host. Her place was so cute. We had everything we could have possibly needed at our disposal, and we were very centrally located for our purposes. This was our first airbnb experience, and it could not have been more perfect.

Thanks, Christine!"
6316934,48313170,2015-09-25,43142304,Char,"Christine was quick to respond to my questions. There were four of us staying at Christine's place so we used both the queen bed and the sofa-bed. The sofa-bed was surprisingly very comfortable. We didn't use the public transportation during our stay, but the bus stop was just across the street. Downtown was about a 10 min drives by car. There were plenty of towels and blankets for us to use. Thanks!"
6316934,48868443,2015-09-29,35814689,Dirk,"Wir hatten das Appartment im September f√ºr unseren Seattle Aufenthalt gebucht und waren vollends zufrieden.
Die Ausstattung der Wohnung ist hervorragend und bietet wirklich alles was man ben√∂tigt, um auch mal selber zu kochen.

Das Appartment ist richtig gem√ºtlich und eine tolle Abwechslung nach den vielen Motels und Hotels die man auf einem USA Rundtrip so bewohnt. Hier kann man sich wohl f√ºhlen und auch mal zur Ruhe kommen.

Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch super. Man kann zwar nicht wirklich irgend etwas von dort aus ""erlaufen"" aber die gegend ist sch√∂n und sowohl am Wochenende als auch unter der Woche verkehrsm√§√üig echt entspannt. Wir sind von dort aus mi t dem Auto immer schnell da hin gekommen wo wir hin wollten. Der kostenlose Parkplatz hinterm Haus ist nat√ºrlich auch goldwert. Bushaltestelle ist tats√§chlich direkt vor der T√ºr haben wir aber nicht genutzt. Leihfahrr√§der sind auch in der Stra√üe, hat sich f√ºr uns aber nicht ergeben und um dort hin zu laufen ist es evtl. auch ein wenig zu weit.

Wir w√ºrden die Wohnung auf jeden Fall wieder buchen, beim n√§chsten Besuch der Stadt."
6316934,49075226,2015-09-30,12934633,Ryan,"Christine's place was perfect for my 1 day stay in Seattle.  Great location, central to all major Seattle neighborhoods.

Although the building is a little bit older on the outside, the apartment is very modern and well appointed on the inside.  Very clean with everything you need.  The bed was SUPER comfortable!  

Easy entry with a lock box and Christine communicated well.  I highly recommend staying here if you are in Seattle for work or play."
6316934,50810259,2015-10-14,22242296,Erin,Host was SO helpful and accessible. She worked with me on arranging for an earlier check-in time and the whole process was seamless and easy. The location really was great too. Five minutes by car to a great natural grocery store and just a few more minutes to get downtown or to some of the other great Chicago neighborhoods. Accommodations were very comfortable and just as described. We very much enjoyed our stay!
6316934,51204605,2015-10-18,1583877,Danny,"I would definitely stay here again if I found myself in this part of town. The apartment was exactly as advertised, cute and comfortable. My daughter really wants a vintage typewriter now. The location, between Downtown and the Fremont neighborhood, is a good jumping off point for exploring different parts of the city--and you can easily jog down to the lake from there. My one quibble is that there weren't more coffee shops and restaurants in the area immediately around the apartment--something I would have expected in an urban neighborhood of that sort. (Starbucks is about a half mile away, so my caffeine needs didn't go unmet.)
"
6316934,52951609,2015-11-02,44507743,Christina,"This place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. What it lacked it square footage, it more than made up for in character and convenience. Getting downtown took only a few minutes, and its proximity to tons of amazing restaurants, bars, and shops, was perfect. Having a designated parking spot (it's the back left one in the lot behind the building) was a perk as well! The busy street its on is pretty noisy, so if you sleep with the windows open expect to hear lots of traffic, morning busses, and frequent activity during the night, but hopefully you spent the day enjoying the city and are exhausted by the time return for the night so won't care. Price is right, too! Thanks, Christine!"
6316934,53579422,2015-11-09,22157,Keya,"We loved staying at Christine's lovely apartment in Seattle. The place was spacious, in a great location close to everything and had a really comfortable bed. The apartment has been decorated with great care, the kitchen is fully equipped to cook, make coffee etc. and we loved the local guides, maps and train schedules that were super helpful when we planned our day. There were a few Car2Go's close to the house so it was super easy to get around. Plus the apartment is only a 10-min Uber ride to downtown and all the best neighborhoods and restaurants. Also loved that Christine was really communicative, answered all our questions and was able to accommodate a really late check-in. There was also plenty of closet space and empty drawers for us to unpack our things etc. She really did think of everything to make our stay comfortable."
6316934,53866953,2015-11-13,9265699,Gabrielle,"Lovely accommodations, great for four people, relatively central. "
6316934,54174268,2015-11-16,3125873,Elizabeth,Had a wonderful weekend at Christine's lovely apartment. Just perfect for a girls trip. Christine was very attentive and though we didn't meet her she checked in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed!
6316934,54534789,2015-11-21,48339620,Sarah,Christine was very friendly and thorough via e-mail. The apartment had all we needed for our stay and we appreciate your hospitality Christine!
6316934,55272129,2015-11-29,22964408,Marc,The apartment is well equipped and convenient. Thanks to the fast buses and the stop just one minute away our car stayed in the reserved spot for the whole week-end. Christine and Steve were very helpful and responsive. Traffic can sometimes be a bit noisy in the living room during the day but it didn't bother us at night time; while close to the city center the neighborhood is residential and quiet. (The bedroom is on the other side of the building.) The sofa bed is way above average and comfortable either way. Overall a great and recommended base for discovering Seattle.
6316934,55675717,2015-12-04,48941838,Xiaoqi,great stay in seattle!
6316934,55751488,2015-12-05,13448658,Auzeen,Christine was very helpful and her place was adorable. Such a great location to hit up some of Seattle's most fun neighborhoods. I would definitely recommend and stay here in the future!
6316934,56134044,2015-12-09,3712793,Carmeli,"The apartment was very cozy and comfortable. Christine was amazing, I mentioned that we have an infant and she went above & beyond to accommodate us. If we're going to Seattle again, will definitely get one of her property. "
6316934,56345556,2015-12-12,50610891,Hanh,"The listing was exactly as described...definitely a cute, clean, cozy apartment in a convenient location. I only wish I could have stayed longer.  It was great to come back to a homey place after spending all day exploring Seattle."
6316934,56889761,2015-12-19,51182601,Genevieve,"My family and I had a wonderful time at Christine's place. She was very quick responding to my emails. The place was very comfortable, homy and welcoming. After 4 weeks on the roads, being able to cooking our meals with all the utensils was a treat. 
Thanks Christine!"
6316934,57154669,2015-12-22,314976,Sandy,Christine is a great host. Always there to help and sort out things quickly. The flat is exactly as the pictures shown. We enjoyed our stay! 
6316934,57454075,2015-12-26,27973047,Veronica,We stayed in the apartment over the Christmas Holiday and had a great experience. The location is excellent and the kitchen was very well equipped and perfect for cooking our Christmas dinner!

3146212,15929336,2014-07-18,11164510,Briahnna,Richard and Jeri's place was so lovely! They are great hosts and super helpful with everything. If I stay in Seattle again I would definitely revisit!
3146212,16137653,2014-07-22,7811783,Huw,"We had a great time staying with Richard and Jeri. They responded quickly to emails, sent us helpful information about transportation, and were there to show us around the apartment and make us feel welcome.

The house is within walking distance of UW, and there are also nearby buses to the U-District and Downtown. It is in a pretty, quiet residential street, but is also (conveniently) quite near some main roads. We loved the apartment itself: it was spacious, well furnished (full kitchen, comfy chairs and couch) and very clean. Richard and Jeri also left us some fruit and breakfast food, which we really appreciated! Richard and Jeri are great hosts, and staying with them was an excellent way to see Seattle."
3146212,16225144,2014-07-23,13316614,Dana,"Richard & Jeri are amazing, I felt like I was visiting family! Very welcoming, and accommodating and great with communication. The space is great, very clean, and exactly what is posted. I would love to stay again and spend some time in their gorgeous garden! Free street parking."
3146212,16316255,2014-07-25,100532,Mary,"Richard and Jeri were excellent hosts. We were very pleased with their lovely apartment. It was very neat, clean and comfortable. The purpose for our stay was to ""get away"" and escape the daily grind, and Richard and Jeri's place allowed us to do just that! The apartment was well appointed with all the basics, and it was very quiet and peaceful.  They provide access to a huge variety of reading material, games, media, and even some snack foods! As luck would have it...the raspberries in their lovely garden were ripe and generously available.  Their place offers easy access to the swanky University Village, where a live band was playing in an open-air venue on the night of our stay.  We would definitely stay here again. If you are considering a great private space with wonderful hosts, Richard and Jeri's place won't disappoint!"
3146212,16624827,2014-07-30,17655338,Nick,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Richard and Jeri were terrific hosts: they provided us with excellent directions, met us at the door when we arrived, and were attentive and accommodating in every way during our stay. The apartment was lovely: spacious, comfortable, well-equipped, and spotlessly clean. The neighborhood was fun to walk in, with a number of good restaurants and an excellent grocery store. The location is great: two blocks from a bus stop, and convenient to both the University district and downtown. We look forward to returning when our travels take us to Seattle. Highly recommended!"
3146212,16738164,2014-08-01,9269608,James,Richard and Jeri were so gracious during my stay and communicative leading up to the trip. The rental was perfect and very comfortable. I would definitely come back here again just to read in the garden. 
3146212,16927806,2014-08-04,3219746,Sarah,My parents had a great stay at Richard and Jeri's air bnb apartment. Our nearby house is too small to host all the family who came in for our daughters first birthday party. Richard and Jeri's place is on a quiet street in the neighborhood. The garden is beautiful and my parents felt like welcomed guests in their home. 
3146212,17166891,2014-08-08,5656939,Casey,"This was perfect for my wife and I. Near to U dub and Greenlake, quiet, wonderful garden setting. Richard and Jeri made sure we had some morning essentials (read: coffee) and snacks to get you started in the morning. The apartment was very nice, very well appointed and super comfortable. Highly recommend this listing for couples or singles. "
3146212,17372277,2014-08-11,17983489,Joshua,"The accommodations were absolutely amazing. I had friends coming in from San Diego and set them up with the space Richard and Jeri had, and it was more then I could have hoped for. The basement unit meant that it was cool in this hot summer we've been having, there was room to relax, and a back yard that was very welcoming. It was actually bigger then I was thinking, it exceeded my expectations. Richard and Jeri were excellent hosts, very hospitable. My friends who stayed there were very pleased and comfprtable and impressed. Thanks Richard and Jeri!!"
3146212,17853489,2014-08-18,13775993,Kim,"Arriving at Richard and Jeri's was like checking into a little oasis in a wonderful family neighborhood.  Jeri went out of her way and even took me to the grocery store to do some shopping, as I didn't have a car.  I was in town to attend an Instructor course that was in walking distance.  The apartment is so comfortable, quiet and relaxing.  After long days in session, I just wanted to study, read and kick back.  At this wonderful apartment, it felt just like home.  The backyard is a wonderful wooded escape with a fountain, bbq and lovely flora.  This was a fantastic stay - I had everything I needed and more!  Thanks to Richard and Jeri - it was great to meet you and your hospitality was perfect!"
3146212,18333930,2014-08-25,13221714,Katie,This place was perfect! Jeri and Richard have thought of everything and provided us with everything we could want.  Plenty of space (with the whole basement as living space) and privacy make this location a great deal and a unique and cozy place to stay in Seattle. Very close to the University of Washington and plenty of restaurants. 
3146212,18552438,2014-08-28,13710406,Clare,"Richard and Jeri were most gracious and, had this been a leisure trip, I would have enjoyed visiting more with them in their gorgeous backyard garden. The space they've designed for their guests is delightful - lovely kitchen, comfortable dining/living area and great bed and bath. They were also kind of enough to leave lots of little thoughtful touches around the room - from in-season peaches and plums to a dish of delectable chocolates. Most definitely on my ""I'll be back"" list for Seattle!
"
3146212,18888546,2014-09-02,18478473,Barbara,"Jeri and Richard were warm and welcoming upon our arrival. They gave us complete instructions for the use of their apartment, and we felt very comfortable while we were there. In fact, we thought they went above and beyond by providing snacks and breakfast essentials for guests. Everything was exactly as promised, and we would not hesitate to refer them to others, and we hope to use their apartment again in the future."
3146212,19218072,2014-09-08,2124674,Lise,"Perfect place to stay. Richard and Jeri were perfect hosts. I was visiting with my three girls and the apartment was more than I could ask for. Private, fresh fruit, beautiful backyard...it was delightful."
3146212,19540305,2014-09-14,20181915,Anna,"Jeri and Richard were excellent hosts. They were really helpful and understanding in efforts to find an apartment in Seattle since we just moved here.

The space is great with really nice decorating details. The kitchen works well for staying there for a week or so and being able to stay in a few nights. The neighborhood is very residential and safe. There are very convenient bus lines to get downtown or anywhere else in the city only a block away from the house."
3146212,19805863,2014-09-18,20181915,Anna,Full review on the extension.
3146212,19880306,2014-09-20,19647644,Steven,"Jeri and Richard were excellent hosts. Before our arrival, communication was excellent. After our arrival, my wife and I had an enjoyable chat with Richard. We found the space to be fabulous and convenient to University of Washington, which our son attends."
3146212,20557915,2014-10-01,5885920,Terri,"I had a beautiful stay of 4 nights at this apartment. Clean, quiet, safe, comfortable, and a good value. Lovely back yard to enjoy when the weather's nice. Jeri and Richard are v. responsive and have created an inviting place with many nice touches and a fully equipped kitchen. "
3146212,21143700,2014-10-12,12607621,Steve,"This was a really pleasant experience. Richard met me when I arrived and showed me around the place. It was clean, spacious, and well appointed. I had undisturbed privacy and because I was in and out a lot, I barely saw Richard and never ran into Jeri. This facet didn't bother me, and I hope they were OK with it as well. Richard seemed very sweet. They included an iron and ironing board that I asked for, and that was great. I really didn't lack for anything here.

This neighborhood was a bit sleepier and more calm than I probably wanted, but I also knew that when I chose it. There certainly were benefits to it (parking! quiet!) and this has nothing to do with the quality or value of the apartment in general. It's just one small complaint about my visit. But given that I was driving around a lot, the easy parking was really crucial.

Anyway, this is a solid place to spend a few days.

"
3146212,21612271,2014-10-20,21944798,Nam,"Richard and Jeri were very welcoming hosts and made sure to come by and show me the details of how the apartment worked and to let me know of all of its amenities. They live upstairs but they aren't too intrusive. They always texted first to see when was a good time to come by. My son accidently broke a floor lamp and they were super gracious about it and helped clean up, which I consider above and beyond hosting duties. 

The place is actually nicer than the photos. It is more spacious and the details of the kitchen especially appear better in real life than in the photos. The garden is as lovely as described. As mentioned, the hosts live upstairs so you can pretty loudly hear people moving around and muffled voices when they are home, which might bother some people, but I was ok with it.  Just something to be aware of. I would definitely recommend staying here.

Richard and Jeri also had coffee, fresh fruit, and snacks available when I came in, which I think was a very nice and welcoming touch. Very thoughtful hosts."
3146212,22258698,2014-11-02,22175854,Victoria,"I spent the weekend staying in Richard and Jeri's gorgeous apartment for a reunion during the Halloween weekend. The space was quiet, comfortable, and large enough to host guests for meals. 

 While I did not need much help familiarizing myself with the area ( I went to school there), they were on call 24/7 to answer any questions. I highly recommend that you give Richard and Jeri a chance to impress you. :)"
3146212,22598899,2014-11-10,17383409,Kathy,The apartment is bigger than it appears in the pictures. It is decorated very nicely and was very comfortable. It is located on a quiet street that is easy to get to anywhere you may want to go. Richard & Jeri were very helpful both before and during our stay. 
3146212,23906702,2014-12-14,1887787,Dorrinda,"Richard and Jeri are everything you could hope for in a host. Although I only stayed a couple of nights I found them to be communicative, happy to meet people with warm smiles, and have a well thought-out design detailed space that is so welcoming. I like that you're tucked away in a cozy neighborhood with a sense of hiding away, but also have a great well-lit space near some of the hustle & bustle of 65th & Roosevelt. 
This private apartment was perfect for me to visit the local events and be in bed 10 minutes later.
As mentioned, I love the details...not only aesthetically pleasing design in the space, but coffee AND tea, fruit AND bars as snacks + some condiments in the fridge. You feel very nurtured in their space. 
Another feeling of ""being taken care of"" was the attention to emergency exits and accessible first aid kit.
I'll definitely visit again :D"
3146212,24662760,2015-01-01,13710406,Clare,"A very clean, comfortable, spacious, safe and welcoming respite close to the University District. Jeri and Richard are thoughtful hosts and ensure their guests enjoy fresh fruit, healthy snacks, and locally roasted coffee. Many good reasons I'm a repeat customer and will continue to be. "
3146212,26138354,2015-02-04,1606067,Paul,Really nice apartment in Richard & Jerri's house. Modern and clean with all the amenities including a gas fireplace. They left a lot of goodies for us and were super accommodating and really nice people. 
3146212,26255400,2015-02-08,18478473,Barbara,"This was our second stay at Richard and Jeri's home, and it was as perfect this time as it was the first time we stayed. Richard greeted us and gave us a quick review of things in the apartment. While we knew they were easily accessible, they are also very discreet so we never felt them hovering over us. The location of their home is perfect for our needs, so I'm sure we'll stay with them again for future visits. I would definitely recommend their home to other visitors. "
3146212,26678935,2015-02-17,25264269,Lisa,"I always love visiting Seattle but my recent visit was probably the best yet, due to the convenience and comfort of this Ravenna apartment."
3146212,27737779,2015-03-10,11406671,Ryan,"Richard and Jeri were thoughtful & welcoming hosts and the apartment was fantastic. Lots of nice touches around the apartment made it a pleasure to stay in, and Richard was available any time I needed help. The garden out back is nice and the location is great - within easy walking/bus distance of the University District. Can't recommend this place enough!"
3146212,28057827,2015-03-16,29182985,Janaki,"I booked Richard and Jeri's place at the last minute on behalf of my parents- and brother-in-law who were coming into town unexpectedly. Richard and Jeri were very prompt and accomodating in terms of making the reservation even just the night before. According to my family, Richard and Jeri were wonderful hosts, their home was lovely, and the back yard was absolutely beautiful. I will definitely be checking here first for availability next time my family is in town. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"
3146212,29745173,2015-04-12,28075555,Anne,"We loved staying at this Ravenna apartment! It was private, quiet, cosy & very close to the extended family we were visiting. The hosts made it easy to come and go, provided breakfast & snack basics and were very helpful in orienting us to the space. Pictures were accurate, the garden is gorgeous & we hope to be able to stay here again - everything was great for me & my 2 teenagers."
3146212,30223904,2015-04-19,3614124,Virginia,"Jeri welcomed me when I arrived and showed me all the details of the apartment. The apartment is even cuter than in the photos and there were many thoughtful touches, including fruit on the dining room, local chocolates, and energy bars. The kitchen was great. I felt welcomed and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and a nice place to walk in."
3146212,31191305,2015-05-03,4006645,Christopher,"Great about arranging arrival times, everything you need was there - good internet connection, directions on how to get everywhere, basic kitchen equipment just fine.   Easy to come and go, parking near by, I hardly saw them in the two weeks I was there but had everything I needed."
3146212,31924530,2015-05-11,20454314,Patrick,The Hosts were very welcoming and caring. 
3146212,32913375,2015-05-23,32188173,Ayanle,Richard and Jerri were very accomdating and open. The space was very spacious and relaxing. The neighbor was quiet yet friendly. 
3146212,35765813,2015-06-22,22339978,Alexi,"Richard and Jeri welcomed us right away with their warm personalities. Shortly after we arrived, Jeri went above and beyond by taking us to the grocery store and explaining the nearby attractions. The pictures are very accurate and the place was very neat and clean. They had an array of complimentary snack foods waiting for us to use. We were staying for an entire month and couldn't have been happier to have chosen this apartment to stay in.  The backyard was an amazing little inner city oasis. I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend Richard and Jeri as hosts!"
3146212,36529659,2015-06-29,32012128,Gary,"Richard and Jeri welcomed us, having taken initiative to message us before we arrived.  Very warm, helpful and accommodating.   They were only present for times when we needed something but assured us that they would respond to anything we needed.  We had only one small detail with a towel rack which Richard fixed immediately.    

A great balance of presence and privacy."
3146212,37640667,2015-07-09,29395968,Joseph,"What a great apartment -very clean and neat.  Our hosts were great. 
They greeted us very friendly and showed us around  They even had a stocked frig (milk, butter etc) for our use. Also the kitchen was complete and ready for use.
The bed (double) was a little small for two people so I slept on the pull out sofa bed which was comfortable."
3146212,40101854,2015-07-28,27602122,Silke,Richard and Jeri were perfectly organized. Theo contacted US in advance to help US finden the way and everything we needed. Good balance between privacy and contacted. We traveled with our Baby Boy and the were very open and cared about US. The plane was perfect and as discribed in the anouncement. Good starting point for seattle sightsighing. For us a very nice and cosy plane to stay.
3146212,41320417,2015-08-07,17369903,Melanie,"I enjoyed my stay at the Ravenna apartment very much.  Richard and Jeri were very warm and welcoming upon my arrival and remained friendly and helpful throughout my stay.  The apartment itself was well appointed and comfortable.  There were many little extra's that made the accommodations special, such as popcorn, coffee creamer, and chocolates, all of which was unexpected but greatly appreciated. I would enjoy staying at this lovely, quiet and private location when in the Seattle area in the future.
"
3146212,42261667,2015-08-12,210152,Carol,"We were so comfortable for our whole stay, and felt so kindly welcomed by Richard and Jeri that I'm already recommending this to friends planning a visit for next month. Not only is the space very attractive and roomy, but very well-designed and well-stocked. There were even coffee and other treats and essentials available, so we could settle in without shopping immediately. The backyard was lovely, and a very nice neighborhood. Easy access to UW and busses to downtown or beyond. "
3146212,43481926,2015-08-20,30452875,Eileen,"My hosts were delightful.  The listing was better than the pictures led me to believe.  There is not a picture of the couch and fireplace.  The house is in a very good neighborhood, that is quiet and well located.  I felt safe and secure."
3146212,44347489,2015-08-25,2473183,Aaron,"Staying with Richard and Jeri was fantastic. The accommodation itself was perfect for our small group of four; it was clean, comfortable and well equipt with all the basics we needed accessible to us. 

The cherry on top though was our hosts, Richard and Jeri who were absolute gold. Easy to chat to, friendly and warm. Richard also was a saviour when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the bathroom! Absolute legend!! 

Thanks so much for a wonderful stay in Seattle."
3146212,46737653,2015-09-13,40205492,Ben,"A great experience. Not only was the apartment amazing, Richard and Jeri were very nice.

3146212,48738962,2015-09-28,30149127,Jocie,We loved our stay here. Jeri and Richard greeted us warmly and could not have been more welcoming and informative. The neighborhood was lovely and the location worked very well for us. The kitchen and living room were well-appointed and the bed very comfortable. We certainly hope to be back. 
3146212,49593397,2015-10-05,29297625,Nancy,"For my first Airbnb experience, this was a winner! Richard & Jeri were so friendly & welcoming and their apartment was perfect! Plenty of room, comfortable furniture, great bed, a cozy fireplace, nice kitchen with lots of spices & condiments. They left a bowl of chocolates, fruit, microwave popcorn & granola bars, milk in the fridge, cereal in the cupboard. I really felt comfortable & safe there. Electronic keypad so you didn't have to worry about a key. A beautiful backyard to hang out in. I had a perfect stay & will definitely be back!!"

3146212,51617921,2015-10-22,6543103,ƒêorƒëe,"The house is as great and cute as you can possibly imagine based on the photos, and even much better. It occupies the most beautiful hidden spot of a peaceful, yet well-connected neighborhood. You will have a romantic fireplace and a classy green backyard. But that is all unimportant. The best selling point is actually Richard & Jeri -- truly wonderful, positive, and inspiring people, pioneers of climate activism and environmental TV stars! I was honored to have such profound and important discussion with them. I just wish this world had more people like Richard & Jeri!  Please don't miss the opportunity to talk to them during your stay."
3146212,52507162,2015-10-30,45097954,Dan,Richard and Jeri are great hosts and the accommodations were perfect. Nice quiet neighborhood and I plan on staying here again on future trips to Seattle. I highly recommend this location!

3146212,57463462,2015-12-26,50481109,Charles,"This location is a real gem.  The accommodations are incredibly well maintained and very homey.  Beyond being affable hosts, Jeri and Richard have thought of every detail to make our stay comfortable.  The fireplace and efficient kitchen are a real bonus.  Better than any hotel.  Highly recommended."
8474584,49076064,2015-09-30,45093297,Clayton,Great experience!  Place was exactly as advertised.  10 minutes by bus to downtown.  Sonny was very prompt and helpful.  Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Seattle.
8474584,53185787,2015-11-06,24270386,Michelle,"Sonny was a great host. The apartment was beautiful and everything described. Anytime we had any issues, Sonny was just a text away and super responsive. I would recommend his listing to anyone visiting Seattle with a need for a comfortable, large space to stay. "
3120652,15501201,2014-07-10,16741801,Mauro,"Our stay was fantastic. The house is close to parks, perfect for morning walks, less than 15 minute walk to the lite rail station (and about 5 minutes from the bus stop), a couple of minutes walk to a Walgreens and restaurants.  The house is itself was clean, comfortable, and in great condition. Thank you so much to Carolyn as well for her hospitality throughout our stay. Even prior to our arrival, she was very helpful in answering questions about transportation and the area.  Our 6 day trip to Seattle was outstanding and that is due, in no small part, to our ""home"" during our visit!"
3120652,15603837,2014-07-12,17612938,Jean,"Great location: Easy access to downtown, near a playground and park, easy walking to shops and restaurants.
Cute 2 bedroom home."
3120652,16237885,2014-07-23,18470794,Lucy,"The host was great.  She left the house clean and all communication from her was clear and accurate.  When we first pulled up to the house, we were a bit concerned that the neighborhood was not charming, but when we had a chance to drive around we realized that the house sits on the edge of a very interesting and fun neighborhood.  There is a street not too far away with a two block stretch of great restaurants and shops, and Lake Washington is not many blocks in the other direction.  "
3120652,16722487,2014-08-01,213943,Jimmy,carolyn was very gracious and accommodating and we just loved staying in her beautiful home. the location is great; making it a snap to get around. we were sad having to leave.
3120652,17032648,2014-08-05,13112041,Patrick,"This is great quiet place to stay just outside of downtown Seattle. You can find yourself in downtown under 10 min. driving time.  Her place is supper clean and the sleeping accommodations were very comfortable. Plenty of places to eat around her house. Monday mornings most of them are closed so make sure you go to Columbia City Bakery for their awesome ham and cheese croissants! We were only able to stay 1 night because of traveling, but would defiantly stay again. "
3120652,17084865,2014-08-06,19414218,Ryan,Carolyn's place was a great spot to stay at for our trip to Seattle. Great home that was more than enough for 2 people. Carolyn was very easy to talk to and was quick to respond. Would definitely recommend this place if you are planning to travel to Seattle.
3120652,17532811,2014-08-13,5352170,Jacqueline,"Great stay!  Carolyn was very responsive to emails, provided great information in the confirmation (and in hard copy on arrival) and was flexible with arrival times.  The space was comfortable, clean and perfectly met our needs - free parking on the street, walkable to the Link, local shops and restaurants within walking distance, backyard with shade and BBQ.  Would definitely recommend/use again.  Thank you!"
3120652,17689582,2014-08-16,5061107,Patrick,"My wife & I and our two teenaged kids enjoyed our stay at this lovely little home very much. Although the house is small, we all found comfortable sleeping arrangements. The house is very well located to downtown with convenient public transportation. Carolyn was very responsive to our inquiries."
3120652,17892698,2014-08-18,11390504,Jon,"Carolyn was super prompt in all of her communication.  Her house is great, my sons really enjoyed the fenced in back yard. An extra bonus is the house's proximity to a park with some AMAZING playgrounds!"
3120652,18145965,2014-08-22,18881667,Natalie,Cute little home in a nice neighborhood. Had a very enjoyable stay and would stay again! Thanks for making our Seattle trip comfortable.
3120652,18418913,2014-08-26,6492072,New,"Very enjoyable time at this residency. Was kept clean and had everything we needed. Great location, and next to a huge park and a nearby Walgreens. Will definitely recommend anyone who goes to Seattle."
3120652,18535528,2014-08-28,16869447,Amanda,"Carolyn always responded immediately to every enquiry, and her home was charming and so comfortable. It was close to everything we wanted to see and do!"
3120652,18888036,2014-09-02,14553267,Jeff,Carolyn was an awesome host who was not only super prompt at getting back to us and also super accommodating. The house is great and in a quiet neighborhood. I'd absolutely recommend staying here. 
3120652,19697154,2014-09-16,3972608,Anna,"My husband and I just enjoyed a lovely stay at Carolyn's Columbia City home. It was a perfect set up for us, we felt right at home. Carolyn made check-in and check-out very easy and was pleasant and easy to reach. The interior of the house is beautifully decorated. We highly recommend this Airbnb rental."
3120652,20354521,2014-09-28,1001726,Debra,"Carol's place in Columbia City was an absolute gem. If you don't need super-fast access to downtown (and who does, really?), we can absolutely recommend this quiet, serene abode.

Check-in was effortless, and this was really beneficial after completing a 10-hour trans-Atlantic flight! The bed was comfortable and the living room was a nice place to relax after a day taking care of business. The Internet was plenty fast and the backyard - which we did not see nearly enough of - was the ultimate in tranquility.

Carol has a treasure in this place and we definitely consider it one of our go-to spaces when we visit Seattle."
3120652,20480259,2014-09-29,19792279,GeeSeung,the owner of this house would prepare all of things such as equipment to cook with. anyway we were enjoying traveling and taking a rest there!
3120652,20844029,2014-10-06,21146392,Michael,"The house was beautiful and very well equipped. We had plenty of space and enjoyed our stay. Carolyn was flexible with check-in times which really helped us. We really enjoyed the outdoor area and there was a great park close by.

We had some interesting interactions with some folks from the neighbourhood, but nothing that made us feel unwelcome."
3120652,21763881,2014-10-23,22509635,Kelleen,"This listing was fabulous. I like hotels just as much as the next person but being out of the big city was pleasant. Any questions I had were answered in a timely fashion, everything is very cheque and clean. The location was perfect and a large fenced backyard made for a great picnic area. "
3120652,22679821,2014-11-11,23126439,Marianna,"Carolyn was a wonderful hostess. Her home was exactly as advertised. Very clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. She was extremely welcoming and generous with her accommodations. My trip to Seattle was fantastic, and in large part this can be credited to my decision to stay at Carolyn's ""Cozy 2 Bedroom Columbia City"" home.  "
3120652,24901008,2015-01-03,9171440,Katie,This home was a great place to stay...  The neighbourhood was so cute with an old charm feel.  Literally 5 mins walk to amazing cafe's and pubs and this cute little old picture theatre.  About 10-15mins walk to the light rail (it's up hill so helps to work off those extra holiday calories).  It's so cheap and convenient and takes you right downtown in less than 10minutes 
3120652,25566866,2015-01-19,14050371,Jeff,A very clean and comfortable house!  Carolyn was easy to contact and very accomodating!  We did not have a car and she offered us a ride to the Light Rail station.  An excellent host!  Thanks!
3120652,27431413,2015-03-04,17403098,Laura,"Carolyn's cozy cottage was exactly as described. Comfortable and well organized, with a terrific location. A brisk walk to our favorite bakery. Parking was easy and the neighborhood was quiet.  When our granddaughter came to visit she enjoyed playing at the park located down the street. Thank you Carolyn. "
3120652,28170873,2015-03-19,27755328,Greg,"My friends and I had a wonderful time at the Columbia city home. It was just as expected, with very nice neighborhood. Caroline was great to deal with as well. Quick responses to all forms of contact prior to and during our stay."
3120652,28740890,2015-03-29,1499027,James,"Carolyn's home was perfect for our little Seattle getaway. The neighborhood (Columbia City) is fantastic and literally everything the neighborhood has to offer is an easy walk from the property (food, coffee, bars, light rail etc). My wife and I had our young daughters so the Genesse Playground .5 blocks away was a great amenity. The house itself was super cute, neatly decorated and most of all comfortable. The immediate neighborhood is quiet and safe. We would love to stay here again and recommend this home to anyone interested in visiting Seattle. "
3120652,29664182,2015-04-11,27167450,Carolyne,"My niece and I stayed here while visiting colleges.  And we couldn't have picked a better place!  Across from a park, close to transportation and being the Columbia City area...great restaurants!  We loved being close to a grocery store too and made all our breakfasts as well.  Excellent choice if going to Seattle."
3120652,31054916,2015-05-01,17350516,Eileen T,Carolyn is very easy to work with and she is very flexible and accommodating.  We stayed for several weeks while moving to Seattle. Her home is well appointed with everything you would need. Carolyn is excellent to communicate with. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone.
3120652,31386644,2015-05-04,31879936,Dawn,My family stayed at Carolyn's while visiting from out of state. Carolyn's home was clean and comfortable and within walking distance to all that Columbia City has to offer. They enjoyed their stay!
3120652,33734234,2015-05-31,6006307,Megan,"We arrived late on a Tuesday and found our way into Carolyn's cozy home with a note to help ourselves to whatever was in the refrigerator.  This was generous and helped with the morning milk for our coffee.  Curb appeal was not the best but once inside it was great for the four of us.  There is a spacious garden, too.  Only down side was the house was located in a bit of a transitional neighborhood.  However, 15 minutes from downtown with traffic and 20 to the airport was quite manageable.  Nice to see an up and coming part of Seattle.  Old downtown a few blocks away is great.  Park nearby obviously appreciated by locals."
3120652,33838186,2015-06-01,21321805,Laura,"Caroline's little bungalow is clean and very comfortable. Only 15 minutes from downtown Seattle it was the perfect get away spot or my two daughters and myself. We could zip into town easily or just relax at Caroline's. Caroline was very quick to respond to any inquiries, and had many helpful suggestions for great local restaurants. We would stay here again."
3120652,35205868,2015-06-16,5340985,Alexandra & David,"Communication with Carolyn was easy from the start. She was very informative about the check-in process, and it made our arrival seamless, despite a two-hour flight delay.

The house was clean and tidy when we arrived. The master bedroom bed is extremely comfortable, but for a group of four, it was definitely a bit tight (as Carolyn warned us of when we made the inquiry). The second bed (futon/air mattress combo) is fine for folks who are not too particular about needing a super supportive mattress, and the couch was very comfortable.

The kitchen was well equipped, with a coffee maker all ready to go for us in the morning, and the backyard was perfect for drinking a cup of coffee and doing yoga. The neighborhood is also fantastic. We loved being able to stroll to Empire Coffee down the road, and all the action on Ranier. It's also right near the Lightrail, so we could easily get downtown. Wonderful location!"
3120652,35789984,2015-06-22,15388990,Greg,Great house. Super clean and great set up. Would stay at Carolyn's place again for sure. Thanks for making our trip to Seattle fantastic.
3120652,36069358,2015-06-24,31040502,Rebecca,Carolyn made us feel welcome. Kind of an old neighborhood. 
3120652,36540985,2015-06-29,10874074,Matt,"Well described place in a neighbourhood that is going through transition.  Good restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  We were going to a game downtown and a cab cost less than 15 bucks.  I will note the second bedroom is equipped with an air mattress on a futon, but it was pretty comfortable.  The place is also air conditioned, which was a big bonus cause it was smoking hot.  All in all, would stay again!"
3120652,37749149,2015-07-10,8289328,Raj,"We liked our stay in Carolyn's home. Our first impression of the neighborhood was one of unease, but there were no problems during the stay and we felt quite safe. Carolyn communicated with us extensively before and during the stay, so it made moving in much easier.  We had a car so never had to use the bus system, that said we did see buses plying in the area frequently,  so I suppose it is possible to manage without a car. The house itself was comfortable, well equipped and Carolyn had the fridge stocked with the basics. We did feel the lack of a washer/dryer, staying as we did for almost 10 days but that was a minor issue.  Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.
"
3120652,38138947,2015-07-13,34546844,Michael,"The house was exactly as advertised.  Very comfortable space with updated interior and a great backyard.  Carolyn was very helpful with recommendations and any other questions I had.  The surrounding area had a lake nearby which was good for early morning runs, and great restaurants just a few blocks away.  All in all. a great place away from the city with lots to do in surrounding areas."
3120652,39170482,2015-07-21,293923,Raymond,Clear instructions given by the host. Everything about the house was exactly as described. Excellent location with 10 min drive to Downtown. 
3120652,39962512,2015-07-27,36365468,Ben,Very nice house on a quiet street with a park at the end of the block. Caroyln responded quickly to all emails and inquiries. I would definitely stay again! 
3120652,41198018,2015-08-05,1752590,Winifred,"Carolyn's house, as described in the listing, is a cozy two-bedroom cottage that was a perfect size for our group (a couple and one other adult).  It is clean and bright and very well equipped and it is clear that Carolyn has put a lot of thought and effort into organizing her space so that guests will be comfortable and find everything they need.  The beds are really comfortable and thankfully there was air conditioning, as we arrived during a rare Seattle heat wave.  We chose this Columbia City neighborhood to be close to friends, plus it is a great area, an  easy walk to a wonderful pub, bakery/coffee shop, market, restaurants and shops, and a pleasant walk to Lake Washington.  Proximity to the light rail makes it possible to get to downtown Seattle and to the airport without a car.  Carolyn is a wonderful host -- she is so well organized, we received all the information we needed for entry into and use of the house and departure from it.  Carolyn responded promptly to all inquiries and went out of her way to let us know about traffic problems in the area on the day we arrived.  Her procedures are very well thought out and clearly communicated, which made it so easy for us to come and go.  I definitely recommend Carolyn's home for visitors to Seattle, and if you go, do not miss the Columbia City Bakery, Columbia City Ale House, Geraldine's, and PCC Market."
3120652,42302700,2015-08-12,37954004,Janneke,"We loved this cozy cottage! It was clean and quiet. We loved having breakfast in the backyard, and all the restaurants for dinner closeby. The lightrail is a fun, cheap and easy way to explore Seattle. We would definitely stay here again!"
3120652,42481777,2015-08-13,40823714,Xiao,"We were kinda scared by the ""unfriendly"" neighbors when we first arrived, then we find out that they only mind their own stuffs so it's cool. The place was clean and pretty inside and it was very nice to stay in the back yard at night having little chat with friends."
3120652,44150612,2015-08-24,38198872,Mary,"My son and I enjoyed our four-day stay in Caroline's home in the Columbia City neighborhood.  There was parking out front, and plenty of space for the two of us in her cozy home.  My son enjoyed his private bedroom while I stayed in Caroline's comfortable master bedroom.  The kitchen was fully equipped for us to make breakfast after shopping at the nearby Safeway.  The cute downtown area has several eateries, including Geraldine's for breakfast which we highly recommend.  The location was great--it was easy for us to zip around and to get to the Seatte Center, Pike Street Market, Ballard, Capitol Hill, and to several other Seattle breweries.  "
3120652,46766151,2015-09-13,14481801,Karen,"We loved staying in Carolyn's cute house! It was the perfect space for us to set up shop while exploring Seattle. It is very clean and the bed in the main bedroom is super comfy. While we didn't spend much time in the back yard while we were there, it looks like a great space (with a beautiful pear tree!) Carolyn left clear instructions/tips on accessing the wifi, great eateries in the neighborhood, using public transport to get to downtown - it was much appreciated. She is also very communicative and quick to respond to any e-mails, etc. Thanks for a great stay! "
3120652,47920051,2015-09-21,43731754,Marques,"Carolyn was a very nice host who responded very quickly to my booking and all of my questions. The house was as pictured and is located close to a park, a grocery store and a few fast food places. It is also within walking distance of the light rail. Even though I didn't meet Carolyn in person, she was very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed."
3120652,48746047,2015-09-28,4350005,D. Renee,Carolyn was very responsive and super accommodating. Her place was very cozy and welcoming. There were no sheets on the bed for our arrival but it was not a problem since she had scheduled to the cleaner to come early so our toddler could nap when we arrived. The back yard was amazing and we used it a lot. I would stay here again. 
3120652,50118638,2015-10-09,17042904,Carmaleta,"This is a quaint beautiful little home in the heart of Columbia City close to all the coolest spots.  This was the perfect place to end a long day of sightseeing and playing in the city.  Would definitely book again with Carolyn, she's a fantastic hostess.  "
6466129,33733065,2015-05-31,28363826,Liu,"Chad and Andria (the airbnb manager) had been really friendly and made us feel like home! We had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful place:) We love taking walks at Greenlake and try out the awesome restaurants in the neighborhood! I highly recommend Chad's ""heart of seattle""!"
6466129,34799459,2015-06-12,24930419,Joan,"My stay in the ""Heart of Seattle"" was fantastic.  The location is great; it provides a nice central location plus the opportunity to walk around Green Lake.  It is close to restaurants/coffee shops as well.  The apartment was exactly as described, neat clean and well appointed.  The hosts were welcoming and made sure I was comfortable and I had everything I needed.  I will stay there again while vising family in Seattle.  "
6466129,35184995,2015-06-15,26240920,Jason,Great place to stay! Conveniently located. Very responsive. Thank you for a great nights sleep. 
6466129,35591581,2015-06-20,34017132,Karen,"Great host, great space.

The area is lovely and the apartment is spacious. Very clean and homey. They provide towels and extra linen. The kitchen was fully equip with all the tools and cutlery you need and clean. Wifi included as well as Netflix on the TV.

My only problem would be that you can sometimes hear footsteps from above and I am a very light sleeper. 

But besides that, the apartment is very private and quiet. Andria was very welcoming and accommodated to my requests. Had a great time!"
6466129,36035594,2015-06-24,11547818,Alexis,"The apartment's location on Green Lake is ideal. Close to the park, coffee shops and restaurants for brunch or dinner. We made coffee each morning and set out on our way. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us along with a list of places to visit and nearby restaurants. If you have a question they respond right away. Thank you for a great stay."
6466129,36562688,2015-06-29,278262,Chris,"We had a great stay at Chad & Andria's! They were very thoughtful hosts and really made the stay problem-free. The location is great with a lot to do/eat right in the immediate area. Highly recommended!
"
6466129,37492806,2015-07-07,35432672,Naheem,"Thank you Chad and Andria for your warm hospitality during our stay in Seattle. The place was exactly how it was decribed - excellent location (right by the lake), very well designed & decorated room and great service. 

I would highly recomend Chad's place to everyone. Thank you!!

Naheem"
6466129,38007856,2015-07-12,23940799,Laura,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Chad's listing for 5 nights.  Communication with Andria was easy and everything was clean and as expected.  The keys and a bottle of wine awaited our arrival.  It was quiet and well priced.  The Greenlake neighborhood was awesome- I could live there.  It was close to everything  we wanted to do as tourists and just a beautiful, active, fun place to be.  My kids loved the playground a short walk away.  

There were some steep stairs getting down into the unit (which is below the main house) and might be difficult for certain individuals with physical limitations, but was not an issue for us.  
We had a great experience and would stay here again!  "
6466129,38548772,2015-07-16,37737852,Heather,Chad and Andria were both very nice! The place was really great and in an awesome location. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. I would recommend to everyone!
6466129,38748831,2015-07-18,24286835,Jennifer,"Had a great stay at Heart of Seattle. The location was perfect, right on Green Lake. The home was clean and comfortable and anything I needed was provided. Andria was easy to get in touch with. Loved my stay, would definitely stay here again! "
6466129,38946547,2015-07-19,27511105,Cherington,Perfect experience ! The house is very comfortable and clean.
6466129,40180968,2015-07-28,39440205,William,Chad was very helpful. He suggested a few great restaurants and area attractions. He also gave us a bottle of wine to celebrate our wedding. Would definitely stay again. 
6466129,40283998,2015-07-29,39365327,Katie,"Had a great time staying here, great location & close to everything. Very clean & nice amenities."
6466129,40487299,2015-07-31,31584368,Jiawei,Nice place!!!  Clean room with great location.
6466129,40833914,2015-08-02,39373402,Chris,"Chad's place was just what we needed and hoped for.  It is a well kept space in a nice neighborhood close to the places we wanted to go, and at the end of the day a very nice place to retreat to.  
Both Chad & Andria (the manager) are very responsive & friendly.  Chad met us when we arrived & offered to help with anything we may need, but everything was set up & we lacked for nothing...
We'd do it again!"
6466129,41363445,2015-08-07,35233752,Jeanie,"Chad and Andria made us feel very welcome.  Andria was very prompt in responding to any questions we had via email before our stay.  The accommodations were exactly as described, and the Green Lake area was beautiful.  We really enjoyed staying at this location."
6466129,41963369,2015-08-10,35868965,Sharon,"The host made me feel quite welcome, answering questions in advance.  On the check-in day, the host stopped in to say hello; the day after he answered (politely, so) questions about using this listing.  The description of the listing accurately reflected what I discovered upon arrival.  The listing's pictures offered a what-you-see, what-you-will get expectation that was fulfilled throughout the stay.  The location was convenient to recreation (a 2.8 lake trail loop across the street) and restaurants up the street and around the corner, public transportation nearby, which was used several times a time.  It was a quiet, safe, cheerful location, easily accessible to Seattle's neighborhoods, downtown area and surrounding suburbs."
6466129,42323696,2015-08-12,39775235,Christy,"Great location, clean, comfortable & well set up place.  The apartment had everything we needed (coffee maker, plates, utensils, etc.).  The complimentary bottle of wine was delicious & picking blackberries & swimming in Green Lake were fabulous."
6466129,42702553,2015-08-15,27752298,Danchen,Great location! Right by the Green lake.
6466129,43297458,2015-08-18,19529022,Jason,"Chad's place was perfect for 3 days in Seattle. Clean and super comfortable. Green lake is fantastic neighborhood, and staying right on the lake was perfect for us"
6466129,43598269,2015-08-20,3252735,Gong,"This house is at a great location by the lake very safe and quiet. I arrived around 12:30 AM, and wasn't able to enter the house due to a lock issue. I contacted Andria. She immediately responded and drove all the way to the house to help us get in. She was extremely helpful in every way. Definitely a great stay. "
6466129,44744093,2015-08-28,21501446,Trey,"Chad's place is in a perfect location, and the apartment was as comfortable as described. Andria was my contact and couldn't have taken better care of me. 

You're set right on the water. It's such a breath of fresh air to walk out the door to Green Lake. Sweet people, sweet restaurants, sweet drink spots. With all that fun, it's a really healthy environment.. Everyone's moving around the lake. It was super safe, nice neighborhood.

Loved my time there"
6466129,45164559,2015-08-31,41495066,Sheena,"Chad and Andria definitely made us feel welcome. I appreciated that they were able to accommodate us a couple hours earlier than the standard check in time. The place was neat and tidy, and it was useful to have a washer and dryer. Location was great! Greenlake was at the front door, and shops and restaurants were only a couple of blocks away. Would definitely recommend this listing."
6466129,46020200,2015-09-07,41847249,Mei,"Amazing location on Greenlake!  It was such a great neighborhood.  It was nice to see bikers, runners and families on the lake path.  Parking was easy, usually right in front of the unit.  With two young kids, it was a touch tricky getting up the exterior stairs and down the steep interior stairs.  But after a couple of trips, we were pros.  Layout and space were cozy and comfortable.  Amenities were useful and worked well, especially the in-unit washer and dryer.  The welcome gift was a great, personal touch!"
6466129,47572658,2015-09-20,26476880,Kevin,"The unit was clean and well stocked. The free bottle of wine on arrival was also a nice touch. Easy to get in and out on arrival/checkout. 

Only comment is the unit is in the basement, so while the unit is right on green lake, you don't get the benefits of the view. Not much natural light. "
6466129,47766802,2015-09-21,40634640,Tyler,I was very excited to stay at this location and look great in pictures and the host was quick to answer my questions. The day of I had not received the code to get in made several phone calls and never received a call back till 10:30 am and was forced to book a hotel. The house looked great from the outside though....
6466129,48360186,2015-09-25,3709625,Eija,"We had great three days in Seattle and in Chad¬¥s place. Nice neighborhood and easy and fast access to downtown. The flat was super clean, comfortable, quiet and had everything you need. Check in and out was easy. The only disadvantage was that the flat is situated in the basement so you cannot get much daylight. Oh yes and the bottle of wine waiting on the table was very tasty:) !"
6466129,48633864,2015-09-27,7410960,Rebecca And Joel,"Chad and Andria were great hosts all around. They were incredibly responsive and accommodating. The space itself was comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the quiet, residential neighborhood with a great running/walking trail around the lake right out the door and easy parking. We felt that Chad or Andria were easily accessible with any questions however the space itself was very private. We'd highly recommend this place to other guests! "
6466129,49172683,2015-10-01,24191533,David,"I only ran into Chad a couple of times while I was there but he was really personable and easy to talk to.

I really love the house and the location.  It's just a short walk to a bunch of great places in Green Lake (restaurants, bars, cafes, etc) and you've got an amazing view of Green Lake right across the street.

The room is basically a private Mother in Law type room with it's own kitchen and bathroom which is great.   

Honestly, the best AirBnB I've stayed in so far in Seattle"
6466129,49869926,2015-10-06,22554694,Chris,Chads place was really clean and accessible to downtown Seattle. Great neighborhood and clean accommodations. 
6466129,50357491,2015-10-11,22992054,Lee,"Chad greeted us at the door of his place and seemed very nice. We did not stay very long as it was only a two day trip so we did not see him other than that. As far as the home goes, it is actually only the bottom/basement floor of the home as it appears the home is compartmentalized into several homes. You enter and leave from the back and the basement has a private entrance. The apartment itself is very nice and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. The best sleep I have had in years! The apartment is right across the street from the lake which has a nice walking path around it. Some nice little local bars and restaurants within walking distance. All and all it was a great stay, would recommend!"
6466129,50813938,2015-10-14,11637544,Lisa,Great hosts and a great location. 
6466129,50909724,2015-10-15,46408001,Keefe,"I had a phenomenal stay at this location. The place was clean, well furnished. Even a lovely bottel of Wine. And came with Netflix Too!!! I would highly recommend this location to anyone. It's great place in a beautiful part of Seattle and the Host couldn't be any more accommodating!"
6466129,51507451,2015-10-20,39760563,Matthew,On our very first trip to Seattle our host was very welcoming! The house was very nice and easy to find.  The park right out front was so nice for us.  We love to be out doors and could easily walk around the lake.  The accommodations inside we perfect for what we were looking for.  Perfect size for the two of us and a great location to just about anything we wanted to see.  We had lost the keys (our fault) at one point and Andria was very quick to respond and get back with us to replace the key!  We enjoyed everything about this place and would love to come back again!  
6466129,52527354,2015-10-30,46595183,Sophia,"Chad's place was perfect for our visit to Seattle. The location on Green Lake was beautiful and conveniently located near lots of great restaurants and coffee houses. Chad greeted us at the door to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was nicely decorated, quiet and immaculate. And the bed was amazingly comfy as other reviewers noted. We had all we needed, and more (bottle of wine an Ben and Jerry's in the freezer :)). We will definitely stay there again!"
6466129,54993407,2015-11-27,20778165,Rob,"Kept in good contact with me before the visit. The apartment was as described and directly across the street from Green Lake, a popular Seattle park. I rented this as accommodation for relatives coming for Thanksgiving as it was close to where  I live."
6466129,55242568,2015-11-29,46644002,Matthew,"There is literally not a bad word I can say about this place! Seriously Cozy and homely vibe. The complimentary wine was a nice touch...plus there was dunkin donuts brew in the cupboards :p

The hosts were extremely accommodating and polite! If I'm ever back in seattle I will be re-booking"
6466129,56283358,2015-12-11,50673707,Rhiana,"The rental unit is quite lovely and a bottle of wine on the counter is a nice touch, and the location is great!  Also, the bed is super comfy!
The one thing that was disappointing was the lack of privacy.  The listing states there is a private entrance but this is not enitrely accurate.  You must enter Chad's home to get to the door inside that is the entrance to the private unit.  This is one of 4 doors in his rear hallway.  It does not feel private to walk in the back of his home when the other doors to his living room and office are open and he is right there.   Also, it is not very quiet when he is talking or walking around upstairs.  Phone calls can be heard as well as TV or chairs rolling across the floor above.  A bit disppointing when looking for quiet.  If you are not going to be there much or don't mind a brief chat or two with your host, then it might be just fine."
6466129,56352995,2015-12-12,1243363,Daniel,"This is my favorite Green Lake location. It's right across the street from Green Lake, which is great for going on walks or runs. It's close to a number of coffee shops and restaurants. The hosts are very kind. I'd like to stay here again when the weather is nicer. "
6466129,56435203,2015-12-13,10446727,Anthony,"The place was nice and as expected.  Good location, nice blow up mattress, great for longer stays.  My only suggestion is to lower the cleaning fee, I thought it was a little over the top considering the size of the apartment."
6466129,57663761,2015-12-28,15859329,Christopher,The home was perfect for us. Never had trouble parking and we weren't far from all the items on our itinerary. Thanks a bunch!
5308339,28852888,2015-03-30,6707665,Emily,"Location was perfect for me. Room is spacious, clean and quiet. "
5308339,33009646,2015-05-24,27074733,Brenda,Hitomi was very communicative throughout the experience. We arrived later than expected and she was very accommodating and gracious about our change in plans.
5308339,33560335,2015-05-29,29283778,Dylan,Hitomi was very accommodating for our arrival plans and helpfully communicative. The place was very basic but a good value for how cheap it was. It appeared to be in the middle of some light construction. Overall we were very happy with our short stay. 
5308339,33743896,2015-05-31,34073991,Ciara,"We got in late, and since the door had a keypad on it, we were able to walk in. Hitomi was very nice and willing to help."
5308339,34609045,2015-06-09,16471967,Andy,"We had a great time staying with Hitomi. We arrived in the evening and were accommodated well; She is a really friendly person and extremely helpful. The room was great! Very large and spacious, accommodating all four of us very easily. The neighbourhood was nice and peaceful and fairly close to the city.

If we're ever back in Seattle, I would love to stay there again."
5308339,35110117,2015-06-15,13153465,Jeffrey,"Hitomi was a fantastic host. She would always make our beds, take out the trash, wash our towels, and restock our toiletries on a daily basis. She returns messages in just a few hours at most and answers any questions thrown her way. 

Hitomi's room was clean and well-organized (It's just as the listing described it to be). The room is separated from the main house by a door, but it has all the privacy that the guests may need. Additionally, the neighborhood is nice and quiet. It's located close to the I-5 freeway, making her home a convenient location for travelers & vacationers. 

For anyone who's concerned about Wi-Fi, don't be. The private room comes with it!"
5308339,35390968,2015-06-18,33085528,Dahhee,Hitomi was very helpful and friendly for our family. The room and bathroom were both clean! It was great that there was a side door through which we could enter. 
5308339,47516480,2015-09-19,42804746,Steve,Hitomi is very nice and greeted us upon arrival. She gave us all the information we needed.
5308339,47806759,2015-09-21,863606,Lancy,"Neighborhood is fine, only stayed over night so didn't really explore. But just as pictured."
5308339,48817873,2015-09-28,31193192,Kent,"Hitomi's place was super spacious, clean, and we loved the private entrance. Hitomi was also very accommodating to the fact we checked in later than expected. Also, she let us know when we accidentally left one of our luggages ‚Äî oops! She was also excellent about communicating check in process and

In terms of improvements, I would say maybe having a mini fridge. We bought some food and wanted to preserve it, but couldn't. Something minor, so no big deal.

I would highly recommend staying at Hitomi's place if you want to stay with someone who will guarantee a hospital stay!"
5308339,49349115,2015-10-03,42932741,John,"I personally enjoy the stay because its spacious and cozy. Its a quiet neighborhood. I slept through the night at ease. But unfortunately, I was only here for 1 night so I can't speak much more than I had. On the other hand, Hitomi was very friendly and helpful. I actually left my tshirt there and Hitomi offered to mail it back to me. She was great. "
5308339,51394356,2015-10-19,44432439,Bruno,"We had a nice stay at Hitomi's. We enjoyed the large room, private entrance and the convenience of the location.
W'll be back!
Marian and Bruno!"
670021,2243336,2012-09-09,3432368,Hyewon,"Tiki's house was a clean, pretty and cozy place to stay. It has a full kitchen, a living room (with TV) and a small work place. I expected a small room to sleep in but it was definitely beyond that. And even if you don't have a car, there are several bus stops near house (0.4~1mile) where you can take a bus to downtown, UW, northgate, etc. I enjoyed staying there!"
670021,2581005,2012-10-11,1798671,Karen,"They are just getting started in the BnB world so they have a few things they are still working on. My room was missing a few things to make me feel at home (like hangers, and a place to store by clothes, curtains- I let Darlene know and it was sorted out). A few things in the bathroom and kitchen needed some loving care like a constantly running toilet and leaking shower- again, Darlene tried her best to fix these things up. 

It's a bit far away from the city but there are numerous bus routes within 15 minutes walk (up and down hills). If you don't have luggage and don't mind dodging cars, it's a lovely walk on a sunny day. 

They are making more improvements to the property all the time so hopefully your stay will be nice. But where else can you be welcomed by a Native Indian-American at a few hours notice? Thanks again. "
670021,3069686,2012-12-11,1585315,Carolyn,"Very nice place to stay, and Tiki has added a coffeemaker and small dining table for those of us who can't use the high bistro table.  The room and bed are tight for two people, just right for one.  You will enjoy staying here if you don't mind sharing the house with a stranger.  It worked out fine for us.
"
670021,15780051,2014-07-15,17175740,Farshad,"Darlene is great, she helped us a lot because we were new in town. The home is very comfy and there are everything that you need in the house.

"
670021,16129311,2014-07-22,17370547,Andrew,"Really enjoyed staying with Darlene!  Her location a little remove from did town really feels like you are in western Washington, not just another city! Stayed with my girlfriend for two nights and we were both very comfortable!"
670021,16870585,2014-08-03,9390140,Roby,Darlene was great and her home is very nice and cozy. She was a great host
670021,22066946,2014-10-29,21335686,Randy,"Good for its price. Close to hwy. many stores closed by. Internet was a bit slow. The house was kept clean,  it has its unique smell to it. The provided towels were a bit old. But then again, for the price it beats the hotel. Some snacks and juices were provided.  "
670021,28931565,2015-04-01,21987799,Stiliyan,"I and my wife spent 5 months at Darlene's place. The first 3 months we were paying cash directly to her. The last two months we were using the Airbnb service.
The location is acceptable, Lake City way is in 10 min walking distance. One disadvantage the location has is that the neighborhood is not save for walk after hours.
For the first 2 months leaving at Darlene‚Äôs place was good. After that we started having troubles with her. Since Darlene leaves at the garage, her presence at the house is constant, which fine‚Äìthis is her house after all, but there were two occasions that she was drunk and she was behaving really bad. One of the times she was drunk, she unlocked and entered in second room, which was rented by another couple (they was not in the house at that moment). At that time I was at home and I told her that she is not supposed to enter in the room while the people are out, she answered me that she is the owner of the house and she can do whatever she wants, and she told me ‚Äùstupid boy‚Äù. One time she entered in our room without knock while my wife was there. So if you are looking for a place where the room you are renting has some level of privacy, maybe Darlene‚Äôs place is not the best.
There were cases, while we are at home, she came in and unplug the power adapter of our laptop. There were also cases when she was unplug the heater no matter that it was cold for us to save electric power.
About cleaning the house, in general she didn‚Äôt maintain the house clean, no matter that this was her responsibility. Sometimes it was taking more than 2 weeks for her to get us clean sheets and towels (again her every week responsibility).We would be very happy to wash and dry more frequently the sheets and towels by ourselves, but she didn‚Äôt allow us to use the washer and dryer for sheets and towels.
Two weeks before we left she came drunk and asked me what we'll do next month. I replied that we are looking for an apartment and we will not stay in her house. She got really angry, and started causing troubles. She turned off the fuse of the washer (the fuse box is in the garage) and asked us extra money to use washer and dryer. Therefore, we didn't use washer and dryer last two weeks.
The check-in to the house didn‚Äôt take time and was easy, but on the day we were checking-out Darlene came early in the morning and started cleaning the bathroom, we were not able to use the bathroom, and we should leave two hours earlier."
670021,34316400,2015-06-07,32176928,Termet,Tr√®s sympathique et plaisant endroit!
670021,42377484,2015-08-13,29717774,Xuan,"My parents came to Seattle to attend my college graduation ceremony. We stayed together at Tiki's house for one month, and after my parents left, I stayed for another month, during which I met several other nice tenants. Since Tiki converted her garage into a studio for herself, my parents and I lived next door but separately from Tiki. It was a wonderful experience for my parents and I, as the house provided us with enough privacy and Tiki was chill about a lot of things. When I went to work during weekdays, my parents took a walk around the neighborhood. It was a nice neighborhood with a lot of tall trees, which made it cool during hot days but also not much direct sunshine into the house. Tiki invited me to her daughter's party but unfortunately I didn't make it. The house was close to Safeway, QFC, gas stations, a bus stop to downtown Seattle and a bunch of restaurants. The only inconvenience was Tiki charged for laundry. Mostly my mom hand-washed our summer clothes, and I went to the nearby laundromat once. "
670021,47294382,2015-09-17,36745736,Janet,Darlene was a great host. Bed was comfortable and TV and wifi worked fine. 
3456599,17450097,2014-08-12,16111866,Bianca,It was a great experience staying at this apartment. It is in the cutest neighborhood and is conveniently located right down the street from the bus stop. We even could walk to adorable Fremont from the apartment which was another plus. The apartment had everything we needed and the keyless entry was great. We ran into our hosts outsides and got to know them a bit & they were both very kind and willing to provide us with great suggestions of Seattle sites. I will gladly stay here again.
3456599,18030690,2014-08-20,3904755,"Heather, Mike & Eleni","This was a great find.  The hosts are really accommodating and the place is just as described.  Very clean, lots of space for myself, my husband and the bub.  Great neighborhood, just up the street from a big park and close to water.  We'll likely stay here again if we are in need of a short term stay!"
3456599,18543186,2014-08-28,10421517,Chase,"I was booking the apartment for my parents' visit. The house is really nice: spacious and clean, got everything they need, with bus stop and Burke-Gilman trail just few blocks away. Also, Rebecca is a heartwarming and helpful host. My parents had a wonderful time staying here. Thanks Rebecca!"
3456599,18799517,2014-09-01,15284026,Adam,"Once we arrived in Seattle, Rebecca made us feel very welcome! The couch was very comfortable and provided a relaxing evening for us after a long week of traveling around.

I will say that the bed was a bit stiff, but not necessarily uncomfortable; just on the firmer side! We ended up using the pillows off of the couch  in addition to what was in the bedroom for additional support. 

The neighborhood was very cute! I think we would stay here again if we had a rental car. As it was, we had to walk (up hill) for about 20 mins to the nearest main street before we saw any stores, restaurants, etc. It wasn't a problem for us ( we were on vacation and weren't exactly in a rush!), but just something to keep in mind for planning purposes. Thanks again for accommodating our stay, Rebecca!"
3456599,19133877,2014-09-07,5506743,Karen,"We loved this apartment! The location was perfect (close to Gas Works Park, Burke-Gilman Trail, Fremont Brewing...), lots of space, very clean, comfy bed, Chromecast/Wifi, quiet neighborhood. Would love to stay here again.  "
3456599,19539902,2014-09-14,3715244,Rod,"Cute, clean, basement apartment met our needs perfectly. The hosts were helpful and friendly. Keyless entry worked well for us as we didn't have to keep track of a key or keycard. The motion sensing entry outside entry light was a plus. Given that this is a basement apartment, it's not surprising the ceiling is a bit lower than a normal apartment. This was not an issue for us but it may be for you if you are particularly tall. The windows are new and easy to open. The bathroom was well stocked with soaps lotions shampoos and towels. Lots of hot water as well. We didn't use the kitchen much but appreciated the refrigerator and microwave.

The neighborhood is safe to walk and the location is close to the Burke-Gilman trail. We found a bike rental place within walking distance, so we were able to bike and walk to Fremont and up the hill to Wallingford shopping/restaurant districts. The house is also near Irwin's coffee shop/bakery and the Cantinetta Italian restaurant, both gems.

We recommend this destination."
3456599,19656513,2014-09-15,21146742,Lara,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying in Rebecca's basement apartment. We ended up upgrading our rental to include the backyard space that adds use of the hot tub, grill, and hammock (all were great... clean and in good shape, although we didn't use the hammock). Everything in the apartment felt nice and fresh and new. The bed was firm but comfortable. There was even a super sweet and friendly neighborhood cat that hung out with us when we ate dinner and breakfast on the porch.

Rebecca and her husband were very friendly and respectful of our privacy. They were also very helpful and recommended a variety of fun things to do nearby. We ended up taking one of their suggestions and going kayaking on Lake Washington. It was a beautiful sunny day and we had a great time.

The house is in a nice residential part of the city. We brought our car but did end up taking a bus to get downtown one evening. The bus stop was close to the house (up a steep hill). Overall, it was a great experience. We highly recommend this apartment and the addition of the hot tub and grill were very much worth it!"
3456599,20033142,2014-09-22,2478272,Alejandra,"I stayed at this apartment for a couple of nights. The location was great. Easy walk to restaurants, coffee shops, and Lake Union. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. My only observation would have to be the fact that the mattress was too firm, it made it difficult to feel rested in the morning. If you like a super firm mattress, this might not be a problem.:) 
Other than that, the apartment is a good option for exploring the Wallingford neighborhood and the rest of Seattle. Thank you!"
3456599,21151570,2014-10-12,15157739,Kelly,"Rebecca and Rodrigo were awesome, responsive and helpful hosts.  The place was as described. We had a great time. "
3456599,22407317,2014-11-05,4848876,Ellen,"The lock on the door was super handy! The apartment was very clean and true to the photos. Rebecca was even kind enough to give us a bottle of wine after they had some guests during they day as an apology for the extra noise. Unfortunately, we couldn't meet due to schedules, but we had a blast!"
3456599,22610732,2014-11-10,1537596,Mark,"What a great place to spend a night in the Seatle area. The space was well cared for and very clean....the bead was perfect! Close to great restaurants and downtown Seattle, we could not ask for a better place to stay. Rebecca was a perfect host responding quickly to our request and accommodating our last minute requests. Thank you for a great Air BNB experience. I highly recommend this accommodation to anyone wishing to stay in the Seatle area"
3456599,24272609,2014-12-24,23980603,Nathan,"Rebecca and Rodrigo were great hosts, and their house was a lovely place to stay.¬†¬†They went out of her way to make sure we had a pleasant stay, and to make sure we had clean linens/let us use their washing machines, and the overall location is super convenient and within walking distance of some great restaurants."
3456599,24411612,2014-12-28,19355126,Bob,Apt was as described. Area has many restaurants and markets for getting supplies needed. A few blocks down is Gas Works Park with activities and great view of Seattle skyline. Public transportation close so easy to maneuver around city.  Rebecca provided all info needed to access the apartment with early communication.  
3456599,34327830,2015-06-07,2357124,Teal,"Terrific experience. Rebecca and her husband were warm, and made sure we had everything we need. Their place is located in the heart of Wallingford, a terrific neighborhood that felt like home by the end. Highly recommend this place!"
3456599,34557417,2015-06-09,33401815,Kayli,"Rebecca made us feel welcome! The house was exactly as pictured and described, clean and they provided all the linens needed for the house. They are located near lots of fun things to explore. Parking outside was free and easy. I would definitely return to stay at their place. "
3456599,35100854,2015-06-15,32551806,Kathi,"Great location! Clean, easy access, everything you need to be comfortable. We will stay again when in Seattle! Rebecca was very accommodating, we added a guest at the last minute and she made sure we had bedding etc. .Thanks for the stay!"
3456599,35339924,2015-06-17,5061067,Roman,"This stay was great. The anonymity of a hotel with the comfort of home. I often dislike the hassle of meeting the host, I know that makes me sound like a toad, but I'm just a bit introverted and once I get off a 4 hour flight the last thing I want to do is talk to someone. 

Key code entrance to my own private studio. Easy-peasy-japanesey."
3456599,35928560,2015-06-23,32098304,Chelsea,"Rebecca's place was absolutely perfect for my trip to Seattle.  I came with three other friends and we arrived to clean linens and towels for each one of us, and Rebecca left out a binder with a list of helpful hints and things to do around the beautiful neighborhood. It was the perfect spot-- walking distance from gasworks and Fremont. The apartment living style was perfect for us because we could cook meals and save some money. :) We all enjoyed are stay and would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle!!"
3456599,36156238,2015-06-25,5280414,Brian,"Such a great location and the apartment was perfect for us. In a nice quiet neighborhood but close to plenty of great things to do. Rebecca was very hospitable and made the place perfectly cozy - she also let us stay with very short notice, which was accommodating and thoughtful."
3456599,36317851,2015-06-27,34598848,Justin,"Great stay!  The listing description was accurate, getting in was very smooth and easy.  The apartment was clean and perfect for our needs.  The neighborhood is great, beautiful to just walk around with lots of gardens in front yards and the parkways.  Close to cool places to eat and drink and a short walk to Gasworks park which was real pretty.  Would definitely stay here again.  "
3456599,36558039,2015-06-29,10569329,Laurie,The response time was very fast and the place was clean and neat- the proximity to town is amazing and the coffee shop up the street is a perfect way to start the day! 
3456599,41640130,2015-08-08,6017305,Niki,"The place was perfect! I was unfamiliar with Seattle and was a bit concerned about being outside of downtown, but I actually ended up liking Wallingford and Fremont WAY better than downtown. It was such a cool vibe out there.

The unit is exactly how it looks. Slept 3 very comfortably. My friends were supposed to swap couch/bed after one night, but the friend who took the couch said she slept so well she didn't want the bed.

YOU HAVE COMPLETE PRIVACY. I did not even meet Rebecca, although she was fully available when I needed her. I will say I got a bit nervous as I didn't get the keypad code until day of, but I did not reach out until the day before our visit so it was kind of my fault.

Also, she let us keep our bags in there a little after checkout, so we didn't have to lug them around the city before leaving. That was a huge help and definitely unnecessary as I asked her an hour before check-out.

But anyway, I'd definitely stay there again. Loved the unit, area, and privacy, and Rebecca was as helpful as could be."
3456599,42587725,2015-08-14,39822017,Clarissa,Lovely neighborhood. Accommodation was clean and comfortable. Thanks!
3456599,43629454,2015-08-21,20495696,Brian,"Great place. Perfect for bike riding, just 2 blocks off Burke Gilman Trail. Walking distance to restaurants in Wallingford,  U District and Fremont. Rebecca was very responsive and accommodating."
3456599,44315537,2015-08-25,13324668,Marion,"Host family is lovely, prompt communication, easy access instruction.
The place is fairly new, adequate but has a really strong cat pee odor.
We bought a bag of room fresher, odor eliminator, febreeze etc, had all window and the door open with a fan working 24/7 in the living room, still the smell was very very bad. There is no way the host is not aware of this, it is THAT strong. It needs to be addressed professionally, otherwise it becomes a deal breaker. Also, the large TV is not hooked up to cable, so it functions as a DVD screen. The actual DVD player had no remote, so it took quite some time and the help of our gracious host to make it work."
3456599,44939202,2015-08-30,3221061,Zachary,"Great location and place. Walked to Fremont and to Wallingford. Clean and very comfortable. Didn't get to meet host, but everything was great!"
3456599,45262275,2015-09-01,37363162,Heather,"The basement apartment was as pictured, comfortable, and overall was a great place to stay. We received the entry code and clear instructions on how to use the lock a couple of days before we arrived. The location was wonderful: walkable to several restaurants and Gas Works Park, parking was easy, and it never took more than 3/4 minutes to get an Uber car when we needed one.

After our first night we noticed a problem with odor/moisture which Rebecca immediately investigated and made an effort to correct after we brought it to her attention. Rebecca took our concerns and input about the odor very seriously, and communication was great throughout our stay. I would absolutely recommend the apartment, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there the next time I find myself in Seattle."
3456599,45715162,2015-09-05,42062786,Kelli,Very responsible host. I would recommend to a friend!
3456599,46150871,2015-09-08,29902164,Ryn,"Such a charming home in a great location; walking distance to some cute restaurants and coffee shops. We were visiting my sister and brother in law in Fremont (too small for guests) and it was only a six minute drive to them. It was very clean and neutral with a nice backyard feature; a perfect mini getaway for a weekend. It's a basement apartment with its own separate entrance so it still feels private. Easy instructions on how to access the various electronics and wireless too. 

While a leak was repaired downstairs, we stayed in the upstairs house, which was absolutely darling-a nice entertaining space complete with a media room, a large dining space and a cute front porch. I know it's their personal living space so I was very grateful they offered it while repair work was done last minute. 

Overall, a wonderful experience! "
3456599,51537728,2015-10-21,42821165,David,The basement flat was very spacious and was very comfortable. The house is located in a fantastic position and was a great place to relax in as well as explore what Seattle has to offer. The hosts were very welcoming and responded quickly to any requests.
3456599,52620889,2015-10-31,30485829,Nicholas,"Very lovely stay in a very convenient location, perfect for my 1 week stay. Check in was very easy and everything was as described, very clean and comfortable. I will be staying there again."
3456599,54525128,2015-11-21,30485829,Nicholas,This was my second stay with Rebecca and it was as simple and pleasant as the first. The apartment was clean and comfortable as usual. Would recommend to anyone.
3456599,55396011,2015-12-01,22226010,Wyatt,"Very welcoming and comfortable home. The area was awesome, stayed there with my parents for a long weekend and we had a great time. "
3456599,55889889,2015-12-07,14254405,E. P.,"An effortless stay, absolutely as described and very clean. "
3456599,57036301,2015-12-21,24679815,Tracie,"Rebecca's place is exactly how it's listed. It was very suiting for us (3 total). She communicated promptly (even when I messaged her as I landed). I was contemplating about renting a car (because we all had different arrival and departure times and it's about $32-$40 one way with uber). She replied back quickly to confirm there was plenty of free residential parking. The place is cute, two of us slept on the bed and one on the couch. She was very accommodating, gave us lots of info, even gave us suggestions based on what we like to do. She provided extra sheets and a comforter for the couch sleeper, there's a full kitchen with enough things to cook with if you decided to stay in, she also provided towels for all of us. There's a nice large fridge, heating was great, everything ran so smoothly! Oh and she offered early check in. Loved it! Would completely stay here again! Thanks so much, Rebecca!"
4688603,25833412,2015-01-26,20619908,Ka-Lani,"Vandana had her roommate check us in. Char the roommate was very flexible which took stress off our check in travel day. Nice bathroom, clean condo style flat. Roommate Char offered us muffins and coffee, she was very sweet. The bed was probably the only slight downside, not the most comfortable. All and all I would recommend this place to other travelers."
4688603,26120194,2015-02-03,7274055,Shing,"Easy access to the freeway and city.  On street parking was easy and never had a problem finding a spot, although I was offered off street parking.  View of Lake Union and the city was beautiful.  Comfortable room and clean bathroom.  Good communication."
7430679,41661407,2015-08-08,7153595,Andrew,"We enjoyed staying with Lu. While she can be hard to get in contact with at first, please do not let this discourage you. She is courteous, sweet, and a very generous host. The room in Lu's home is very private with it's own full bathroom and removed from the rest of the space. It also has its own patio area, which we certainly would have used if we stayed for longer than 1 day. 

We had a late redeye flight back to the east coast, and despite only staying one day, Lu was more than happy to accommodate our request to leave a bag with her while we toured the entire city, returning at 7pm to pick the bag up. She went well above and beyond with that, and we were truly grateful. Given our short stay we did not interact much with Lu, but she was respectful and kind. We arrived late and she showed us right to our room which was made beautifully and the bathroom with a clean set of towels. 

We would 100% recommend Lu to anyone looking for a convenient location near Capitol Hill a few miles outside of the city (.75 mile walk to nearest bike share, 3 miles, or $12 cab to Pike Place Market)."
7430679,41902604,2015-08-09,1803479,Joel,Lu was a wonderful and welcoming host. She has a great home and even allowed me to play her piano. She made my short stay in Seattle very pleasant and gave me some vegetable soup in the morning!
7430679,42232475,2015-08-11,4308645,Drew,"Nice, clean room on its own floor of the house. Nice private patio area connected to the room. House is situated on the side of a very steep hill if that's a problem for anyone. Overall good experience."
7430679,43119402,2015-08-17,8693483,Tony,"The listing was what it was plus more.  You get your own basement sort of, and the bed is really comfortable and the backyard little patio is a great addition.  Great place and Lu was very nice and hospitable, thank you Lu!"
7430679,44011597,2015-08-23,40064541,Lingtong,"Lu was a wonderful host. Her place is super clean, and basically has everything you need. Her home is located in a nice, quiet neighbourhood, and it takes a 5-10 min walk to the bus stops that can take you to the downtown, lake, and university of Washington, etc. 
We had a late flight back home, so we asked Lu if we could leave our baggage at her place and come to pick the bag up around (website hidden) accommodated our request kindly. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was great. 
Highly recommended.
"
7430679,44831916,2015-08-29,7038422,Kevin,The location and room were great. The bed was very comfortable and Lu was a gracious host.
7430679,56783487,2015-12-18,6442814,Heather,Nice stay in a centrally located (though never had any issues with parking!) neighborhood. I work nights so the basement (with private patio and bathroom) was perfect. 
2642359,15562770,2014-07-11,6742513,Geoff,"Spacious room in convenient location - Accommodations exactly as shown and advertised.  Quiet location, clean, and comfortable bed.  "
2642359,17417654,2014-08-11,6642969,Samuel,David was very welcoming; check-in and check-out were straightforward and easy.   
2642359,17547218,2014-08-13,19782114,Nashad,"It was clean, cozy place for staying. The host was friendly. However the host should have mentioned in the ad that he has dogs. There was no soap or shampoo in the bathroom. So I would recommend guests to bring their own. Overall comfortable staying for the money paid"
2642359,18219754,2014-08-23,3192103,Nik,As advertised.  Comfortable and David was very accommodating.  
2642359,18290279,2014-08-24,13740672,Phil,"David responded immediately to my call when I arrived, got me to the apartment and gave me the information I needed including WiFi. He was laid up and we communicated via phone and text. Room was as advertised and fine for a one night crash and had a separate bathroom with toiletries. large screen TV was available and kitchen and no problems"
2642359,18390613,2014-08-25,4028953,Gregory,David was very prompt with his communication and the room was exactly as advertised. 
2642359,18606041,2014-08-28,7689932,David,"David was very welcoming. I had a couple of personal requests that he was quick to accommodate me with. The location of bedroom and bathroom are fairly secluded from the rest of the house and are right next to each other.  He has two marvelous beasts that are always happy to see you, lovable and above all else non-disruptive.  David was very respectful and I would highly recommend staying at his condo.  "
2642359,18631786,2014-08-29,10641556,Michael,"David was welcoming and accommodating about check in times & parking. Place was accurately described, and dogs very friendly."
2642359,18842402,2014-09-01,3384736,Amanda,"The two big dogs that live here are simply the sweetest! The house is a little far away from downtown but with the money you save on the rate, you can put it towards Lyft/Uber or even take the bus. Bus stop is located just 20 seconds outside of the building. 
The memory foam bed is SO comfortable. You never wanna get up. The bedroom and bathroom and downstairs so there's plenty of privacy. We only met David once to ask him if we could stay for an extra day but other than that, no interaction. If you like privacy, this is a good option. He is always reachable by text or email. And be sure to ask for the WiFi password!
Finding the actual condo in the  was a little tricky. Ask the neighbours/mailman or even call David himself."
2642359,19251712,2014-09-08,20242835,Melinda,"David was an easy going guy ! I am an introvert and a bit of a hermit, and the room was near the front door with an adjacent bathroom, easy access and his door is always open. I never felt like I was intrusive! 
The room is exactly as pictured, its very large and he has two sweet dogs that I fell in love with. :)
The apartment is about 15-20 away from the center of the city, but the price was unbeatable and the building was also very quiet.

"
2642359,22344255,2014-11-03,21791719,Cindy,Awesome experience! Definitely have your privacy. Bus stop about a minute or less walk from his place. Two big loveable dogs. Great first airbnb experience. 
2642359,22574498,2014-11-09,181621,Barbara,"David was an excellent host. He was quiet and allowed me my privacy but was welcoming and immediately available by text.

David's place is large and tastefully decorated.  The bed was super comfortable. The room is very large, with a large closet and private bathroom just outside the door. Parking was directly in front of the condo.

The ad mentions dogs but I never heard a peep out of the dogs th e whole time I was there. Wish my dogs were that well behaved:-).

Located directly across the street from Magnuson Park - a huge Seattle park with many waterfront trails and activities.

I will definitely stay here again."
2642359,22964970,2014-11-18,23350507,Adam,"Wonderful! David was very welcoming. The room was exactly as the photos show it. Very spacious, spotlessly clean, light and warm.  Convenient 7Eleven, and a coffee shop/bakery. Close to bicycle trail. Perfect. 

I did have trouble finding the apt as there is inadequate signage within the complex. But just find parking spot 107 and you have arrived."
2642359,24149900,2014-12-21,23245916,Joshua,"This room was perfect! Very spacious, by the front door, and next to a bathroom! Plenty of parking and two beautiful dogs to play with if you like! David responded to all questions very quickly and staying an entire month was no issue! Thanks David! "
2642359,24999284,2015-01-04,24447491,Binh,Great and friendly host.
2642359,25215369,2015-01-09,25392748,Louisa,"I was gone during the day, so I didn't really have the chance to get to know David but he seemed super nice and offered me help if I needed it. Be careful with your food: I had unopened candy and bread in my bagback and the dogs still found a way to eat it while I was out of the room for 2 minutes and left the door open. ANYWAYS they are super adorable!!

There are only two negative things I have to say: First the apartment was very hard to find. It took me and my driver about 15 minutes but once you know where it is, it's easy. Ask David for a description before you arrive. Second, there was construction going on directly in and around the apartment. No way to sleep in longer than 7:00 am and no fun staying in the room after that with the extreme loud noises. And since I was there for vacation, sleeping in was one of the things I really looked forward too :(
I wish David had told me this before I arrived because I'd chosen a different room then.
But since the constructions aren't going on until forever, I would still totally recommend the room."
2642359,25765529,2015-01-25,20613361,Ben,"Staying with David was just what I needed for my weekend workshop held in adjacent Magnuson Park. David welcomed me graciously. Because of my schedule, and his, I didn't see him again, but all went well. I enjoyed use of the kitchen, and my room was private and as portrayed on the website. Thank you, David."
2642359,26852784,2015-02-20,17468680,Kate,David's place is terrific!  He is very quiet and accommodating. The bed is super comfortable and It comes with a private bath. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again
2642359,27549284,2015-03-07,11406671,Ryan,"David was a friendly and welcoming host and made me feel comfortable staying in the house and using the shared spaces. His two dogs are friendly and energetic, they definitely brightened up my mornings. The neighborhood is quiet and has a trail for running/biking as well as a bus stop right next to the condo. Thanks for a great stay!"
2642359,28528315,2015-03-25,12990307,Michelle,A pleasure stay! Very easy going and spacious room. Love the private bath and location is manageable. Would definitely consider staying again! 
2642359,28760284,2015-03-29,6263051,Virginia,David's place is as described.  Bedroom and bathroom are on entry level.  The bed is super comfortable and neighborhood very quiet.  Great place to stay and would stay here again.  
2642359,29901043,2015-04-13,18067949,Joshua,"David was an amazing host! He's very friendly and just an overall cool, laid back guy! His place is very clean for him to have two dogs! By the way, his dogs are adorable! The room I stayed in was spacious and I had my own bathroom! I will definitely request to stay there again when visiting Seattle!"
2642359,31474446,2015-05-05,14152080,Debbie,David was very accommodating of my travel schedule and made it easy to check in and out. His place was clean and comfortable to stay in. The bedroom and bathroom are on its own level so you definitely have your own space and privacy. He and his two dogs were very friendly! 
2642359,32145099,2015-05-14,5084137,Sean,"Staying at David's was a great experience. Being really close to bus lines made it a convenient spot, and the room was comfortable and clean. David himself was a wonderful host, a great communicator, and he really went above and beyond to help me out of a jam while I was staying with him. I would recommend David's place to anyone."
2642359,32799629,2015-05-21,29006075,Lucy,"David was very polite, unfortunately with my schedule I wasn't able to get to know him. My experience was great! The bed was comfortable, location was convenient for me, I had my own bathroom, he was very quiet during evening hours and parking was just a few steps away from the main entrance. "
2642359,33278087,2015-05-26,20478235,Li,"David is a laid back guy, but to be honest, the house was kinda hard to find and the room smells weird. The bathroom is small and you don't have place to put the towels, so every morning after you wash your face or take the shower, you gotta go back to your room to grab the tower. The neighborhood is in construction, every morning we were waken up very early by some noise, overall, it was not a good experience. With the price we paid, we could have chose a way better room."
2642359,33602629,2015-05-30,32416601,Reese,"funny,handsome,cute host,lol...very nice apartment ,very safe neighbourhood that he even don't lock his door,I'm a little shooked I always want a safe neighbourhood,so there's a little jerious:) .He has two  cutiest dogs .I want to steal jersey someday:)"
2642359,34307323,2015-06-07,20187411,Angelica,"Nice, clean, and cozy room. The bed is super comfy. 
As other reviews mentioned, the apartment complex is indeed in the middle of a major remodel, but we were there over a weekend and it was pretty quiet. 
David was very friendly and his dogs were adorable!"
2642359,35577055,2015-06-20,5739646,Richard & Simon√©,"Had a great stay at Davids! He met us at his place and even reserved a private parking space for us. The room is great and really private, it's right beside the front door. The place itself is spacious and we were welcome to watch tv and use everything in the kitchen. David was also very happy to help us pick out the sights in Seattle and recommend us restaurants. Davids two dogs are really sweet and were a plus for us as dog-lovers."
2642359,35873696,2015-06-22,35787374,Andrew,"David was a fantastic host. The house was clean and comfortable. He was super laid back and nice and has a couple great dogs. The bed was really comfortable too. It was located across from a bus station too which was nice. Overall, it was a great experience. "
2642359,36598736,2015-06-29,35951758,Barbara,"The host was not there when we arrived though we came later than expected.
He did answer our call and let us know how to access the place."
2642359,38014717,2015-07-12,35022966,Alex,I had a great time staying with David. The room was as presented in the pictures (quite large) with a separate private bathroom. I had a quiet restful time without any issues.
2642359,39209186,2015-07-21,37322321,Maureen,Very nice place to stay while I visited my daughter who is a UW grad student. The bed was very comfortable and the room was large and the bathroom very nice. If you like to sleep late you might want to check that the remodel on the building is finished. Not a problem for me but it might be for a night owl.
2642359,39652706,2015-07-25,12306027,Angie,"The place was a little hard to find but David was there to guide us. He saved us a parking spot and everything.

The room was huge and we had a private bathroom. It was clean and inviting... then there were these dogs. They were amazing. Well trained and friendly, I just wanted to take them home. I would definitely come back again."
2642359,40003405,2015-07-27,37809074,Kristen,"David was very nice and welcoming! The apartment is in a great neighborhood, we thought it was great that he even had a parking spot right in front of the building. We absolutely loved his dogs they were so sweet. We had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
2642359,40540161,2015-07-31,6698158,Adrienne,"Super friendly and sweet dogs and a nice clean place.  The construction outside was loud in the mornings, but hopefully that is only temporary."
2642359,41274238,2015-08-05,36287831,Marjorie,We needed a place to crash for the night. The room was very big and the bed really comfortable. David met us outside to make sure we parked in the right spot. The townhouse was very nice. His two dogs are really friendly and wanted to play whenever we opened out door. There is a good pizza place within walking distance.
2642359,41654185,2015-08-08,34976812,Steven,"The tag says queen, but the bed is fit for a king. Extremely spacious, clean room, and two lovable dogs that were just adorable to be around. This coming from somebody that's terrified of the animals too. Super convenient parking spot right outside as well.
There are buses to bring you to U-District and Downtown only a block away and they run between every half hour to an hour, even in the wee morning hours.
We didn't get to interact with David very much because of our conflicting hours, but the few moments we shared were hospitable and pleasant. "
2642359,42614820,2015-08-14,14697942,Ben,"David seems like a nice guy, but I did not find him to be a good host.

First, the good things about the experience: The room is quite large and the bed is comfy. You have your own parking spot and the location is near a beautiful park.

However, not informing your guest that there is construction in your housing complex and that as a result there won't be blinds on the windows and that construction workers will be coming into the house early in the morning while you are staying  is not a sign of a accommodating host. Basic considerations like a hand towel for the bathroom, a fan for a hot room and things like clean bowls in the kitchen were not available. Also, David and his girlfriend were pretty loud. I had to be up early for work but they were up late talking (I had to keep the windows open because the room was so hot), also there were lots of stomping in the room above me. Then early in the morning the construction started. The bedroom and bathroom smelled a little weird and I think there were some stains on the rug in the room. 

If you're looking for a place to crash after exploring the city and lights & noise don't wake you up, this seems like an OK choice. However you can probably find better housing in more convenient locations for the same price. If you are planning to stay definitely confirm with David that they are done with the construction!"
2642359,43397831,2015-08-19,38808554,Kelly,"David was a nice guy and had a beautiful home. However, my boyfriend and I experienced some issues with our stay. There was a lot of construction going on in the building which was very loud in the morning. Painters came into the apartment without a warning when we were home alone. The bed broke and we had to fix it many times a day. David did try to fix it but it still had issues. My boyfriend also woke up with what we think were flea bites (he has two dogs). After telling David, he did change the sheets and clean the room. I appreciated his attempt to fix the problems we ran into; however, it did not change the fact that many problems occurred. This was my first experience with airbnb and I was disappointed."
2642359,43857953,2015-08-22,19456363,Doris,"Very spacious room and private bathroom as described and shown in the pictures. Nice neigbourhood and the parking spot right next to the apartment was a big plus for us. We had everything we needed for our short stay in Seattle. As mentioned in other reviews, the ongoing remodel of the building is a bit of a nuisance, but hopefully soon finished. "
2642359,44062521,2015-08-23,41098347,Di,"David is very nice and welcoming. He give us extra blanket and pillow for night cause we add one more girl. It is a very big clean room and has private bathroom. He has two very friendly dogs always waiting outside of our room, which is super cute."
2642359,44974075,2015-08-30,41065740,Rachael,"Great place to stay!  The room was huge and very clean.  David was very accommodating.  He provided clean towels, toiletries, a parking spot, and access to fridge space.  Do nail down the details of getting to the apartment before you arrive though--it is tricky to find.    "
2642359,46517022,2015-09-11,15233954,Deb And Steve,Description was accurate.  Room and bathroom were private and very comfortable.  A bit hard to find but David gave good directions.
2642359,46687728,2015-09-12,42783891,Katie,"David was nice, and accepted a last minute booking, which saved us from a scary place, lol.  The room is exactly like the picture and just outside is a bathroom that was nice.  It was pretty warm that night, and it seems no one has air conditioning up there, so all we could do was open the windows and unfortunately there was no wind.  We didn't sleep very well with all the noise from upstairs and outside.  But the bed was comfortable, the room was big and clean, towels and extra blankets were provided, the bathroom was big. There is also a nice a porch with a cool view, and he said we could use his living room and watch TV if we wanted, which was nice."
2642359,47927357,2015-09-21,38786939,Jay,David was not home when I got there but he gave me instruction and told me to watch out for a huge dog that is going to give me lots of love and that is what Jersey his big dog did. I connected with her right away. The room was huge just like I like. I made the mistake of leaving the door open a little and Jersey got to my food and had a field day. She later got sick which was good. i was happy she was OK. I had a nice talk with David and his girlfriend. Very nice and friendly. i would definitely stay here again
2642359,48887542,2015-09-29,24164409,Alix,"The room was exactly as pictured - very large and clean and nice. Bathroom also clean and nice. Building under construction but that didn't bother me at all. 
The only problem was the ceiling of the room is also the floor of David's room and the sound really carries - you can hear not only David walking around but even the dogs' footsteps and tail wags. Since I was still on east coast time and therefore not on the same schedule as David, this did wake me up. 
Other than that, great room!
And there is a gorgeous bike path literally steps from the door. I went on a bunch of long runs on it. Beautiful!"
2642359,49084272,2015-09-30,6097333,Karen,My stay was short and sweet Jersey the dog made it all the better hanging with me all night in my room ..love that pooch..clean room clean bathroom perfect for what I needed..only con is not so soundproof but if you are getting up early like I was it's no big deal .David was friendly and we spoke only briefly 
2642359,50412469,2015-10-11,38391581,Michael,Room was as advertised with a comfy bed. David was nice and hospitable. The directions can be tricky so nail this down before arriving. 
2642359,51800524,2015-10-24,8801318,Adna,"I enjoyed my 4 nights in David's house. The room was large, warm and the bed was super comfortable. He has two lovely and friendly dogs which was actually the reason I actually decided to stay there. 
I was interested in checking out the north part of the city so the apartment was in an ideal situation for my needs. If you are interested in doing stuff downtown it will take you about 40mins to get there with a bus. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle. "
2642359,52027154,2015-10-25,2898309,Eileen,Listing photo and description accurate. Host very prompt in relies.

He was very patient, and guided me on the phone so calmly that made it so much easier.  The location is very centralized, the room is clean, easy access to the bathroom, and my two night stay worked out well.  Thank you David.  Yes I would stay there again."
2642359,55316297,2015-11-29,48356328,Loren,"Our inter action was quite simple and to the point. Keys were made available. 
The room and bathroom was quite nice and adaquite. Getting around was minutes away to most areas of Seattle. Parking was on a bit steep, but right out side the door. 
Loved the Greatfull Bread coffee shop and bakery not too far away!"
2642359,55845579,2015-12-06,49837849,Ben,"Thanks! After a full day of meetings it was great to come back for a relaxing , good nights sleep. Liked the park across the street for morning runs. The room and bathroom setup makes it like a separate suite. Clean, comfortable and convenient. Thanks again for sharing your home. "

9183838,55880754,2015-12-06,4822953,Svetlana,"Unfortunately my experience with the Belltown apartment in Seattle is very very disappointing :(  I hate to complain or write negative reviews, however I have to do it.
The first, this apartment we booked for 3 guests. There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. 
The second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( 
The third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... 
We at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! 
One more thing... The building is very old so it is very smelly :( .. 
The next one, we also paid a cleaning fee 84$. But all hitters are dusty.
The last,  but also very stressful... The address of the building  is 304 Bell street , and there should be a lock with an apartment's key, but the lock was attached to the 308 Bell street building's door :( who knew it ?!? :( 
to figure out all these issues I had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now I can imagine my Fido bill !   stay away from this place ! I am  a Airbnb member since 2011, I am not picky at all,  but this time it was to much :( "
587584,1757896,2012-07-20,2947953,Devin,"At the last minute my partner and I decided to make a short trip to Seatte. On short notice, Aexix was able to accommodate us and our two dogs in their great house. The yard was an amazing space for the dogs to explore while we relaxed on the font porch, back deck, and outdoor space. Would definitely recommend to others"
587584,1783469,2012-07-23,2949645,Terra,"We stayed at this home for three nights and it was just perfect for our needs. She only advertises two rooms but we were able to pull the little futon into the study and it was a perfect third bedroom for a child. The host was thoughtful (there was a muffin basket with a welcome card which had the wifi password on it) and accommodating. When we had trouble finding the place we called her and she came out front to wave us into the small parking space they provided (by the way, don't bring a large car as our four door impala barely fit). Also a great location for those planning a trip to the zoo."
587584,1862821,2012-08-01,2904146,Randy,Nice house and great hosts.  Greenlake is a great getaway and there are so many things within walking distance from the house.  We had a nice stay.
587584,1984037,2012-08-14,2920212,Alice,"Very comfortable house.  Three of us stayed here and we had plenty of room.  It was spotlessly clean and we were welcomed with bagels, fruit, coffee beans and a grinder.  The kitchen was well supplied with dishes and pots;  the bathroom with towels and soap.  The beds were comfortable.  We would definitely recommend this to our friends and would stay there again on a trip to Seattle."
587584,2021785,2012-08-18,2767785,Donna,"We enjoyed our stay very much.  Cute house with a great Seattle atmosphere.  Both bedroom beds were comfortable.  We didn't need to use the additional sleeeping space in the living room, but good to know it was there.  Owners were very thoughtful hosts.  We'll be back!"
587584,2048671,2012-08-20,3255367,Barbara,"Home is laid out very nice/efficiently, even had a small electric coffee grinder during our stay there.  Pictures do not do not do it justice. Clean, inviting, comfy beds and plenty of towels. Was nice to be able to sit out on the patio and enjoy the yard/beautiful Seattle weather. Would highly recommend. And would stay there again! Thank you Aexis for accommodating us on short notice!"
587584,2166483,2012-09-01,2748541,Tom,"Aexis and Alexis were very kind hosts and even picked us up in Downtown! The apartment is well located, spacious and tastefully decorated, and the neighbourhood is really charming. Be sure to have a coffee on top of the road at Diva's."
587584,2216297,2012-09-06,3230946,Melissa,"My family and I had a great stay. The house was very spacious, which is important with two small kids. We were greeted with a lovely basket of bagels and fruit and fresh coffee to grind. We spent a lot of time on the deck. Will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it for families a the house was very close to Green Lake, Woodland zoo and many shops.  "
587584,2267201,2012-09-11,3405911,Elizabeth,This was our first experience with airbnb and will not be the last. Aexis's place was roomy and quiet and we loved her special touches all over the place. Thoughtful and friendly. Loved the cookies on the pillow!! :)
587584,2323321,2012-09-17,3485710,Danielle,"Wonderful place. 
Clean and lovely with a modern Zen feel.

Hosts had super communication and paid attention to all the details like abundant clean linens, tea kettle, fabulous showerhead, chocolates on the bed, comfy pillows, a welcome basket, lovely outdoor space, a place to park, etc., etc.

Plus, it's a great neighborhood with walkability to Greenlake and surrounding spots: Greenlake Wine Bar, Jodee's smoothies and organic desserts, and plenty more."
587584,56937153,2015-12-20,28292561,Jiahao,Nice and quite place. Easy access to downtown SeattleÔºà5 minutes walk from bus stationÔºâ.Would be my first choice if I go to Seattle againÔºÅ
1633986,16149415,2014-07-22,13884145,Barry,"This location is simply superb. The apartment is spacious, bright and near a plethora of coffee shops and restaurants. The view from the windows are spectacular and the bed is quite comfortable. Jesse has been very accommodating and a pleasure to book with. I would definitely stay here again."
1633986,16792127,2014-08-02,17651888,Matthew And Joe,"Jesse was a great host. Perfect amount of communication, responded immediately when we contacted him during our stay, and was flexible with check in/out times.  He went above that by leaving a bottle of (excellent) rose wine in the refrigerator. 

The space offered everything we needed during our stay. The location is convenient to everything (downtown, buses, bars, markets, restaurants). It's on the top floor with windows at the front and back of the apartment, giving a nice cool morning/evening breeze. Kitchen is small, but well stocked. We had a few great meals, thanks to Jesse offering free range of supplies.

Highly recommended"
1633986,18387003,2014-08-25,130904,Jane,"The apartment was absolutely gorgeous, perfectly charming, clean, and the location couldn't be beat.  There were wonderful bath products and the bed was super comfortable.   Most of the coffee shops, bars and restaurants we wanted to check out were within walking distance.  Street parking was slightly tricky as it's a very central downtown neighborhood, but there is a parking lot exactly two blocks over that was inexpensive and convenient.  Jesse was extremely attentive and easy to reach whenever we needed, he couldn't have been a better host.  Thanks  Jesse!"
1633986,18813592,2014-09-01,6013852,Freddy,"Jesse was a very accommodating host.  Any questions or requests that we had, he was very fast to respond.  The apartment was clean and in a great neighborhood.  I would definitely stay there again."
1633986,19488178,2014-09-13,14316766,Marty,Jesse was very accommodating and friendly and easily reached. He made it very easy to pickup keys and find the place. His apartment was very convenient to downtown and was clean with everything I needed.
1633986,23026319,2014-11-20,1730971,George And Megs,"Staying at Jesse's was great. Even while being away on a trip he was determined to make our stay as nice possible. If you're ever in Seattle, drop in and say hey!"
1633986,30644637,2015-04-25,2880491,Todd,"Staying at Jesse's was awesome. The apartment was clean, spacious, and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. It's also in a great location with tons of restaurants, coffee shops and bars in walking distance.  Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
1633986,33180050,2015-05-25,32458903,Samantha,"Jesse's apartment was amazing!! The historic charm of the building, mixed with the location on Capitol Hill made our stay in Seattle very memorable. The listing was very accurate. The bed and couch were both very comfortable and the place was well-kept and tidy! Would most definitely stay here again and/or recommend to a friend. Also, parking was very doable, with either street parking or in a relatively cheap paid parking garage a block away. "
1633986,33804396,2015-06-01,31367929,Jonathan,"We felt very welcomed when we entered the airbnb.  The place was spotless.  The folder of suggestions from Jesse was very useful for local suggestions and the rules of the house.  The complimentary nespresso pods and microbrews were a nice touch.  

We were able to walk everywhere from the apartment and it was right in the area I was expecting/hoping for.  The views were spectacular for a great view of the city.  When we went out in Capitol Hill we were within a couple blocks of everything.  When we went out to do Touristy things, everything was either within a 10 minute walk or a $5 Uber.  

"
1633986,34433757,2015-06-08,17780836,Maria,"This apartment was great. Light filled and very inviting. Exactly as it appears in the pictures. Kitchen is small, so if lots of cooking is your thing, it can be tough. But the kitchen was outfitted perfectly... just tiny. Communicating about check-in, etc was very easy. Jesse left a great set of notes about the apt and the neighborhood that was very useful. The neighborhood is FANTASTIC! An easy walk to downtown if you need to be there for business... but truly there is no need to ever leave Capital Hill. Endless stream of fantastic bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Loved our stay. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
1633986,35544380,2015-06-20,7065195,Christian,"The apartment was really nice and (like the whole building) had a very comfortable feel.  We really enjoyed the spectacular views out of the kitchen and living room windows at all times of day, and the fact the place is well lit.  (The kitchen area feels kind of small, especially if two people are trying to cook together or cook and do dishes at the same time.)

The location of the apartment is great: walking distance to many places on Capitol Hill and at the same time only a few minutes from the Washington State Convention Center (and a few more from Pike Place Market).  It's easy to get there from the airport by light rail and bus, and bus connections to the farther parts of Capitol Hill or to the University District are good.  (The extension of the Light Rail and the Capitol Hill Streetcar will soon make getting around even easier, I suppose.)

Getting the key for the apartment worked out well even though Jesse was not in town.  The directions about the apartment and the neighborhood that he provided were helpful, and any further questions were answered very quickly.

Overall, we really enjoyed staying in Jesse's place and were sad to have to leave it (and Seattle) after spending nine days there ‚Ä¶"
1633986,37394138,2015-07-06,23501807,Birte & Christian,"Seattle by Jesse has just been a great experience, a very nice apartment with a nice cozy atmosphere and with a good view.   The location is ideal to go everywhere.    There are many very nice restaurants close by; also it is a few steps of the new concept of Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting room.  Jesse has shown incredible flexibility to help us to check in and out.  We enjoyed our stay and can only encourage anyone who is looking for a nice place to stay by Jesse.  "
1633986,38643649,2015-07-17,1459220,Geraldine,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Jesse's apartment in Capitol Hill.  Jesse was very prompt in answering questions and making sure we had all the information we needed to access the apartment. The apartment's location was absolutely fantastic - in the heart of trendy Capitol Hill, with tons of restaurants, bars, shops etc. 

The apartment itself was on the top floor of a historical looking building and would have had great views except there was a lot of construction going on (seems like Seattle is having a major construction boom -- every street had a new building going up!)  The rooms were super clean and the decor very charming. Thank you so much for having us Jesse!"
1633986,39588154,2015-07-24,12475325,Charity,"I recommend staying here based on location and convenience. There are many restaurants and bars within the surrounding blocks. We did not have interaction with Jesse as the property is managed by Pillow Homes. This was not a problem because response time was almost instant - great for us because we were needing a place to stay at the very last minute. We booked at 8pm and stayed for just one night. Jesse left a booklet of information on the table that was quite welcoming to guests. The apartment has great views, feels very lived in, and is charmingly old."
1633986,40525902,2015-07-31,20237476,Randy,"Jesse and his Pillow team made everything smooth and easy.  Everything was provided -- as a frequent business traveler I was impressed with the space, the locale and the transaction process.  Well done!"
1633986,42007285,2015-08-10,36082078,Noah,"Jesse replied very promptly to our rental request. He was then very welcoming prior to our arrival and checked in often to ensure we had everything we needed for our stay. The space was very well-kept and quaint, and had amazing skyline views.  Great neighborhood with easy access to many great restaurants and bars. "
1633986,42442911,2015-08-13,12007024,Michael,"Amazing central location in Cap Hill. Well appointed apartment, very clean and organized with personal touches. Exactly as described. Jesse was super communicative and very easy to work with. As mentioned in a previous review, there is a bldg going up across the street and noise can be loud starting around 730am if you leave the windows open.

Only real complaint is difficulty of parking. A street permit does not come with the apt, so given rules for both garage and on-street non-permit parking, it is really difficult to park overnight. If you have a car, you'll be moving it constantly and need to think very carefully about when you'll use the car. It's doable but would be much easier with a permit. 

Still a great apt and great host."
1633986,42902506,2015-08-16,264770,Emmanuelle,"Awesome appartment!
Delicious area :)
Coolest host ;)"
1633986,44017192,2015-08-23,10196221,Lisa,"Jesse's place is absolutely lovely. It's was charming, centrally located, and made me feel right at home. I can't wait to stay again the next time I'm in town. "
1633986,45133394,2015-08-31,20256116,Laura,"We had a great experience staying at Jesse's place. The living room and kitchen offer a really nice view of the city and Space Needle. The location was perfect, near lots of great cafes and restaurants. We ended up spending most of our time in Capitol Hill and really loved the neighborhood. Would highly recommend this place!"
1633986,46040021,2015-09-07,12740469,Erika,We enjoyed our stay! Great views.
1633986,46345093,2015-09-09,6227246,Jessica,"We had a fabulous time staying at Jesse's. The apartment is right in the heart of Capital Hill, and was very clean and comfortable. The views from the apartment -both day and night - are spectacular. The building has great old-timey charm, which we really enjoyed, but we found it also means the walls are thinner than more modern buildings. Wasn't an issue for us at all, but may be something for others to keep in mind. We would definitely stay with Jesse again in the future. "
1633986,46671427,2015-09-12,13227514,Hidemi,"The team was very communicative throughout which I appreciate! There was wet towels left in the bathroom but whatever. It was great and close to all restaurants! Thanks, Jesse!"
1633986,47090799,2015-09-15,3793303,Lindsay,"We loved this place! Great central location in Capitol Hill. Close to great cafes and restaurants, awesome neighborhood. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Jesse was quick to respond and made us feel welcome in his home. Would highly recommend this place!"
1633986,47553081,2015-09-20,2202343,Stef,"You want to stay here for the location.   Trust me.  It was hands-down, my favorite thing about the apt.  We were able to walk to pretty much everything that we needed to do.  The views are also really nice.   It's on the 7th floor, but don't worry, there's an elevator.   The apt was also really clean!

As an amateur mountaineer, it was also nice to see the things that Jesse had in his home; although I didn't get to meet him, I felt I got a sense of the person he is from the stuff in his apt. 

Would absolutely stay here again. "
1633986,50392939,2015-10-11,45827464,William,"A very nice 1 bedroom in a fantastic location.  An easy walk to Pike's Market, downtown shopping, and public transit.  Would definitely stay again.  "
1633986,50850031,2015-10-15,1787667,Joe,"We really enjoyed staying at Jesse's apartment and would definitely recommend it. It is exactly as it appears in the photographs, on the top floor (there's an excellent elevator) with amazing views of the Seattle skyline. And the location is great - lots of amazing bars, coffee shops, restaurants etc. within easy walking distance. "
1633986,51472954,2015-10-20,17894374,Oscar,"The apartment was amazing, and the view was even better. Located in Capitol Hill and very close to downtown, the apartment is surrounded by great restaurants and bars. 

I was very please the this place. If back in Seattle, I would definitely stay there again. "
1633986,54190086,2015-11-16,19536289,Jed,Jesse's place was extremely clean and charming; we had a great time exploring the area from such a central and convenient (to great food and to the rest of the city) location. All the practical arrangements were handled seamlessly and so we were able to truly enjoy our time getting to know Seattle. 
1633986,55943459,2015-12-07,2880491,Todd,"Jesse is an amazing host! He was quick to respond to any questions and made me feel welcome on my trip. His apartment his clean, comfortable, and in an amazing location. Tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance. 

If you're staying in Seattle I highly recommend staying here."
1633986,57679614,2015-12-28,20436929,Larry,The apartment was just as the pictures showed.  Nice sized space with good views of the city.  It is located in a great spot right on the edge of downtown.  We were able to walk to the market and many other sites of the city.  It is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood which is a very eclectic mix of bars and restaurants and good night life.
1633986,58405955,2016-01-02,5680873,Carla,"One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. The place itself was absolutely beautiful: the views, the openness, and the amount of light that filled the entire space. Of course, location is key, and it was perfect for our stay and what we wanted to do. It was just a few minutes from downtown and the neighborhood had so many cool restaurants! Overall, it was incredible stay ;) "
4520099,24998808,2015-01-04,4343906,Yesica,"Staying at Lana's was great! The hallway leading into the apartment is old and may mislead you into thinking that the apartment is equally as unkempt, but don't be fooled! The interior is beautiful, and you can tell Lana put a lot of thought into decorating the space. Definitely recommend!!!"
4520099,38788837,2015-07-18,6491749,Elizabeth,"We had a lovely stay here. Lana left us some recommendentations on things to do and places to go.
We used the local bus alot to get around, as we did not have a car, which was very easy.
Lana had also been very clear about renovations in her building so we knew what to expect during our stay."
4520099,39190462,2015-07-21,10643883,Nicole,"Arrived to find an apartment on the lower west side of Queen Anne with views of Interbay (15th ave. west), the train tracks, and Magnolia hill.. The building is undergoing what I would call a major, not a minor, renovation at this time. Apartment is west-facing, so we found the space stuffy  to be quite honest. Also, the construction, being loud with hammering and nail guns starting at 7:30 am forced us to leave for one full day of our stay between the hours of 7:30-4:30."
4520099,39685583,2015-07-25,37184709,William,"Lana's condo is in a great area, and is clean and comfortable. The sofa is large and comfortable for sleeping an extra person."
5487934,32464116,2015-05-18,26428519,Fabian,Gem√ºtliches Zimmer mit eigenem Bad in einer gro√üen Wohnung mit Balkon. Alles bestens. Louise war eine nette Gastgeberin. Gerne Wieder.
5487934,40021203,2015-07-27,37933955,Rifat,"Louise was a fantastic host. She was quick to respond to my emails and very easy to communicate with. She offered cereal and eggs for breakfast which was very nice. You can see views of the lake from the kitchen, living room, and outside patio. It was neat to eat breakfast and watch as some small sea planes take off and land in the water (you can't hear them at all). The bed was comfortable and I had my own bathroom. The location of her place is a short walk from Fremont or a cheap and short uber ride $5 to $10 downtown or capital hill. "
670009,28473894,2015-03-24,16427437,Blake,"Qing was a good host. The place wasn't anything special, but it was functional for the amount of people we had in the place. "
670009,28825367,2015-03-30,29278038,Sharon,My guests felt very welcomed in the space. The neighborhood was perfect for their stay because it was just a few blocks from where they were rehearsing and they were able to walk down to Capital Hill for the entire Seattle experience. 
670009,29921957,2015-04-14,11124501,Julia,There is a manager which is really nice. The entrance is on the side of the house which I wasn't aware of. It was perfectly suitable for my family. It's in a very good area if your at a conference. $5 uber to the conference centre! 
670009,30410860,2015-04-21,30403636,Alisa,"Communication before arriving was somewhat vague but all the information needed was provided before we arrived.  The house was definitely comfortable for the 6 people we brought.  I would say it wasn't immaculately clean but not necessarily dirty.  Very bare but the basics were supplied (towels, soap, toilet paper). Great place for a quick stay. "
670009,32636191,2015-05-19,13346664,Jose,Nice part of town very walkable.
670009,35783769,2015-06-22,2436029,Jayson,The whole place was clean and organized. We got in with no problem and had no issues contacting Qing with any questions. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again next time we're in Seattle!
670009,36763324,2015-07-01,7556666,Carson,"We were welcomed quite nicely, and were given several recommendations for places to go, and things to see during our visit. 

It was uncharacteristically hot for Seattle during our visit, so we called to see if there was a fan for our room. The host showed up within a couple of hours with a large fan for us. "
670009,41217041,2015-08-05,35504456,Anna,House was not as nice as it looked in the pictures. No AC either. 
670009,41632900,2015-08-08,17686554,Patrick,"I stayed at this location for three nights with my wife and her parents.   On the whole we had a good experience, there were lots of pluses but also a few serious minuses.  Depending on what you're in Seattle for and what your expectations are I'd recommend staying at this location.

On the pluses:
The apartment was very spacious, which was great for us.  And there was a lot of really beautiful natural light.  The location was good, very close to downtown (a reasonable walk or very cheap Uber ride).  The patios were also nice (though one had some kind of animal infestation so we didn't really use it).  It was also really nice having a caretaker on site (especially when the power failed and she had the keys to the basement so could flip the fuse).  She was really really friendly.

On the minuses:
We'd hoped to use the kitchen to cook; but that wasn't really possible.  There were plates, mugs, and silverware.  But there were no bowls, pots, pans, knives, or utensils (ladle, spatula, etc).  So if you plan to cook I'd recommend bringing those.  The sheets and towels were provided which was great, but they were all rather old and uncomfortably musty.  The building had a lot of character, but it also needed some serious maintenance.  The shower curtain kept falling down and we couldn't get it back up.  Not having a smoke alarm felt kind of sketchy.  And there was no A/C  or ceiling fans (we were there in August, but Seattle is normally much cooler).

On the whole we really enjoyed our stay, but the place could do with some improvements."
670009,42110758,2015-08-11,16471493,Jen,"I recently stayed in the unit with 6 people total.  There was plenty of room for us, but not enough towels or blankets.  The neighborhood was very convenient - there was a bus right to downtown or Ubers were always only 5 minutes away and it was very affordable to get around that way.  There are restaurants and bars .5 to 1 miles away that are easy to walk to.  There were a lot of amenities, like a/c, but it worked out since we weren't spending a lot of time in the house.  The wifi was reliable. 
"
670009,45367866,2015-09-02,14482950,Joshua,"Well the place was under construction when we arrived, it was lacking wash cloths and had a limited number of towels. the place was dusty and had no cookware. the wifi was not in our apartment and could not reset it when it stopped working."
670009,48692245,2015-09-28,2494296,Eric,"These are all facts: 
1. This is not a review for Sunny 3BDhome, but rather ""Fantastic View"", Qing's other property. That is because the day before we were to check in, we were given the address to ""Fantastic View"". When I pointed out the mistake, Qing informed us he had moved us due to repairs, acted like he was doing us a favor and asked if we wanted to cancel. We really had no other choice but to accept even though it was another part of the city.
2. On the last night we were staying there, we came home at 2am. We were listening to music and talking. It wasn't party music but it was likely too loud for 2am. Definitely our fault. The person who lives there normally, was staying below. She came to our door and yelled at us at around 2:20am. We immediately turned off the music, apologized profusely and went to bed. Dead silence in the house. At 4am, we received a text message from the caretaker demanded we immediately leave her house (not Qing's so don't know what's going on there). We explained it was 4am and had nowhere to go and once again apologized. She again demanded we leave, contacted Airbnb, threatened to call the police and generally acted unstable. We agreed to exit but needed to get our things in order and finally left around 7:20am. During that time she came into the apartment and was unhinged (on video) screaming at us (broken English). We were polite during this entire crazy middle of the night escapade.
3. After checking out, later that day, we got a demand for $420 damage we had done. Pictures were provided by the host as proof of damage. What the pictures show is the cheap plastic bar lock for the sliding door leading to the patio. During our stay we had gone out onto the patio. This bar lock had a screw that fell out as we tried to unlock it, or remove it to go out onto the patio (a bar lock prevents people coming in from outside). It fell out because it was cheap and well worn. If we had a screwdriver we could have fixed it. If the host has a screwdriver they could fix it. Instead, in an act of retribution for 15-20 of loud music that was politely and immediately shut off, Qing has attempted to extort us for $420. That is unresolved but I hope Airbnb does the right thing.
4. The hand soap in the bathroom was full of soapy water, I guess to maximize the life of the soap like my mom used to do. "

4190771,22086348,2014-10-29,8987088,Maggie,This apartment is beautiful and we really enjoyed our experience.  It is walking distance to many great restaurants and shops (and the market) and it is exactly as advertised.  We would definitely stay here again if back in Seattle. 
4190771,27336072,2015-03-02,26803193,Harold,"Everything was as advertised.  We walked in, felt right at home."
4190771,28385815,2015-03-23,24051685,Thai,"We were very please upon arriving at the unit. The unit was clean and updated, the view of the city was amazing, and the location was very central; it was more than we could have expected. Communication with the host could not have gone smoother. We'd definitely say here again! "
4190771,44803465,2015-08-29,39290118,Dibash,"The place spectacular. The view was amazing. The rooms were all clean. Furniture were modern. Overall the experience was spectacular. I loved the environment as well. Many tourist attractions walking distance, allowed us to skip on car rental as it was not necessary. The only improvement I would like to see in the future is for the apartment to have good wifi coverage through the rooms. Currently from my experience, the wifi signal was very weak into master bedroom. Furthermore, I did see some lag when multiple people were utilizing the wifi. Being a techy, that was important to me. For the most part this place was gorgeous and I would recommended future visitors to stay here. "
7954781,54213167,2015-11-16,27068054,Samuel,Had a great time. Awesome location. Right in the middle of everything. Shane was great and answered every question I had. Great experience. 
59827,158093,2010-12-24,205970,Blair,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Urban Oasis Condo the week before Christmas 2010. We chose this property from the many listed in Seattle based on the profile on AirBnB and we weren't disappointed.

First the good things:
Darik and Sally were very professional and efficient: we knew how to get to the building (although the directions were from the south and we were coming from the north), we had explicit instructions on what to do once we got there and what to do upon leaving -- all before leaving our home.
The suite was very clean, simple, comfortable, tastefully decorated and, geographically, was at the centre of things. Although we drove to do a bit of shopping, we walked for everything else. There were plenty of pubs and restaurants within walking distance (try the Sky Lounge for drinks, skip the Two Bells Tavern).
The building was clean and well kept. Although we read reviews on this site that said the area around the building wasn't safe, we certainly never felt that way no matter the time of day or night. We didn't get up on the deck while visiting; it closes at 10pm and we arrived at 10:05. Likewise, we didn't use the games room although it looked very comfortable.
The kitchen is very well stocked for the meals you're likely to prepare on your trip. We ate breakfast in the suite, prepared a few lunches and the final dinner before departure. We didn't find anything we needed that was missing from the kitchen.
The wireless Internet service was good. I did a bit of work remotely and we made several VoIP calls without any problems.

A few things that weren't as good as they could have been but weren't horrible:
My girlfriend is a light sleeper and I like to sleep with the window open. Of our four nights in the suite, she had trouble sleeping on two of them because of the noise outside (there's a firehall a few blocks away and the sirens can be loud). I'm a deep sleeper and wasn't bothered by the noise at all so, you're mileage may vary.
The bed is very firm. Again, this wasn't an issue for us, but, if you need a soft bed, this might pose a problem. Also, it's a double bed, not a queen.
The suite isn't as big as the pictures make it seem. Although it was very comfortable for two, it would, in my opinion, be cramped for three or more.

In summary, we would stay at the Urban Oasis again in a heart beat. The few negative points were minor and were far outweighed by the positive things we experienced."
59827,179325,2011-02-07,199080,Jason,Great apartment - clean and very well maintained. Darik and Sally were both very helpful which helped to make our stay particularly pleasant. The apartment is located in a fun part of town with great restaurants and music. Highly recommended!
59827,307765,2011-06-11,114352,Sumit,The apartment was very clean and instructions (once we got into the unit) straight forward. Wifi and TV connections are a great add. We were there with our 18month old and really enjoyed it.
59827,401772,2011-07-28,310594,Debz,"Had a wonderful stay, everything you could want is here in this condo. Location is the best, walk to all attractions easily, we had a car but didn't use it once. Would recommend!!"
59827,667483,2011-10-26,347632,Jed,"Nice location to explore Seattle Downtown without a car. It is easy to walk to the waterfront, ferry terminal, Seattle center etc. The roof deck was a great place for our 2 yo to run around. That is the good part.

The place was clean when we arrived, but apparently, we never got entered as staying there in the rental agency computer. A cleaning person came in the middle of our stay to collect some sheets that were in the washing machine, and was surprised that we were there.

A number of light bulbs were out when we arrived. Calls, emails, and texts to the host were not returned. Finally, we got someone at the main rental property office and there were surprised that we were in the unit since we weren't on the calendar. The lack of attention to our stay put a damper on our stay. (One upside was that it was easier to request a  late check-out). But, based on other reviews, I'm guessing that our stay was an anomaly. 

A note for those travelling with younger children, there is no kitchen table, but a bar with high stools and some collapsible ""tv dinner"" tables that can be used with a couch.

59827,1149659,2012-04-18,1824362,Anthony - Anna,"Derik and the staff @ Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals are the consummate Rental agency in Seattle providing a 5 STAR quality experience in a homely yet urban atmosphere.  Communication was seamless throughout the entire experience -- at times it was concierge like .  Location was fabulous as it is virtually center stage (and walking) distance to ALL of the main Seattle attractions/shopping/nightlife.  Water front Views from this location were very nice and even better from the upper terrace.  Enjoyed the fitness room, pool, spa, interior courtyard and many more unmentionables.  Parking was indoors and secure with easy access to the elevators.  The interior was nicely appointed with everything you could ever want and need down to a lint remover and umbrellas..  They provide you with an impeccable (and most impressive) GUIDE book that literally covers everything from the location of the nearest hospital/drug/grocery stores to best recommended restaurant/attractions/entertainment by budget class.  I highly recommend the ‚Äú1 Bedroom Fantastic View Oasis‚Äù experience ‚Äì you will not regret it.."
59827,1428728,2012-06-06,2451573,Andrius,"The apartment was in a great location. Very close to many great places to eat and very easy to get to most attractions (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc). Also, the provided parking was greatly helpful and easy to access. If I were to revisit Seattle I'd consider booking again."
59827,1593023,2012-06-30,1746919,Stuart,"I must say it was a good experience, and the unit was very well stocked with kitchen and incidental items. Location is very good for walking the whole downtown area. Light rail from airport was excellent and convenient to the unit. Darik provides good instruction on transportation and was accommodating on arrival arrangements. A really good alternative to a hotel as it allows your to cook and to travel light.  Washer/dryer was great."
59827,1620911,2012-07-03,365260,Carmen,"The condo was perfect. My parents and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It is quite close to everything- the market, the space needle, EMP, lots of shopping and fantastic restaurants. There is a very informative binder in the condo with great suggestions, too. The accommodations were excellent, clean and the building is very secure. We especially enjoyed the rooftop to hangout and enjoy a coffee or glass of wine. It was also nice to have a space to park the car in the garage since cheap downtown parking is hard to come by. 

Darik and Sarah of Seattle Oasis were very nice and the check-in and check-out process was super easy. They made us feel welcomed and comfortable during our stay and were available for any and all questions that I had. Both Darik and Sarah are true professionals and provided stellar customer service. Thank you again for such a lovely place to stay!"
59827,2176455,2012-09-03,2325753,Mel,"Checking in was very easy, everything was explained thoroughly, and we had everything we needed in the condo. I called for help a few times (to change parking arrangements) and the customer service was spot on. The bed was SUPER comfy and we had plenty of bedding, Wi-Fi worked without any issues, the place was very clean, and there were more ammenities than what we used in the building. The building is closer to the convention center than I expected -- great place to stay for PAX. The only challenge is the shower -- it seems to be a bit of a puzzle to get the shower going :P"
59827,3232919,2013-01-02,70919,Andrea And Mike,"The unit was immaculate and the amenities of the building were an added bonus. We loved the location, a bit of a walk to some Seattle attractions, but we took several taxis and they were very reasonably priced. 

We had a bit of trouble getting our check-in instructions...after booking and  getting a confirmation email we were told to await our check-in instructions, which never arrived. When I called to inquire, there had been a glitch in the automatic system, so they were not immediately aware of our reservation. Eventually it all got sorted out and we enjoyed our stay!"
59827,50648020,2015-10-13,6454365,Cathy,"Fantastic stay at Darik's apartment! We had a bunch of pain-in-the-neck requests before we arrived which Darik was super accommodating of. It really felt very full-service and communication was always quick and helpful. The apartment was exactly as described neat, clean, and stocked with everything we needed and more. My husband and I slept on the pull-out couch while our toddler took the master (I know, I know...). But it was definitely the most comfortable pull-out I have ever slept on, maybe even more comfortable than the 'real' bed! There was a nice welcome basket when we arrived which we took advantage of, and also enjoyed eating dinner on the lovely roofdeck. A wonderful first trip to Seattle. Thanks Darik!"
59827,56961005,2015-12-20,1227856,Mikalai,Its a good place to stay. The location on the Airbnb site is off from where the actual address is. There is amazing bakery one block away run by real french people - Parisian.

7499506,44043277,2015-08-23,131098,Justin,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is located on the ground floor (down the stairs around the side of the house) with a private entrance from the backyard, so we had access to a nice deck and well taken care of yard. The yard is shielded from the neighbors by large trees on all sides. The apartment was clean, the queen bed was comfortable, and the kitchen had a bunch of complimentary goodies (cereal, bananas, milk, yogurt, tea)! We also had our own parking spot in the driveway.

Rebecca was a great hostess: she was very responsive through Airbnb messages and provided clear instructions on how to find the house and get into the apartment; she made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay and provided everything we needed; there is even a binder in the apartment with up to date information about weather, transportation, recommended restaurants and activities, etc.

We would love to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
7499506,44391059,2015-08-25,39774829,Randy,"Lovely place nestled in the hillside of west Seattle and near downtown.  Rebecca was always quick to respond to any needs we had.  We enjoyed the organic milk, yogurt and bananas for breakfast-it was nice not having to go out and forage for breakfast!"

Due to our circumstances both our arrival date and departure needed to be flexible and she was so responsive, hospitable and accommodating. We have stayed at 4-5 AirBNB in the Seattle area and (not to take anything away from them) Becky‚Äôs place was the best. It is secluded yet so central and very quiet. We would recommend her place highly and will check it first when we have visitors come to town."

7985714,48212690,2015-09-24,3231147,Ashley,This is a house of very intelligent men.  The conversations are very heady and I appreciate it for that reason.
2746782,12035523,2014-04-21,13510128,Andean,"Jean-Marc suite garage was the perfect accommodation for my visit. I found it very sufficient, and more importantly comfortable. Nice comfy bed, hot shower with  great pressure, and a heater that kept the suite warm.   
Jean was great to communicate with as well: I never told him how I was texting what I thought was my friends 206#, but it was him!  I didnt realize it until after the fact because he's just that personable and friendly that it felt like I knew him, I didn't figure it out until it was too late :)
I will definitely look to stay here again for my upcoming Seattle visits!"
2746782,12169058,2014-04-24,10798226,Shona,"Suite Garage is a perfect description for this lovely apartment built by the owner, Jean-Marc himself.  He did such a great job in transforming what used to be a garage into a very ""sweet"" apartment rental.  It has everything a person would need such as a comfy bed and sheets, clean new bathroom, and a small kitchen area. 
As soon as I arrived Jean-Marc or Jay as he likes to be called, was waiting there for me.  We immediately hit it off with conversation and I felt right at home!  He told me where services were located close by and said if I needed anything to please let him know.  I felt like I knew him for years.  There were even chickens and gardens in the backyard just like I have in my own home...
Thank you so much.  I'm glad to know you, Jay, and will stay there again if I ever return to the Seattle area.  :-)  Shona"
2746782,12304346,2014-04-28,14204092,Anthony,"We had such a lovely stay at this quaint and cute hideaway! Jay was super cool. He was waiting to greet us and give us a mini tour of the place when we arrived. The room was very clean, well-thoughout and Jay had done all the work converting this former basement/garage into a clean and comfortable getaway, complete with it's own little patio area to enjoy! Loved the neighbourhood and the   free-ranging chickens and gypsy wagons in the backyard! We look forward to staying again! Highly recommend this hidden gem!"
2746782,12477900,2014-05-03,7173455,Ryan,"J and Maggie were great hosts. Checking in and out was very easy and the garage apartment was a nice place to hole up in for a few days. The bed was incredibly comfy and the ambient lighting was very relaxing. There is a bus stop just a 30
second walk away and the Ballard area has lots of cool bars and restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle."

2746782,13423535,2014-05-27,13599580,Anthony,Jean-Marc's place was exactly as described and comfortable for my girlfriend and I! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy place in a great location. He even provided us with some snacks after our flight arrived later than expected!
2746782,13577826,2014-05-31,14869803,Kimberly,"This is a great place to stay! Jay was an amazing host and the location can't be beat. During the day we took the bus into downtown, and at night took the same bus the other direction into Ballard for food and drinks. Don't even think about it... Just book your stay with Jay. Trust me. You will not regret it."
2746782,13917414,2014-06-08,14485015,Alex & Rosa,Jean-Marc was a great and very friendly host! His Suite Garage was the perfect place to stay when visiting Seattle. It was very comfortable and clean.

The apartment is in a great location, street parking is pretty easy and its close to downtown area and Kerry Park. Bed was comfortable, water pressure in the shower was great too. I would use this place again for sure next time im in Seattle. "
2746782,14395591,2014-06-18,11374799,Liza,What a great first-time experience with Airbnb! The accommodations are absolutely perfect; everything was just as described and the neighborhood was very safe. I was so impressed by how spotlessly clean the space was. Jean-Marc and his family were so warm and inviting. He is a very talented craftsmen! We had a great chat when we first arrived and offered us complete privacy for the rest of our stay. I hope I get to visit again one day. P.S. Super comfy bed + pillows = one well rested traveler!
2746782,14529537,2014-06-21,15974898,Matthew,"What a wonderful experience! Jean-Marc and his family were delightful, and the room was excellent. Clean, quiet and comfortable. We had our two little boys with us, and they loved playing in the back yard and visiting the bunny and chickens.

The location, right on the bus line to Ballard and downtown, was convenient. We walked one day to Seattle Center, which was a bit of a walk, but doable.

We'd highly recommend Jean-Marc's place, and we'll stay here again if we get a chance. "
2746782,14777780,2014-06-26,3539716,Dan,"Jean-Marc's place was perfect.  Clean, a nice comfy bed (to sleep in after the long travel day!) and close to downtown and other areas.  Would use again."

Perfect location, especially if you have a rental car. Many good exercise routes for those that like stair stepping. I felt completely welcomed in Jeans home and my stay was excellent. Clean and such a comfortable bed. Thank you, if you will have me, I will definitely be back in the future! "
2746782,15179634,2014-07-04,15279201,Erin,"Staying with Jean Marc was nothing short of wonderful.  Both he and his wife were both accommodating (as far as out housing needs) and beyond friendly in terms of our comfort.  The description was 100% accurate with regard to the structure as well as the summary of terms.  Jean Marc, by no means had to be so welcoming and friendly.  He just is, and it's a wonderful bonus.  His fabricating craftsmanship is both well-done and creative.  When staying for a week, we found our unit to be cozy, quite and non cluttered filled.  This in addition to being conveniently close to downtown Seattle.  We had such a wonderful time.  This in large part to Jean Marc and his family.  I highly recommend this place and Jean Marc as a host!  Thanks again!   "
2746782,15257277,2014-07-06,13751612,Joanna,Jean-Marc was an excellent host. When we arrived he was very friendly and took the time to show us around and talk to us about the area. The apartment is brand new and very clean. There are bus stops right by the house which made getting around easier too. We stayed for 2 nights and slept great in the very comfy bed.
2746782,15462107,2014-07-09,16396243,Bryn,"Met J as soon as we get there, he was nice and polite, showed us the space, and that was it. My friend and are are early risers and late nighters so we were out most of the 2 days we spent there so that was all we saw of J. Place was nice, clean, bed was comfy. We had a car so parking wasn't an issue, however there is a bus stop right there. "
2746782,15549053,2014-07-11,17212382,Kym,"Jean-Marc met us as soon as we pulled up on our motorcycles. We were tired, but his warm welcome made us feel right at home. He explained all that we needed to know about the place and how to get around the area either by public transportation or on our bikes. 
The place was cozy, clean, and a 10-min bus ride got us right to downtown. We would definitely stay here again.  "
2746782,15758954,2014-07-15,15544151,Angie,"I absolutely loved staying here! I was in Seattle for work and the location couldn't have been better. I just hopped on the bus that stops less than a block away and took it downtown in 10 minutes. Jean-Marc was friendly when I arrived and gave me a great recommendation for burgers down the street. The garage suite is super nice, clean, and quaint. I'll definitely try to stay here next time i'm in town. Thanks so much!"
2746782,15886668,2014-07-17,17675945,Allison,"Our host was very welcoming, and the suite was exactly as it looked in the pictures. The neighbourhood was  a little more industrial than I imagined but very easy to get to the ballard area and to downtown by bus."
2746782,16064371,2014-07-21,9491802,Birgit,"We had a lovely stay! What struck us the most was how CLEAN the suite was. Everything worked like a charm and we felt very safe. Also, Jean-Marc is a wonderful host. He was very (!) responsive, friendly, but at the same time also respected our privacy wonderfully. 
Although the suite is close to a main road, we did not have any trouble with noise in the suite. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is  equipped with a great working (and quiet!) fridge, microwave, coffeemaker... everything you would need! I highly recommend this accommodation to anyone traveling to Seattle and who wants to explore the city without parking trouble where they stay and it is only a short 5-10 minute drive into the city center. "
2746782,16403821,2014-07-27,15326198,Aurelie And Julien,Nous avons ete tres bien recus. La chambre est tres bien situe et tres facilement accessible du centre et du space needle par deux bus directs. Nous recommandons vivement cet endroit. MERCI.
2746782,16585008,2014-07-29,18362444,Joshua,"Jean-Marc and Maggie were perfect hosts! Upon arriving, they immediately made us feel welcome and showed us around their lovely property. My niece and I met the entire family and really got to know a little bit of their family's history. All I can say is, ""Wow, Jean-Marc, your story is truly an inspiration and what you have built there at the property is unbelievable!""

As for the property itself, it is in a great location with easy access to everything downtown. Our suite garage was an outstanding room complete with a small kitchen, refrigerator, microwave, private bathroom, and an extremely comfortable bed. For the price, it can't be beat, and we will definitely look to stay there for future visits."
2746782,16675037,2014-07-31,4983096,Juliana,"This place was great! Exactly what we were looking for. Great location to get into downtown. Easy parking and completely private! Jean-Marc, his wife and his daughter were great! Loved the animals and talking with then for the little time we did. Thanks again! "
2746782,16780595,2014-08-02,665856,Charles,"Great location.  Convenient to bus and Whole Foods.  Jay was very friendly and helpful.  We would have liked a TV and a radio.  Also, I missed having a mirror over the sink for shaving "
2746782,17043834,2014-08-06,15692688,Drew,We loved our stay in the suite garage.  Jay and his wife are so welcoming.  They have built a wonderful place and invite everyone in to enjoy it.  I will look to stay here first on any future trips to Seattle.
2746782,17166583,2014-08-08,17994039,Michael,"Perfect first airbnb stay!  J was friendly, hospitable and overall awesome.  Garage suite was exactly as advertised.  Definitely would be first choice for next trip to Seattle!"
2746782,17501404,2014-08-13,8652148,Russell,Jean-Marc was an excellent host. Everything was clean and easy to find. Would definitely stay here again. 
2746782,17713789,2014-08-16,3959877,Tyler,"Jean-Marc's garage suite was fantastic. Centrally located in Seattle and great interior! We loved the view from the hill over the sound and the authentic Seattle feel of the house, yard and Neigborhood in Queen Ann! Jean was very nice and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again!"
2746782,17930522,2014-08-19,15569609,Mac,"""J"" was a great host, made us feel very welcome and the garage suite was great.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants an easy drive to downtown and pretty much anywhere else in Seattle - it's a great convenient location just off 15th, perfect for singles or couples (the bathroom is separated with a curtain, which might make things awkward if you're not terribly close). The bed was comfy and everything was great - a coffee pot in the room and a nice little patio to sit and drink it on, while watching the mist roll off the hills.  The property has lots of fun stuff on it (rabbits, chickens, etc.), but the garage is self-contained and has everything you need.  "
2746782,18318961,2014-08-25,17430025,Stan,"JM greeted us on arrival. The location is great, with a Whole Foods and bus stop within easy walking distance. The Suite Garage is a very nice space, along with the host's other AirBnB rooms in the same (website hidden) was easy to contact, responsive to text messages, and generally available. 

Great and unique listing, responsive host. Recommended. "
2746782,18524908,2014-08-28,13639737,Kelsey,"The place was nice and Jean-Marc was very friendly when he came down and introduced himself. It was a nice location and a short drive to a ton of really cool locations. The only thing against this place was that it was very warm in Seattle and the room became very still and toasty at night, even with the small fan provided at the end of the room. "
2746782,18676006,2014-08-30,19736207,Randal,"Very accurate listing. New condition, well done remodel. comfortable, quiet in a great location. Would definitely return."
2746782,18874332,2014-09-02,1143900,Loren,Jean-Marc was lovely and made us feel very welcome right away.  The Suite Garage was perfect and really really clean.  The cleanest place we have stayed on AirBnB by far.  It was super convenient to downtown and nice and private.  We travel to Seattle pretty frequently and I would definitely try and stay here again.  Highly recommended.
2746782,19262150,2014-09-09,11674003,Josh,"My wife and I loved staying at Jay's Suite Garage. Jay is a fine host and took care of all our questions during out stay. And the Suite Garage is slick: cozy, comfortable, and a bit elegant. If we stay in Seattle in the future, Jay is our first choice."
2746782,19884985,2014-09-20,7702426,Kayla,"The room looked just like the pictures. It was cozy, the bed was comfortable, and it was great to have the fridge and the coffee maker. The space is a little crowded with two big chairs so there is not much room for luggage, but should work fine if you're on a short trip. The place is easy to find and easily accessible by bus. There is not much in walking distance, but we did find a good sea-food restaurant, it is easy to get downtown on the bus, and the Whole Foods is a short walk away."
2746782,20335066,2014-09-28,1016831,Jennifer,"Jean-Marc was a great host; very inviting.  We did not spend the most amount of time in the room, as we were out exploring, but it was nice and in a good part of town. "
2746782,22047161,2014-10-28,22739289,Taylor,"Jean-Marc was great, The suite was exactly as described. Quiet, clean, and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again in the future."
2746782,22374974,2014-11-04,18846929,Marta,"We had a great time staying in Jean-Marc's garage suite. The room is adorable and very clean, ample parking on the street, and bonus: one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. We'd stay here again in a second. "
2746782,22503731,2014-11-08,23032884,Brandon,"J was so kind and the ""suite garage"" was just perfect. We had a lovely time and will definitely return!"
2746782,22666056,2014-11-11,16871024,Kevin,"J was a great host. He was very helpful and accommodating to us checking in late. Room was clean and we felt right at home. The little heater they had in the room was easily able to heat the room up quickly to warm us up after a cold day. Wifi was fast too. No problem steaming Netflix. 

The place was just like the description and I would stay here again."
2746782,22988649,2014-11-19,22824373,Kevin,"We stayed in the Suite Garage for 5 nights. It was lovely. The room included many pleasant touches - a little fridge, microwave, utensils, towels, etc. This was especially nice since we were visiting from across the country. The Keurig is an especially nice touch. 

Jean-Marc was very friendly and personable. We felt welcomed, and that we could contact him for any reason, but he was completely non-intrusive, which we enjoyed. "
2746782,23337589,2014-11-29,15832086,George,This place is amazing! It's perfect to get away and relax. I'll be back for sure! Oh and the coffee maker is wonderful and the verity of flavors is so wide! Oh and the LED lighting is totally cool! 
2746782,23461229,2014-12-01,23681083,Colin,The place was very comfortable and conveniently located just north of downtown.  We had a great stay and would definitely stay here again in the future.  Jean-Marc was a wonderful host and was very helpful.
2746782,23690599,2014-12-08,817405,Teresa,"This  place was absolutely perfect for my needs!  J met me upon arrival and he is such an interesting person - we found that we have several things in common :)

I was in town to work at Seattle Center, which was less than a 10 min. drive away.  The Whole Foods is about 3 blocks away, which was great for grabbing breakfast and lunch for the road.  

I hope to stay here again! :)"
2746782,23999172,2014-12-16,3390621,Kyle,"Had a great experience, the accommodations were as advertised and comfortable.  Jean-Marc was easy to communicate with friendly."
2746782,24430720,2014-12-28,24378623,James,"Great location near everything downtown.  Not walking distance if you don't have a car, but we knew that booking and parking was easy and free - which is always a relief.  Inside, the place was exactly as presented and the bed was really nice.  We arrive on Xmas day and JM was there to greet us without any issues.  Plenty warm with the little space heater and very clean.  I would definitely rent this place again if I go back to Seattle. "
2746782,24824707,2015-01-03,428327,Jennifer,"This is the second time we have stayed at Jean-Marc's garage apartment, and will book again without hesitation!  It's cozy and clean, and the location is convenient to Ballard and downtown.  Thank you!"
2746782,25248600,2015-01-10,24662009,Adriana,"Don't be turned off by the fact that this place is a converted garage - once you cross the threshhold you'll be impressed. Nice and dark if you're used to sleeping in a cave-like environment, this is a compliment from me. Small but with everything you could might need for a short stay and great attention to detail from our host (those LED lights are seriously cool). Located in Interbay which seems like it's in the middle of nowhere, it's actually only a short walk from the D-Line bus which is a quick way to get downtown and it's close to both Queen Anne (a nice little residential area for a leisurely stroll) and a mile and some from Ballard (which has some good restaurants). The space is intimate, as in the bathroom door is a curtain, but if it's just you or you and your closest pal then this should be no problem. Jean-Marc was always available if we had any questions or problems and he is quite the handyman. "
2746782,26106443,2015-02-03,3390621,Kyle,Everything was great. Would stay here again and recommend to friends and. family.
2746782,26380679,2015-02-10,5680874,Annie,"Jean-Marc's suite was great! Great location, 5 minutes away from Ballard, our of our favorite neighbourhoods. Clean, had everything we needed. We'd love to come back. Thank you!"
2746782,27053176,2015-02-24,6243487,David,"The garage suite was great. As long as you just need a place to sleep and get ready, this is the place for you. Very clean and well maintained. We would not hesitate to stay here again. We didn't think it was the best place to situate yourself if you plan on walking to a lot of places, but it's not a far drive from many great parts of the city if you plan to rent a car or use Uber to get around."
2746782,27732005,2015-03-10,19980572,Chris,"Very accurate, very convenient."
2746782,27823338,2015-03-12,26264107,Dara,"The listing is true to the place! We only stayed one night, but it was super clean and inviting, would definitely stay here again."
2746782,28061289,2015-03-16,19309149,Janan,"What a cool place! The bathroom was so fresh, bright, and nice hot water. The bed was comfy and everything we possibly needed was provided. Our hosts even printed out our Sounders tickets for us! "
2746782,28992698,2015-04-02,19654267,Bj,"Great little space!!
I had a very pleasant stay in the Suite Garage. Although I arrived a bit late in the evening, Jean-Marc was right there to welcome me. He is a very friendly man and gave me a quick tour of my room.  He did the remodel of the garage himself and it's obvious he enjoys building.  The space is very well thought out. Everything you need to feel at home has been provided.
 Whole Foods is so close by, it was easy to pick up some good food.  
The bus service was convenient too, with the D line and #32 bus stop just down a short hill. My wait was never too long.
My family lives in the area, which was the reason for my visit. Consequently, I didn't spend a lot of time in my room, but I looked forward to coming back each night for a good rest!
I would stay here again without hesitation!
Thank you Jean-Marc and (website hidden)

2746782,29369463,2015-04-06,4324554,Yutaka,"I had a great stay with Jean-Marc.  The space, while small, was very recently renovated.  It was very clean and comfortable.  And Jean-Marc was tremendously friendly and was a great host.

All in all, a great stay!"
2746782,29531107,2015-04-08,7073824,Jess,"If you are in the Seattle area, stay with Jean-Marc!  He is an awesome human who puts a lot of work into everything that he makes. The suite garage is a perfect example of all the hard work he puts in to his projects.  The photos are extremely accurate to the actual space... A perfect place to stay for one to two people.  The space is extremely clean, comfortable, AND IT INCLUDES COFFEE! 

Thank you, Jean-Marc for allowing us to stay in your humble abode.  We will definitely be back!"
2746782,29853259,2015-04-13,11233295,Jessica,"Great little spot!  They were very nice and we were glad we stayed.  Very close to downtown and the bus made it easy to get around.  Looks like the picture, nice mini fridge and microwave love the coffee maker.  Great hosts and very accommodating.  "
2746782,30886046,2015-04-28,6164979,Shawna,"Jay was a great host and ensured we had everything we needed including an iron. The garage suite was beautiful, well kept, and clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Jay was welcoming and we enjoyed our time here and would be happy to stay again. "
2746782,30996849,2015-04-30,23534148,Rebeckah,"Great place. Clean, Cozy, and Great (website hidden) is a very responsive and resourceful host."
2746782,31347286,2015-05-04,10856876,David,"The room was exactly as expected per the pictures they posted. It was a really nice, cozy place that was perfect to relax in after a long day of exploring Seattle. The Keurig was a nice touch :). They were very responsive prior to arriving and accommodated our late arrival. Had everything we needed since we weren't cooking. Would definitely stay at again!"
2746782,31729787,2015-05-09,31220704,Marisa,"The Suite was well, Sweet!! We immediately felt at home when we walked in the door, and looked forward to returning after a long day out in Seattle. It was easy to find, convenient to transportation & food sources, and we slept great in the bed. This place is tha bomb!"
2746782,32470527,2015-05-18,21382655,Stephanie,"This was our first AirBNB experience and I must say it was an awesome experience. Jean-Marc was able to get us in early in our check in day, gave us plenty of privacy, and was available as needed. 

The Garage Suite had everything you needed in a hotel but with such a better price. The location was great for what we wanted to do in Seattle, close to Kerry Park, a bridge from Ballard and Fremont, and a quick Uber ride to downtown.

Such a great experience and can't wait to visit again!"
2746782,33106465,2015-05-25,30662834,Cecilia,"This was such a great deal! Beautiful room, great price, in a good location, with easy access to public transportation. We had everything we needed for a weekend getaway, comfortable bed, fresh towels, coffee. Jean-Marc and his family were very welcoming and even held our luggage until we had to leave for our flight. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
2746782,33468014,2015-05-28,33462460,Kelie,"This place was very clean, nicely set up (felt like a nice modern hotel), very welcoming and also private. Safe and beautiful area, cute property. Within walking distance from public transport and a whole foods, reasonable distance from down towns. Extremely pleased with our stay- would definitely stay again. "
2746782,33816622,2015-06-01,5983046,Marissa,"Jean-Marc's garage suite was awesome! It was perfect for our three days in Seattle. We liked the location as we were close to a grocery store (Whole Foods - my husband's favorite) and also the Fremont and Ballard areas. Downtown Seattle was a quick Uber or bus ride away. The bed was comfortable, and having a mini fridge to put some drinks/snacks in is a nice perk. I'd stay here again in a minute!

PS. The air conditioner/humidifier worked perfectly!"
2746782,33978494,2015-06-03,25753153,Pam,Jean-Marc was a great host.  Check in and check out were very fast and easy.  Perfect location for our Alaskan Cruise. The garage apartment was just as listed.  We will recommend to all our friends.   Thank you again Jean Marc.  From Danny and Pam Dallas Texas

"
2746782,34440750,2015-06-08,32197894,Megan,"Very cute and clean suite- exactly as pictured. It was very convenient having the fridge, microwave and coffee maker as well. We opted to walk everywhere- which was doable  Had we been there longer we would have taken advantage of the very close bus stop (right at the end of the street- maybe a 2 minute walk)."
2746782,34743895,2015-06-11,33159709,Ebonee,I enjoyed my stay! Very clean and quiet. It was exactly what I was expecting.

2746782,35086205,2015-06-15,19455410,Zena,This was a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! My friend and I were in town for the Rock n Roll 1/2 Marathon. It was close enough to the city center without being stuck in an area with inconvenient traffic or parking. We loved that there was a Whole Foods nearby. The apartment itself had everything we needed and more! Stylish and fun and the perfect amount of space for two people.
2746782,35562134,2015-06-20,32597170,Jayn√©,"Was wonderful to arrive late in the night and have the lights left on for me... felt safe and homey. LOVED the location...just steps from  a main bus line that takes you right downtown. I got yummy food at Whole Foods that is right down the street as well...and, I'm a runner and they are only a few blocks from a pedway bridge that gets you to the great waterfront trails. :) This was fantastic!  The  garage suite was super clean, inviting, had all the amenities one would need want/need. I met Jean-Marc and his family who were kind, welcoming and helpful with any questions I had. I would totally love to visit their place again if I come to Seattle in the future. The bunnies and chickens in the beautiful backyard were SO fun to see. :)"
2746782,35933543,2015-06-23,33020507,Rico,"- It was that good as expected
- very clean and cosy
- near to Downtown (by bus just 10 minutes)
- Marc is very friendly and helpful
- We would come back"

Jean Marc is an awesome host!  he has thought of everything. i HIGHLY recommend staying here."
2746782,37014520,2015-07-03,23970984,Caroline,"I didn't get to meet Jean-Marc as I wasn't able to make this trip so it was just my husband.  The Sweet Garage was perfect in every way, the trip was to work on our boat moored in nearby Ballard.  The Suite was clean, well equipped, and the bed was super comfortable. I hope to stay there next time."
2746782,37175654,2015-07-05,33444150,Nicholas,"Awesome experience!! We had a great time with our stay at this place..the place was very charming, clean and on top of that the 2 bunny's and multiple chickens out back were alot of fun. The place is conveniently located with multiple food and drink options nearby. We're already planning our next stay!"
2746782,37665121,2015-07-09,11977127,Debbie,"We enjoyed our stay. Our Jean-Marc welcomed us and was available if we needed anything, but gave us privacy. The place was quiet with a very comfortable bed and what we expected. The pictures are accurate. There was free parking near by. The location was convenient, easy to drive to popular sites. We had a very positive experience. "
2746782,38121292,2015-07-13,28180522,Anita,"We checked in very late on Friday and since we approached from the street above the property, walking down the stairway, we had to disturb Jean-Marc to make sure we had the right place. He was very gracious and welcoming.

This unit was very clean, and just as pictured. The location is quiet and private, and since we came back rather late at night, we were happy not to disturb anyone. The bed was very comfortable and was appreciated after our busy days in Seattle. Great coffee with the Keurig, and the refrigerator and microwave would have been used, but we were hardly there!"
2746782,38748106,2015-07-18,8184218,Leanne,We didn't get the chance to meet Jean-Marc but were very comfortable in the little garage suite. It was conveniently located between downtown and other neighbourhoods we were interested in exploring. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle. Access to the yard is a plus too!   
2746782,39015882,2015-07-20,3113484,Tina,We loved our stay with Jean-Marc in his Suite Garage! The location to both downtown Seattle and north to the Ballard or Freemont areas can't be beat! The accommodations were very nice and just what we needed for a couple of nights away just the two of us! The bed was very comfy and the shower had great water pressure! All the little touches in the suite were very nice! Highly recommend this location to others that are traveling to Seattle and want great accommodations and a great location!
2746782,39640392,2015-07-25,31615324,Jimena,"It was AWESOME!! Great space, very clean! They make you feel welcome before you get to the little house!! It is really near to the bus so you can move whenever you want!!! "
2746782,40088727,2015-07-28,1609879,Joanne,"The listing was very accurate.  The accommodation was very clean and neat.  Although the space is small it is very efficiently layed out and served our needs.  The location was perfect as it was just a couple of blocks from where our daughter lives and is a great starting point for walks up the hill to Queen Anne.
Jean greeted us when we first arrived but after that we really had no contact with him nor did we need to.  We surely would stay here again especially if our daughter was still living near by. Jean was also very accommodating when we had to cancel some of the dates becauser of our daughter's change in plans.  Thanks"
2746782,40505283,2015-07-31,38468300,Kristina,"Our stay was absolutely perfect! The suite garage was clean, organized, and provided privacy as well. We felt at home and our hosts were welcoming as well as willing to answer all our questions. I would definitely stay again!"
2746782,40789944,2015-08-02,2225240,Hannah,"Suite was exactly like the photos: clean, updated, and very comfortable.  Location was very convenient to Pike Place, Ballard, Golden Gardens, Kerry Park, dined at Chinook (recommended by the host), and easy to find parking. Didn't meet the host but he made it very easy to check-in/out. Would stay here again."
2746782,41079122,2015-08-04,14246787,Andrew,"Welcoming, responsive host. Well-stocked, well-maintained, clean, quiet space (nice touch with the LED lights above the bed). The convenience and location for us could not be beat. It was a quick drive from the airport and less than 2min from Whole Foods. An excellent home-base for exploring Seattle."
2746782,41924467,2015-08-10,30127677,Anita,"The Suite Garage was a great pick for my first time trying Airbnb. It was very clean and comfy. Everything was as described in the listing, including the coffee maker which is actually a very handy Keurig that includes tea and hot chocolate. Jean-Marc even includes a binder of personal recommendations of food and activities around the area. The pets in his backyard (chickens, bunny) are also very cute and he allows you to feed the chickens.

We only saw Jean-Marc once during our stay but that was completely fine since we were away most of the day. He made check in/out very convenient so we could choose whether to meet him or not. The Suite Garage is very private, which I liked. The bathroom is on the small side, with only a toilet and stand in shower. My boyfriend who is average build for 6 feet was fine with it, but your mileage may vary.

My favorite thing about the Suite Garage is that the location is extremely convenient. The D line across the street goes through Key Arena, Pike Place Market, and the downtown area in under 30 minutes."
2746782,42307479,2015-08-12,15451862,Jenn,"Jean-Marc and Maggie were wonderful hosts. The place was exactly as described only better. My son played with their lovely daughter and he pet the rabbits. We hope to come back and stay, maybe in one of the amazing gypsy wagons. Great location and great family! "
2746782,42607532,2015-08-14,29214415,Paige,The listing was accurate and JM was very helpful. The suite was clean and accommodating. The coffee was really nice in the morning and the Netflix was great!
2746782,43485432,2015-08-20,33390495,Wendy,My Son and his girlfriend stayed for a week while they visited Seattle.  I live on Queen Anne so it was a perfect location for visiting family as well as access to the city via the bus.  The room was very comfortable and we would happily recommend it to others looking for a place to see Seattle. Thanks!
2746782,44422017,2015-08-26,14047466,Mikael,"I enjoyed my stay very much. The garage was very spacious and very clean. It felt like a hotel room. 

A portable AC was provided but there was no need to use it during my stay.

Check-in and check-out was smooth. Jean-Marc was very friendly.

The area felt safe. Whole Foods Market is within walking distance.

Don't be discouraged by the distance from the touristy places. The RapidLine D bus runs 200 m from Jean-Marc's place. It runs very often and the ride is only 20 minutes to downtown."
2746782,44910645,2015-08-30,35923866,Kam,Very nice and inviting atmosphere. Not too far from the main attractions of the city and a nice quiet area to rest. Very well maintained. The lights above the bed are an especially nice choice 
2746782,45369405,2015-09-02,4285384,Becca,Place was cute and great location. Very good value. 
2746782,45946552,2015-09-07,35922316,John,"The garage suite is very nice and cozy. There's a space heater and ac so no need to worry about the climate. Very close to all the main areas. Including pikes place (a must go!), which is walkable or just a bus ride away. Also they have free Netflix,Hulu, and Amazon video accounts! Enjoy!"
2746782,47486610,2015-09-19,40641010,Manon,We had a wonderful stay!! Clean and perfect location. Will defiantly stay again!
2746782,47977375,2015-09-22,39641784,Caitlin,"What a lovely little suite! It was everything we were hoping for. Very clean, welcoming, and close to downtown. We were out and about for most of our stay but when we were at Jean-Marc's house we wee extremely comfortable. We cannot wait to return! "
2746782,48221851,2015-09-24,2255243,Mario,"Fantastic small lodging, absolutely to recommend.
It is nicely done up and very clean, even a tabel lamp shined at our arrival.
My pal and I stayed at 'Suite Garage' for two nights.
A supermarket is a few minutes away,  the bus stop just a couple of steps.
So we came easily to Seattle's downtown in 15 minutes.
We met Jean-Marc, a very kind man, once and had pleasant small talk."
2746782,48415457,2015-09-26,42325296,Tyler,The room was neat and clean.  The coffee was a nice touch.
2746782,49915796,2015-10-07,43980657,Danielle,"10/10 we will be back again! Loved the location, entire property, our room, the animals and garden.. So happy that we decided to stay here and couldn't imagine our vacation being any better! "
2746782,51316077,2015-10-19,44131689,Dave,Jean-Marc's place is great. It had everything we needed and was perfectly located for public transport to all the main attractions. They were great hosts and were even gracious enough to give us a ride to the shops on arrival to pick up some supplies. 
2746782,52062488,2015-10-26,42611774,Jessica,"I felt very welcome and the description was accurate - except - the place was even better than I expected! Additionally, communication with Jean-Marc was seamless.

The location was perfect for us. It was walking distance to Whole Foods which is something we were particularly looking for. The area is very quiet, which we also wanted, yet we were able to get very quick Uber trips (6 or 7 minutes at most) to the business of downtown Seattle, Pike Place Market, The Space Needle, etc.

The entire place is very cozy and it was perfect for the two of us. It is also VERY clean and tidy all around; (I can tell they spent a lot of time making sure every corner was cleaned up very well). Although we were out for most of the day, the television programs available were great - lots to choose from - and we had the options to either watch from the leather chairs (very comfortable) or from the bed. Speaking of the bed..... we slept like babies! And that is usually not the case when we are away from home. The bed was incredibly comfortable!

The place is so unique, and the backyard is a must-see. I can go on but overall - I had a wonderful stay. Thank you to Jean-Marc and family for being such great hosts."
2746782,53132936,2015-11-05,17834732,Danica,"We had such a great time here! Truly lovely space, very comfortable yet spacious, great set-up! Everything ran very smoothly and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!!"
2746782,55008628,2015-11-27,47442667,Maryann,"Jean-Marc was a WONDERFUL host. He is SO quick to respond and is really there if you need anything. The place was cozy, clean, warm, and super close to town. The backyard is a must go when you visit! There are bunnies  to pet and chickens to look at! The gypsy dens are quite unique as well. Definitely made our Seattle experience unique and cozy. He gave us postcards to keep and provided shampoo and soap in the bathroom as well! "
2746782,55349320,2015-12-01,40613952,Chris,J popped in as soon as we arrived.  Very welcoming and pleasant.  The suite was exactly as pictured; clean and welcoming.  The bed was pleasantly comfortable and all was as expected and described.   I would definitely stay here again.
2746782,55888977,2015-12-07,817405,Teresa,"Once again, Jean-Marc was a terrific host!  I really like staying in his garage suite!"
2746782,57776530,2015-12-29,5136527,John,This was a perfect place for my mother-in-law for a holiday stay.  Everything was great!  Jean-Marc even personally helped her to access the internet.
3124961,13592488,2014-05-31,16045780,Hosung,"Listing was exactly as expected.  Clean, spacious, quiet neighborhood with walkable distance to local shops.  Jeff wa kind enough to answer any questions and offer any help with finding what I need around the place."
762029,2820649,2012-11-05,4033220,Rick,"Maggie and Jean-Marc's Gypsy Wagon is a fun and unique option for adventurous traveler's, and for only $30, a helluva bargain in (email hidden)ggie and Jean-Marc were down-to-Earth and helpful hosts, and their three dogs very sweet.  "
762029,2870601,2012-11-12,525823,Nancy,"The wondrous world of the Gypsy Wagon! We had a marvelous weekend, full of fun based out of the Gypsy Wagon.  An easy Rapid Transit ride to downtown Seattle, as well as convenient access to the fun Ballard and Queen Anne neighborhoods, the location is also off the beaten path enough to feel unique.  
The Wagon is beautifully crafted. It feels homey, clean, playful & private.  The top bunk slept two people comfortably, with storage for gear under the lower bunk.  
Thanks to the wonderful creators of the Gypsy Wagon for being gracious, open and welcoming hosts! We'll be back when we're in Seattle again hopefully!"
762029,2923121,2012-11-19,2677175,Rachel,"A great place to stay, and great hosts! I felt very welcomed from the moment I arrived and I had an excellent one-night stay here! The wagon really is a lot of fun - incredible to see all the careful, loving work that had gone into crafting this piece of art, that you then get to sleep in! What fun! And although it's obviously small, it's roomier than I expected - I didn't feel cramped at all. Definitely a fun and unique experience! :)"
762029,2938894,2012-11-21,4160769,Linda,"Jean-marc and Maggie were helpful and easy-going.  Among other things, they approved a last minute decision to add an extra night  to the front end of our stay, and Maggie kindly took the initiative, printing a bus route from the Gypsy Wagon to Seattle Center.  We liked the selection of coffee and tea to begin each day. Two year-old Candance was a delight. 

My 8 year-old daughter and I loved the Gypsy Wagon.  It was cozy, beautiful, and a highlight of our trip, equally as apealing as seeing the King Tut exhibit, Space Needle, and other Seattle sights.  We looked forward to returning to it, laying on the beds, talking, at the end of the day,  We feel fortunate to have to stayed in this hand-crafted work of art."
762029,3099582,2012-12-16,3146268,Cara,"Fantastic people with a fantastic space to share with the world! Jean-Marc and Maggie (and their family) were wonderful hosts, made me feel right at home and comfortable during my short/busy stay in them in Seattle for some job interviews. I'm proud to be a gypsy wagon alum :) and grateful for the opportunity to stay in their beautifully constructed space. "
762029,3109765,2012-12-17,4051092,Jordana,"Me and my friend Dave came to Seattle for a weekend and were so lucky to stay in Jean-Marc beautifully hand-crafted wagon. We commented to each other several times on how the place actually MADE our stay for us: on how comforting it was to return to and how it made the stay extra special because of its unique nature. The room is very clean, warm and beautiful. Jean-Marc is a very talented carpenter! Maggie and Jean-Marc are also very nice hosts: friendly, helpful, and hospitable. It was also nice to wake up to tea and coffee! I would stay again and recommend it to anyone!"
762029,3143426,2012-12-23,4437395,Marla,The gypsy wagon was a really neat and unique place to stay! Jean-marc and his wife were wonderful hosts! Also the cookies in the morning were delicious :) 
762029,3160735,2012-12-26,131478,Farizan,Jean Marc & Maggie were very nice hosts and welcomed us with open arms when we got there! Cadance was a little cutie too!! we loved the gypsy home as it was unlike any place we've stayed in before! even my frinds who have seen our pictures have commented how cool it is! It was a bit tiny for the 5 of us but the atmosphere of the cabin overruled that. The home is also very near to the bus stops and Whole Foods!! Love it! Thanks guys!!
762029,3280409,2013-01-05,3225224,Jolianne,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in the Gypsy Wagon, witch is very comfortable. Jean-Marc is probably the coolest host we meet during our 5 weeks holiday."
762029,3305810,2013-01-07,1837575,Anit,Jean-Marc and his wife were wonderful hosts.  We didn't get to see them very much as we came in late and spent most of the day away.  They were able to accommodate our schedule extremely well and were very helpful and extremely quick with replying to our inquiries.  We we're so delighted to come and go as we pleased.  We always felt welcome.  It was our pleasure staying in the Gypsy cabin.  The feel was very warm and cozy.  I wish we could have stayed longer!
762029,3323725,2013-01-10,3112242,Valia,"This is a one of a kind experience. The gypsy wagon is very unique and well crafted and cozy. Jean-Marc and Maggie are super nice, and the place is 20 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle. Their house is always open for whatever you might need and they always greeted me with a smile. I would definitely stay there again."
762029,3332946,2013-01-12,1511539,George,"Add a little spice to you life !  Great sleeping Wagon and very cozy. Close to town and Whole Foods :)
Our hosts could not have any more accomodating and their daughter was adorable. There is some road noise, so a fan for some white noise would be beneficial, but other than that ...you will have a very pleasant experience.
Michael and Josh Wade"
762029,3346301,2013-01-14,2984036,Danielle,It was easy to get to from Downtown using transit. Cute little place with very comfy beds and pillows.....friendly hosts. Would definitely stay there again!
762029,3444133,2013-01-30,4739046,Florent,"Nous avons √©t√© tr√®s bien accueilli par nos h√¥tes ! Seattle se situe √† seulement 10 minutes en bus et l'arr√™t de bus est vraiment devant la maison. Tout √©tait propre et calme. Les lits √©taient confortable. Id√©al pour passer 3 jours a Seattle. Le gypsy wagon est petit mais suffisant pour 2 personnes et pour un petit s√©jour.
Merci beaucoup √† nos h√¥tes qui nous ont bien accueilli ! Nous reviendrons si nous sommes de passage √† Seattle !"
762029,3481732,2013-02-05,4630412,Christian,"I had a great stay in the Gypsy Wagon...super comfortable, incredible location for my stay and the Queen Anne area is very nice.  Jean-Marc and family were incredibly accommodating.  Their homestead is idyllic.  I would recommend this place for sure.  Thanks y'all!"
762029,3526250,2013-02-12,793558,Christopher,JM and Maggie were great hosts! They gave us tips and the gypsy wagon was everything we hoped for and more!
762029,3642447,2013-02-26,3758887,Timothy,"Great place, thought it would be cold, but it was perfect!
Thanks for letting us stay at your very unique place."
762029,3806936,2013-03-17,593027,Ethan,"This was a really nice place to stay in Seattle. Very comfortable... super nice hosts, and a good deal. The wagon was very clean, as was the bathroom. There are grocery stores and restaurants in walking distance, but it was nice to have my bike because the Elliot Bay trail was very close, with easy access to downtown."
762029,3909049,2013-03-26,5273031,Brian,Had a great time in the gypsy wagon. Jean-marc and his family were awesome. Great location with easy access to public trans. Cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend checking it or there other space out for sure. Thanks for everything. Would stay there again.
762029,3941148,2013-03-29,5422595,Quentin,Great time there ! Such a perfect way to stay and visit Seattle ! I really enjoyed that wagon and thanks Jean-Marc and Maggie for your hospitality ! 
762029,4099975,2013-04-09,5580190,Joshua,"The gypsy wagon is incredibly cute. Jean-marc is a fantastic host; I stayed with him twice and I was incredibly happy both times.

I liked the Tiny Garden cabin a bit better; it's a little further from the street and so it's a bit quieter. But after a full day of exploring, I hardly noticed; it's an incredible town and I couldn't ask for a better host."
762029,4207205,2013-04-18,5741818,Tamar,"My partner and I had a really great time visiting the  gypsy wagon and showing it off to our friends. We both felt very comfortable in the space. We loved the ambience - very charming. It was clean and warm (we're from the south). Our hosts were really wonderful and accommodating!! WE had an overall really good experience, and I would recommend it to others. 

I would also add that we used public transit exclusively, and the bus stop is pretty much directly across from the location. There is also a Whole Foods a couple of blocks up the street if you're into that sort of thing. "
762029,4269623,2013-04-23,4068826,Crystal,"Jean-marc and Maggie were wonderful hosts! The gypsy wagon was as charming and cozy as the pictures suggest. The location was conveniently located within half a block of the D-line Rapid Bus (20min to downtown with free wifi onboard!). If you're lucky, Jean-marc and Maggie will introduce you to their chickens and rabbit in addition to their friendly dogs. Staying here was the highlight of me and my boyfriend's trip. We'd love to go back if we ever need a place to stay in Seattle. "
762029,4292361,2013-04-25,5526887,Jenny,"This was my first AirBnB experience. I wanted to extend a visit to Seattle after a business trip but wanted something more eclectic.
I find nothing worse than frigid, soulless, corporate environments.

My experience was the opposite of that and incredibly amazing! Jean-Marc have put so much heart and soul to their space. The two rentals, their little dog house, and many other things are all hand crafted! Don't let the word dogs scare you; they have two sweet gorgeous puggles! Aside from that they have a chicken coupe and a really cool garden too! All of these elements plus their hospitality, made it feel as if I was staying with distant relatives! 

The bus stop is literally Infront and you can get anywhere In Seattle from there. I literally just hopped on buses and went everywhere from Lake Washington to downtown! The Whole foods down the way is packed with local items so you can grab the famous MightyO donuts or some fresh oysters. 

No one was checking in that evening so they allowed me to leave my luggage until my early evening flight! Great central location, no weird charges or fees; just a great cozy experience over all!

Ps. They provide you, coffee, towels, heater, comfy pillows, hair dryer and even a little getting around manual! Try it out! :)"
762029,4396142,2013-05-02,1427322,Daniel James T.,Very comfy and totally what I was looking for. Just a simple place to crash after being out all day for several days. Hosts were very nice and accommodating and laid back. 
762029,4506043,2013-05-09,4610897,Mesha,Lovely people.  Super accommodating.  The wagon wheel was perfect for our stay and very close to everywhere you want to be in Seattle.   Highly recommend.  
762029,4551003,2013-05-12,3099886,Isabelle,"Jean Marc was super nice, the wagon too , the only downfall is you can ear a bit of the traffic, bring ear plugs. But great location, good coffee and small fridge that was very convenient !:)"
762029,4598079,2013-05-14,3120312,Alison,"We had a great stay at the wagon! It was very cozy and unique-great if you will be out and about most of the day, very comfortable for sleeping but not much room to move around. Very convenient to the D express bus to downtown. Jean-Marc and Maggie were friendly and accommodating."
762029,4678513,2013-05-20,5666722,Rachael,"Greetings airbnb community,
If you're looking for simplicity, affordability, comfort, & a laid back atmosphere, I would highly recommend both rentals offered by Jean-marc and his sweet wife, Maggie! I rented both garden cabin & gypsy wagon! I was able to arrive 2 days before the rest of my family, and was immediately charmed by my upper bunk in the gypsy wagon :)   I had a blast The Triple Door's show: ""Through the Looking Glass: The Burlesque Alice In Wonderland"", and stumbled upon the huge Norwegian constitutional parade in ballard. Had a delicious afghan meal with my family, with complimentary fernee that melted in your mouth! Our hosts were very warm and welcoming, located close to metro stop, close to whole foods, loved their two pug dogs, chickens, and muppet-like angora rabbit!! Unfortunately, we all left in the morning for some last minute sightseeing before our cruise to alaska, and did not want to wake our hosts, so did not get to say a proper good bye! and Thank You!!"
762029,4743046,2013-05-23,4352486,Rosie,"J has a great Gypsy Wagon.  Excellent craftsmanship, very unique. We enjoyed seeing his garden, chickens and angora rabbit.  Great host & hostess.  Very close to the city bus stop and only a few minutes to downtown Seattle.  "
762029,4829976,2013-05-28,5409887,Elizabeth,"We enjoyed our stay at J and Maggie's Gypsy Wagon. What a unique and cozy experience. J and Maggie were delightfully relaxed and welcoming. Their yard was beautiful! 

thanks again for this fun adventure!"
762029,5188135,2013-06-17,4909953,Harry,"This Gypsy wagon is literally the coolest place we have ever stayed! It's exactly what it looks like, cute and quirky. There were heaters, not that we needed them, and a bathroom located inside the house with fresh towels which was great. Jean-marc and his wife were extremely welcoming and easy to get along with. The bus stop to the city is located 50 meters away and the buses come every fifteen minutes, really convenient. Would definitely stay here again"
762029,5238287,2013-06-19,4086563,Nathalie,"Amazing location & super nice hosts!
Jean-Marc and his wife really made us feel like in a little paradise.
Not only because the garden with the comfortable and cosy gypsy wagon is a little suburbian paradise - yet still close enough to the city. But because they where absolutely easygoing and open minded nice people. We highly recomand staying with them!
"
762029,5318141,2013-06-24,6491631,Dienke,"We had an incredibly relaxed stay in this supercozy gypsy wagon, together with the great hospitality of Jean-Marc and his family. The bus to downtown seattle leaves right across the street, so location/accomodation wise, we absolutely recommend it! "
762029,5372032,2013-06-26,858695,Luke,Responsive communication. Well run and personable. The rooms make for a very unique experience. Recommended hosts!
762029,5417199,2013-06-29,6546727,Lily,"A great experience! The beds are supra comfy, and the bus stop is right around the corner."
762029,5461688,2013-07-01,3403327,Margy,"My boyfriend and I loved staying in the gypsy wagon. We were there for two nights, arriving fairly late the first and we left early the last morning so unfortunately didn't get to talk with JM and Maggie much. Their garden is beautiful, the wagon was clean and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was nice with fresh fluffy towels and great coffee options in the morning. Thank you!"
762029,5555058,2013-07-06,3147245,Chris & Rayna,"The wagon is terrific! The craftsmanship is top notch and the whole thing is very warm and friendly. Plus, we got some great sleep on the comfortable bedding. The back yard garden that it sits in was beautiful. The chickens and hilariously fluffy rabbit are so cute. There's a bus stop maybe 100 yards away from the wagon itself. Very convenient. The bathroom is inside the main house but it's not used by the host family, so it's always available and private. I couldn't have asked for a better BnB experience and I'd recommend this place to anyone."
762029,5625625,2013-07-08,7076478,Kelly,My in-laws stayed here while visiting Seattle and had a delightful time. Jean-mac made them feel completely welcome. They were very comfortable too in the wagon. Would book this again.
762029,5699745,2013-07-12,1587275,Charlotte,"I absolutely loved the gypsy wagon. It was so beautiful and very cozy. I was at the end of a long trip and very tired so I really enjoyed hanging out in the back yard with the chickens and the adorable dogs and watching the sunset.  The house and bathroom were very clean and the coffee and fridge were very helpful. 
The wagon is also in a great location- I was able to bike to downtown, Fremont, capitol hill and more very easily. 
I didn't meet Jean-Marc but his wife Maggie was very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend this unique spot!"
762029,5911820,2013-07-22,3293324,Shayna,"I had an excellent time on my travels thanks to this adorable little wagon room. Jean-Marc and his lovely family were very welcoming and warm. I loved their gardens and animals. While the space doesnt have a bathroom and shower attached, they have made it super easy to use the inside facilities without bothering the rest of the house. I particularly liked the fact that I didnt have to bother anyone when coming and going. I look forward to returning to the area and staying here again!

For those getting around the city without a car, there is a major bus line right out front that will get you around. There is a gorgeous bike/walking path near by as well. If just walking around, downtown, capitol hill, and the freemont area are all within about a 45 minute walk if you dont mind the hills. Stop and pick the blackberries, theyre everywhere!"
762029,6009107,2013-07-26,7254349,Jennifer,"Another wonderful stay with Jean-Marc and Maggie, in the beautifully crafted Gypsy Wagon this time.  The workmanship on the wagon is absolutely amazing, just gorgeous in every detail.  

In addition, the location is perfect - I walked in to town a few times, although there is also a direct bus just across the street, which gets you quickly to the main part of downtown.  Most times I came back, the sweet dogs were there to make sure I felt welcome, and the bunny usually popped out as well to say hi.  There is quite simply no better place to stay in Seattle, especially if you are flying in or out and renting a car as you can take 99 rather than I-5 and avoid a ton of traffic that way.  

Wonderful hosts, adorable critters, fabulous location, free wifi and parking, what more do you need?  Stay here!"
762029,6053508,2013-07-28,7252133,Anna,"We had a great time at the Gypsy Wagon! 
Jay is a great host. The common space was great to have! The yard is pretty, well kept, and has chickens!!! So neat. The gypsy wagon is comfortable and is a great small space! 
If I'm ever back in Seattle I will try to stay here again. "
762029,6150546,2013-08-01,951794,Abe,"The wagon is awesome as were Jean-Marc and his family. And the cute dogs and chickens and rabbit. It was a blast! They are really warm and welcoming people. I felt like I was at a cozy little inn. And if you are using public transportation as we did for the whole stay, it is super easy as there is a bus stop right in front of their house. TEN stars for Jean-Marc!  "
762029,6348288,2013-08-09,1361981,Joel,"This turned out to be a pretty fun place for us to stay in Seattle and very conveniently located. We had a car, but you could easily hop on the bus just across the street and get anywhere you could want in Seattle relatively quickly. We ended up all over town but never felt like it took long to get back in the evening.

The gypsy wagon was a bit small, but since we were able to keep our luggage inside the house there was still plenty of room for two adults and two small children. (Note though that the lower bunks are a bit short for anyone over about six feet). Our kids enjoyed having the yard to run around in in the mornings, and it was nice to have a bit of outdoor space as well as room indoors in the house for showering and breakfast. Overall a fun and pleasant place to stay."
762029,6386565,2013-08-11,4807650,Antonia + Mike,"Jean-Marcs Gypsy Wagon hat allen, besonders den Kindern, viel Spass gemacht. Obwohl der Wagen sehr klein ist, macht Jean-Marc alles, um es angenehm zu gestalten. Man teilt sich ein Badezimmer mit den Mietern einer kleinen H√ºtte, die er auch selber gemacht hat. Jean-Marc ist sehr gastfreundlich. Ein origineller Fund."
762029,6465902,2013-08-13,7407216,Olivia,"We had an awesome stay in the gypsy wagon. We were in town for a wedding and were out exploring the rest of the time so we weren't there too much. However, the bed was super comfy and Jean-Marc allows access to their separate bathroom/shower, kitchenette and living room. Everything was clean and tidy. The D line bus runs right outside his place which was really convenient for us!

For the little bit we talked to Jean-Marc I could tell he's a great guy and excellent host. Next time we hear of friends visiting Seattle we will be sure to mention the GW as an option!"
762029,6565535,2013-08-17,5628387,Chad,"Jean-Marc and his wife are great.  The gypsy wagon was just as advertised.  We are tempted to ask them to build one for us so that we can tow it around the country and have the same experience every night.  Their house is very convenient on the D bus line to most places of interest to visitors, and it's tough to beat waking up to chickens and a rabbit and two dogs and a vegetable garden in the morning.  It kind of feels like you're on a farm in the middle of the city.  Good stuff.  Nice people. Lots of fun. Highly recommended."
762029,6689291,2013-08-21,7509672,Deborah,"This was our first trip to the Great NorthWest, and our stay in the Gypsy Wagon far exceeded our expectations. Our host, Jean-Marc, is a warm, affable fellow and a wealth of information. I felt like I was chatting with an old friend. The Wagon was comfortable with sufficient outlets to accommodate the electronic lifestyle, and the common areas are clean and have all the amenities of home. There is off-street parking, and since parking is a premium in Seattle, access to the bus stop across the street is a big plus. There you can grab the D-Line which takes you to the heart of Seattle's downtown district. The neighborhood is quiet and the chickens, small animals, and garden give you a homestead flavor you won't get anywhere else. I'd not only recommend it, I'm looking forward to a repeat visit."
762029,6784251,2013-08-25,7368992,Mark,Our stay in the gypsy wagon was very comforting and fun. It was noticeable that Jean-Marc is an experienced 'airbnb-er'. All was well organized and we are really gratefull that we not only could drop off our luggage earlier than check in time but also be able to hang out in the living room for a while after check out time. We hope that the gypsy wagon will stay for a long time on airbnb as it is in our opinion a great addition to airbnb and a unique place to sleep. Great job Jean-Marc!
762029,6937897,2013-08-31,6861984,Simone,"Seattle was our last city before returning home after a 2 weeks road trip.  Jean-Marc was a kind, relaxed host.  He offers a separate communal space for his guests and a quaint back yard.  He gave us all the tools we needed to discover and explore Seattle.  The rooms are also quite close to the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods, a treat of Seattle. AND he has the CUteST pet BUNNY!"
762029,7007895,2013-09-03,4185737,Jamie,"I spent one night in the wagon with friends, then moved to the cabin. The wood smell in the wagon made it feel more like camping, which was nice. Everything about it was pretty perfect. There's a whole foods a couple of blocks away, and the bus downtown was convenient. 
I think the night in the wagon was the best night's sleep during a two week vacation. "
762029,7077235,2013-09-05,8281747,Annie,"The wagon is superb! Tiny but very comfortable, and it makes me feel to be like camping in the wood. Jean-Marc and his family are very friendly!"
762029,7158498,2013-09-09,7256283,Marie,"Hi ! I stayed 3 nights in Jean-Marc gipsy wagon with my sister. It's exactly the same than show in pictures, with two double beds and some place for luggages. We had a bathroom and a living room shared with the tiny cabine, very spacious with a microwave and a fridge. Jean-Marc and his wife Maggie were very nice and available. The place is aroud 20 minutes to downtown, there is two buses just nearby. I recommended this place !"
762029,7254711,2013-09-13,4776594,Kim,"We loved staying in the Gypsy Wagon! It was comfortable ""camping"" in the cutest garden oasis in Seattle. Jean-Marc and Maggie are helpful without being overbearing. Their animals are so cute and well-behaved that it was a joy to be around them. The place was really clean, too. Complimentary coffee in the morning was so appreciated! I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a comfortable bed in a great space. It's nice to see people living their dream! I will dream about coming back to this awesome spot. Thanks Jean-Marc and Maggie for helping to make our stay in Seattle easy and unique!"
762029,7515781,2013-09-23,4510091,Diane,"This airbnb stands out as a unique heartful experience in a most loved space, both the cabin and the yard and space. What then really topped it off was how well organized it was set up. From the labeled shelf in linen closet for toiletries to healthy clean water dispenser to fridge to coffee maker. Everything is mindfully and beautifully set up for everyone's comfort and convenience. We will definitely be back. Thank you Maggie and Jean-Marc

762029,7634747,2013-09-27,6199756,Jasmin,"I absolutely loved staying in the gypsy-wagon! A lovely family - generous hosts. I was late for my bus and short $1.25 bus money - they lent me the cash and I paid them back later! Clean and comfortable space inside the wagon as well as in the house, fresh towels every day. My stay here was top-notch. I would stay here over and over again!"

762029,7875302,2013-10-07,8196009,Stephen,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was awesome!   I love staying at unique places and supporting local entrepreneurs . . . and Jean-Marc's gypsy wagon gave me that opportunity.   It was very clean and cozy.    By the way, this guy built this gypsy wagon himself . . the craftsmanship is beautiful!   There is another small cabin in the back as an alternate option.   I love walking and it was about a 20 to 30 minute walk to downtown Seattle.  If you are looking for a unique and affordable stay in Settle . . . definitely stay here!"
762029,7964770,2013-10-10,725443,Geneva,"This is a great location with easy access to city transit- we hopped all over the city from here.  Also groceries, coffee and even a gym fairly nearby.  The lodging is comfortable, simple, quirky and perfect.  What a skilled craftsman this man is!"
762029,8091783,2013-10-15,1152936,Mike,"We had a lovely stay in the gypsy wagon. We were in town visiting family and just needed a cozy play to stay with our six year old daughter.   The gypsy wagon was great and very comfortable. I was worried it would be cold and we actually had to turn the heat off each night.  The chickens did wake us up two of the mornings but not at an ungodly hour and we found it amusing. The last morning we were there the chickens were silent which worried us. Turns out they had been let out of their coop and were co-chillin and enjoying breakfast on the other side of the house.  The host also has two adorable dogs that we only met once briefly. The rest of our stay we never even knew they were there.  

The beds were comfy and we slept well.  We plan on staying here again.   Also! Props for tasty hot cocoa. Yum!   Really great communication with the host and a great place to stay. "
762029,8132190,2013-10-17,8122449,Shannon,Spending two nights in the Gypsy Wagon was our first AirBnB experience and we couldn't have asked for anything better.  Thank you so much!
762029,8186921,2013-10-20,5924318,John,I enjoyed one night in the gypsy caravan.  Very cozy. The other amenities in the house for guests were very clean and well organized. Very fast response to emails by Jean-Marc.  Enjoyed sharing the yard with the chickens. 
762029,8301191,2013-10-24,9043086,Anne,"We had a great stay at the Gypsy Wagon; a real adventure for my kids. They loved it!
 It was cozy, very clean and the owners so friendly and helpful. 
The location was good; we used the public transportation and were able to get around/make connections easily.
I can highly recommend this to those looking for unique accommodations that are a good fit with the feel of the city.

762029,8370069,2013-10-28,5517658,Fabio,Fantastic place and excellent host. 
762029,8499145,2013-11-03,8660906,Michael,This was our first experience using Airbnb and I can honestly say that we are glad that we did! The hosts were wonderful and the accommodations were fantastic! The custom built gypsy caravan is truly a work of art and was second to none. We thoroughly enjoyed waking up in the city to see chickens and a bunny rabbit right outside our door. Our five year old wants us to move into the caravan and I can see why. We are so thankful to have been able to stay in the gypsy caravan instead of some stuffy hotel. We will certainly be back as well and will gladly recommend these accommodations to others.
762029,8587122,2013-11-06,9295386,Ed,The gypsy wagon worked out perfectly for us!  Jean-Marc was a great host and was quick to respond to my texts/calls once we arrived in Seattle. We stayed there in November and we were impressed with how comfortable the gypsy wagon was. The wagon and the common areas were all very clean. I would love to stay there again next time I'm in town!
762029,8836782,2013-11-20,8557797,Jason,"You'd be nuts not to stay in this magical handcrafted gypsy wagon. It's one of a kind experience. And you get to tell everyone you meet, ""yeah, I'm staying in a gypsy wagon in Seattle."" Then just sit back and let the conversation fly."
762029,9159757,2013-12-10,9031297,Ayumi,"As soon as we walked in the wagon, we felt how special it was! It  is built so beautufully. The owner J and his family were very friendly and shared the story of how he built the wagon. The common area and the wagon were very clean and everything worked perfectly. The wagon had a nice heater to have kept us very warm during the freezing nights and days of our stay. We loved friendly chickens and the rabbit in the yard. This place is magical and we would love to come back again!"
762029,9266864,2013-12-17,1385726,Apa,"Jean Marc is a very responsible, friendly and thoughtful host. The  Gypsy Wagon is a lovely tiny living space with stained glass windows, Wifi, electricity, and two very comfortable beds. It is situated in an ideal location with easy on street parking. There is a Rapid Ride bus which will take you downtown in just a few short minutes within an easy walk. There is a Whole Foods store on the busy street nearby with great organic wholesome food.  This is a wonderful, memorable place to stay if you plan to spend your time out exploring the area while in Seattle. Jean Marc is a talented crafts person with  great communication skills. He is helpful and always available to help."
762029,9764619,2014-01-08,2873366,Dan,The Gypsy Wagon was a great accomodation for the few days that I was in Seattle. It is a quaint little structure that was very comfortable and inviting. I appreciated the fact that the common room and bathroom had a separate entrance so that I wasn't always bothering J and his wife. It was very close to a bus stop which took me downtown. Everything about the place was great and I would gladly stay here again next time I am in Seattle.
762029,9839024,2014-01-13,9899195,Tommy,"Had a great stay in the cozy wagon, would certainly repeat again as it was convenient to reach all the different parts of seattle."
762029,9932330,2014-01-20,6433651,Cecilia,"Cozy, warm gypsy wagon had everything we were looking for! It was so comfortable, we didn't want to get out of bed. Added bonus - petting the neighboring Angora rabbit."
762029,10026735,2014-01-26,5633602,Dan,"Do yourself a favor and stay here.  Great location, fun wagon, and functional common space.  Thumbs up!"
762029,10069649,2014-01-28,1300195,Miles,"Super cozy, fun spot. Marc was very accommodating and all around a great guy. Loved all of the animals around, too! Will definitely stay here again!"
762029,10179147,2014-02-04,11105468,Amber,"I had a friend visiting from the Netherlands, and this was his first time in Seattle. I am so happy I found this place for us to stay. It was whimsical and cozy, and Jean-Marc was a very hospitable host. He was flexible and very helpful when we were looking for good places to eat and hang out. And the bunny Tribble and the chickens were also very nice company. Also, the location was perfect-- walking distance from grocery stores and coffee shops and just across the street from a major bus line. Thanks to this place, my friend had a great first experience in Seattle, and I can't wait to come back here again."
762029,10315453,2014-02-12,2105137,Nikki,"Very hospitable host and a cosy, warm wagon in the garden with chickens and a beautiful rabbit for company. We had a lovely stay and would definitely come back if in Seattle again."
762029,10497777,2014-02-22,11372429,Sarah,"My partner and I had an awesome stay in the heated gypsy wagon. Jean-Marc was more than willing to help us out and was excellent with communication even though we arrived at 1:00am on a Monday morning. He was nice enough to turn the light and the heat on for us for when we arrived. His description of the private wagon is accurate. His wagon is comfortable, unique, and beautifully crafted (and warm too). Also, his place is literally across the street from a bus that will take you downtown in ten minutes or north toward Ballard if you choose. We would definitely stay again, as my next Airbnb experience will be difficult to beat after staying here. Thanks, Jean-Marc.  "
762029,10611190,2014-02-27,5553023,Tyler,"Beautiful wagon, and beautiful area. Host was very accommodating!"
762029,10662012,2014-03-02,5953772,Burl,Another great experience.
762029,10964425,2014-03-15,11996443,Cathy,"We loved the little wagon, the chickens, the rabbit and the dogs! You can walk up about 6 flights of stairs (from street to street) to get to the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle and take a bus to downtown. This is quite a pretty walk through a nice Seattle neighborhood. We only saw the hosts once, but are familiar with Seattle, so we didn't need any tips. The bathroom and dining room are in the house, which is separate from where the hosts live. Wagon is adorable with reading lights, wifi connection and a little heater, which we only turned on once. It was very easy to find from the closest bus stop, just a three minute walk away. "
762029,11133343,2014-03-22,10879501,Markus,"Jean-Marc was a really nice host and his gypsy wagon is a wonderfully crafted piece of art. It was great to be so close to the city and still have a little place just for ourselves after a busy day.  :)

762029,11296782,2014-03-29,11213258,David,"This past week our daughter and son-n-law booked the cutest bed and and breakfast we have ever had the opportunity to stay in! It was in a beautifully handmade made Gypsy Wagon! It resides in our wonderful hosts, Jay and Maggie's back yard, just slightly north of downtown Seattle. We shared the backyard with some cute chickens in a hen house and the most adorable angora rabbit. Just inside the back door is a common area with table and chairs, a refrigerator, microwave, and an individual serve coffee maker. Close by, in walking distance, is a Whole Food Store and we were just a half block from a major bus line which if you take it you are in downtown Seattle in less than 10 minutes. Jay and Maggie are great, around if you need them but completely unobtrusive.They have a sweet 3 year daughter and two wonderful little dogs. I can honestly say that if you want a great value and a convenient, comfortable stay, book the Gypsy wagon soon because when this gets out it will be hard to get into this great place!"
762029,11380484,2014-03-31,5378920,Pritisha,"Jean-Marc was great and the listing was as we expected. It was quite a novelty experience and close to town. The neighbourhood was also safe. In the house we also had access to a fridge, microwave, utensils and a coffee machine.
We will definitely be staying here next time we are in town.
Thanks for the experience! :D"
762029,11502256,2014-04-05,13743064,David,"This was an awesome experience. Kind of like camping in the city, in a 5 star hut. Jean-Marc is a master craftsman who builds tiny homes and shares graciously with others. Highly recommend this stay."
762029,11571473,2014-04-07,3560370,Laura,"Jean was a great host. He respond to all my questions immediately, and he was always available.He made us feel very comfortable, everything was very clean and the location is pretty close to downtown, you have everything what you need around that area. It was a great experience !"
762029,11753956,2014-04-14,13104605,Thomas,"Jean-Marc and Maggie were incredible hosts. The gypsy wagon, and the rest of the property including the chickens, pugs, angora rabbit, tricycle, is an awesome experience."
762029,12030741,2014-04-21,14021986,Samantha,Jean was a great host. He patiently explained everything for us and left us with a lot of private room. It was a pleasant stay. It was especially cool to live in a gypsy wagon!!
762029,12165300,2014-04-24,14207360,Esteban,"Staying in the Gypsy Wagon is a truly one of a kind experience; one I will never forget and hopefully re-visit in the future. Jean-Marc and his family could not be more welcoming and the surrounding flora and fauna - including his own couple puggles, chickens, and a bunny (not to mention the awesome hammock and swing) - make this a sort of paradise. Take this escape in the Evergreen State. You will not regret it!"
762029,12609798,2014-05-06,12084843,Molly,"I really enjoyed my time at the gypsy wagon and will definitely stay here again if I get the opportunity.

762029,13014100,2014-05-17,5068577,Brad,Jean-Marc was a great host. We arrived a couple hours before our scheduled check in time and he was very accommodating and let us check in right away. The place was very nice and clean and is in a great location. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
762029,13152563,2014-05-20,14758782,Vanessa,"Jay & Maggie were great hosts, though we barely saw them. Everything was clean, the back yard and wagon are a tiny piece of paradise! I definitely got backyard camping nostalgia, and we both found our stay very relaxing. The gyspy wagon is beautiful, both inside and out, and we found the beds very comfortable. Andrew says he wants his own tiny house now!"
762029,13257324,2014-05-23,4244676,Ellen,"Very quaint little place. Just as cute as the pictures. Access to the common area was really nice. Keurig coffee in the morning! Very close to the rapid ride so it was easy to get everywhere. Also, you have got to hang with Tribble, their angora rabbit. Great stay overall!"
762029,13358864,2014-05-26,6472926,Mackenzie,"Where do I begin with this gypsy wagon!!?? We felt like we stayed in a fairy-tale....such a perfect location. Gorgeous wood work, gorgeous place. Super accommodating. I highly recommend you stay here if you visit Seattle! J and Maggie are the best, sweetest hosts and make you feel right at home. Thanks for everything, guys!!! :-) "
762029,13477850,2014-05-28,3710173,Deborah,"This place is charming!! Jean-Marc was friendly and helpful, though we saw him very little. The yard, garden, chickens and bunny add to the charm.   The bed was very comfortable, though it is a very small space.  It worked well for us as we came in late and left early to spend time at FolkLife each day. 

Coffee and tea in common room appreciated.
Easy access to downtown Seattle.  Thank you! "
762029,13587610,2014-05-31,6542146,Bridget,We loved our stay in the gypsy wagon! Jean-Marc and Maggie were both incredibly friendly and the location was a short distance from almost everything in Seattle. The adorable bunny and chickens also added to the experience! 
762029,13847175,2014-06-06,165610,Karelia,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the gypsy wagon. It was so quaint and cosy.
It was very handy for the D line bus from downtown (15 mins ).
The only downside was the road noise but didn't spoil my 2 night stay.
Thanks Jay and Maggie"
762029,13963255,2014-06-09,14851537,Cassie,"Hospitality was on point, very gracious and laid back. This is the perfect location in the city to stay, walking distance to the D-Line and a very appealing scenic walk to Fremont.

Also, the Gypsy Wagon was the perfect amount of kitsch--I miss it already. I will absolutely be back to Seattle and I hope it won't be booked when I return. "
762029,14100056,2014-06-11,16174999,Grace,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a great one! My husband and I really enjoyed the beautiful caravan and found it to be extremely cozy, clean, and comfortable. The beds are very pleasant and its a wonderful place to spend time. The backyard is a little bit of rural paradise in the middle of the city. Love the chickens and especially Tribble, the cutest bunny in the world. 

The way the hosts have their space set up is great as the guests have access to a door in front and through to the back yard without bothering the hosts at all. The inside portion has water, coffee, fridge, and a very clean bathroom with nice fluffy towels. Its great to be able to have a shower whenever without bothering anyone. The hosts and their friendly dogs are warm and welcoming and still give guests ample privacy and space. 

The location also is great, close to downtown without having to do anything scary like drive on the viaduct, and less than 5 mins to Ballard. 

Basically we loved it, we'll be back, and this was the perfect introduction to airbnb. "
762029,14281519,2014-06-16,2801480,Jon Cory And Stephanie,"I am a big fan of ""roughing it"" when I travel. But this was better then I expected. Yes the trailer is small. Only enough room to sleep really but if needed you can store your luggage inside the part of the house that is separated for guest use.  The trailer was incredible!  It was made by hand!  Very authentic and vintage style. I would love one for my own car and travels.  But beds are super comfortable and the heater was more then sufficient for some chilly and rainy nights. The guest half of the house has a very comfortable living and dinning room area, complete with morning coffee and wifi so I could relax and do some research. And a small refrigerator that I could store my personal food stash in. Hot bathtub very relaxing!  
I brought my toddler who absolutely loved it!!!  The backyard made a wonderful ""playground"" for her, free to roam without worries. An awesome slide, the cutest bunny I've ever seen, fabulous chicken coop, organic garden, and more!  Despite the animals and rain, there was no smell and no mess. Kept extremely clean and tidy. 
The owner was there in a flash when I needed some assistance.  But otherwise we had total privacy. Thank you so much for a lovely stay and for your incredible creativity that you have so kindly shared with the public!  
(If you need the Ritz Carlton or Hilton then move on). But if you are into authentic an genuine cabin style affordable stays with legit and welcoming service.... I'm sure you'll love it!  As I did "
762029,14677216,2014-06-24,1649631,Janie,"Our stay at the gypsy wagon was absolutely fantastic. Jay and Maggie were super kind, friendly and accommodating.

Jean-Marc greeted me instantly and we chatted for a few minutes which made me feel very comfortable. He was very thorough with explaining the guest area and history of the wagon etc. The charm of staying in the wagon is like nothing else I have experienced. Everything is very clean and the bed is super comfortable. Plenty of room to sleep two if necessary (bunkbeds). The common area is very nice and everything is super accessible. A bus to the downtown is a minute walk down the hill. I loved staying here. Thank you so much! Highly recommended!

It's small but GREAT and you definitely see all the work and love the hosts have put into it. Beds are super comfy, aircon and heater are provided. The bathroom and the common area are super clean, we were provided fresh towels, coffee and tea, dvds and more! Jean-Marc, the host, was lovely and very helpful! We absolutely loved staying here and would highly recommend it to everyone!"

They kept everything very tidy and clean.  Great location within 10 min bus from Ballard, Fremont, downtown and Capitol Hill.  Would definitely stay there again!"

The Gypsy wagon and the other accommodations on the lot are super unique and cute, unlike any other place I've stayed. The wagon was a little cramped with my husband and 20 month old and me, but we really only slept in it anyway, and having the common space and the awesome yard/lounging spaces made it work just fine. 

Jean-Marc was available and helpful when we needed him and we really enjoyed the feel of being away from the city when in actuality downtown was just a quick and easy bus ride away.  

I would stay there again, and maybe check out another of the accommodations!

"
762029,17843539,2014-08-18,17642037,Shannon,This was a great place to stay! Jean-Marc was a great host. We felt very comfortable and at home while we were there. It was also very convienant that we were so close to the bus stop. Location was great! 
762029,18118654,2014-08-22,17556713,Emily,"Staying in the gypsy wagon was a great time. You are provided with a common room that is shared with the guests staying in the other 2 cabins in the backyard.  Jean-Marc was very friendly and accommodating. The towels and washcloths were washed every day also which was nice.  The only catch is there is only one shared bathroom, but it is easily worked out as guests are asked to take that into consideration.  Overall, a good stay and would stay again (also Tribble the rabbit lives outside and is lovely)."
762029,18240922,2014-08-24,12166588,Trudy,"Jean-Marc was waiting for us - my 14-year-old granddaughter and me -  when we arrived and made us feel very welcome.  There were no problems whatsoever, and we had everything we needed or wanted.  The common area was very comfortable and inviting.  The beds were comfortable and the gypsy wagon itself was very beautiful.  My granddaughter thinks I am a very cool grandma for finding this place!"
762029,18436149,2014-08-26,2267847,Caitlin,I had a fantastic stay in the Gypsy Wagon. Clean and well appointed.  Will surely stay here again on my next trip through Seattle. 
762029,18938814,2014-09-03,16097109,Rafael,I loved staying at the gypsy wagon. It was comfortable and warm and only a 20-min bus trip away from downtown Seattle ( where i needed to be). I was treated well and would definitely go there again.
762029,20101887,2014-09-23,17037256,Misong,"The house was great :) host was really kind, the room was clean, and the location was great too. Gypsy wagon was sooo cute!!! I would love to stay there again if I revisit Seattle."
762029,22050157,2014-10-28,648111,Adrian,"Most outstanding Airbnb ever! Can it get any better than curling up under your warm blanket and listening to Seattle's rain on the roof of your gipsy wagon? A gipsy wagon with heating, power outlets and wifi. A cross the street from express bus to downtown. And across the street from Whole Foods. Jean-Marc has been a super accommodating host. I'd come back anytime."
762029,22335526,2014-11-03,22926071,Paige,"What an easy way to stay in Seattle! The gypsy wagon was affordable, easy and convenient."
762029,22447018,2014-11-06,4232595,Jon,"This was my second time staying in one of Jean-Marc and Maggie's gypsy wagons. For me this is the best place to stay in the whole city. They're heated with strong wifi so the only difference between this room and a hotel is with these guys you step out onto basically a private park complete with a garden, a rabbit and chickens. "
762029,23163328,2014-11-24,3845618,Emma Ailinn,It was great staying in the wagon. A real experience. The neighborhood was a Jody bus ride from everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle and Jean-Marc is a good discreet host. 
762029,23446746,2014-12-01,23042121,Victoria,"I had a great stay! Clean, cozy, and so charming!"
762029,23758157,2014-12-09,16740945,Li,Jean is really an ideal host. The wagon is in the yard and we really enjoy privacy without seeing other guests. The bathroom is shared by guests and it's clean.
762029,24027457,2014-12-17,23534148,Rebeckah,"Jean Marc's Gypsy Wagon was fabulous. It was clean, charming, well-crafted, artful and in a great location for me...walkable to the Whole Foods store, right on a main busline, and right near my mailbox unit.

Jean Marc was friendly, welcoming, responsive and enthusiastic. I really enjoyed the balance of the welcoming vibe and the independence to be able to come and go at leisure.

Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would stay there again."
762029,24326105,2014-12-26,22961889,Fan,"Marc is a really nice guy, the wagon was neat, while the lower level might be a little small for a guy though, but generally it's a nice place to stay. "
762029,24667767,2015-01-01,24551849,James,"Jean-Marc was very welcoming, and even took extra time to show us and some of our family we were visiting in the area features of the stay, and shared some of his own history. Our young grandchildren (who live nearby) were with us when we checked in. Jean-Marc introduced them to his Angora rabbit, the hens (which are very quiet, in case you are wondering), the slide, and swing. Everything was super clean and serviceable. We stayed in the original Gypsy wagon- which was in perfect condition and really a lot of fun. We stayed at the end of December during pretty cold weather for Seattle. The wagon was very warm and comfortable, as were the shower facilities. This is like an oasis in the midst of the city- also close to major bus routes. Highly recommended, especially to add a little adventure to your stay in Seattle!  "
762029,25050709,2015-01-05,563610,Dennis,"My stay in the Gypsy Wagon was amazing! The wagon was nice and cozy, which kept us very warm through the Seattle winter. Jean Marc was a great host who made sure that we were well taken care of while giving us privacy. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a unique place to stay in Seattle!"
762029,25267395,2015-01-11,6074970,Daniel,"J was an amazing host. Met with him the first day and spoke a bit, helped us feel at home. Very friendly but leaves his guests to do their own thing, which was nice. The wagon was beautiful and perfect for us. The location also could not be any better. We didn't have a car but not even a block away is a very busy and useful bus stop. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience!"
762029,25411632,2015-01-15,20856474,Sarrah,"If you are going to Seattle and looking for a nice, clean place to lay your head this is it!  I was visiting Seattle solo for a few days and was looking for an affordable place to stay that was close to a bus line.  The wagon is so cute and cozy and was the perfect place for me.  There are 2 major bus lines that you can catch about 300 ft from J's place.  I didn't spend a ton of time at the wagon, but when I was there it was very quiet and I never had to wait for the bathroom.  In fact other than meeting J on my arrival I never saw anyone else while I was there.  Everything about J's place is wonderful.  From the cabins, to the proximity to the bus line, to the cleanliness of the bathroom facilities, not to mention the chickens and the angora rabbit.  All around a great place to stay.  If you are debating weather or not to stay here: DO IT!  You will not be disappointed."
762029,26143121,2015-02-04,8939139,Leah,Jean-Marc was so welcoming and personable. He made us feel right at home and made sure we were comfortable. The wagon was very funky and cute. It was exactly what we had expected. We had a really lovely stay! Thank you Jean-Marc!
762029,26823949,2015-02-20,23717870,Alaria,"We loved it! Great location, comfortable, and fun! I highly recommend! "
762029,27093338,2015-02-25,16882088,Katie Gray,"This place is perfect. Seriously. Close to everything, charming, comfortable. If you're into rustic minimalism, it's an inspiration. 

"
762029,27393397,2015-03-03,15540088,Celia,"There was nothing less than terrific here.  The neighborhood was comfortable, quiet and just a few steps from the D train which made getting where we needed to go so easy.  The wagon itself was great!  So clean with a really appealing atmosphere and surprisingly comfortable beds!  After some flight cancellations and rearrangements Jean-Marc was so helpful in extending our stay.  Will definitely return to the great view and adorable chickens!  Great way to meet other travelers!"
762029,27504894,2015-03-06,27592929,Daniel,Nice place. Jean-Marc and Maggie are friendly. And I love the animals there!
762029,28021868,2015-03-16,19123740,Lauren,"Staying at the Gypsy Wagon was everything I hoped it would be. Jean-Marc was very sweet and informative upon our arrival, and gave us complete privacy for our stay. My husband is 6""3 and we felt cozy for our whole stay. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to be close to the city, but on a budget. "
762029,28314386,2015-03-22,26823827,Hannah,The Wagon With Heart looked just like the pictures and is beautifully made. Right next to a bus line which makes it easy to get downtown. Overall a wonderful place to stay!
762029,28540980,2015-03-25,315557,Boris,"Very unique space in the city outside of downtown. Kinda like urban camping. The bed is very comfy. Something's to note is there are a lot of city noise from cars and trains, so don't think this is a quite/secluded spot, it's off a big road. "
762029,28783446,2015-03-30,5211350,Betsy,"Great place, great hosts. Thoroughly enjoyed our gypsy digs in Seattle. 
"
762029,29177005,2015-04-05,22545718,Juliet,"This adorable Gypsy Wagon lived up to its rave reviews. It was comfortable and clean, and far more interesting that staying in a motel or hotel. My partner and I traveled from southern Oregon to Seattle to attend a conference. The neighborhood was convenient to downtown yet felt like an oasis, despite the traffic noise.  I enjoyed the little free time I had walking the neighborhood, chatting with Jean-Marc and sunning in the backyard with the chickens. (If you like walking, take the multiple staircases above the house; you'll eventually be rewarded with a great view of the Sound.) The D Line RapidRide is literally a block away and runs every 15 minutes on weekdays, which made for easy commuting to and from the conference. We also made good use of the Whole Foods Market a few blocks away. Although we didn't get to meet Maggie, Jean-Marc was an engaging host who made us feel very welcome. Our ""neighbors"" in the adjacent Gypsy Wagon were pleasant and respectful as well.
We would absolutely stay here again!"
762029,29585948,2015-04-09,12552778,Robert,"Really nice guy, loved staying in the wagon! "
762029,29849488,2015-04-13,2450859,Stephanie,"This place is awesome! Check in and out was super easy. The bus was nearby and incredibly convenient. The wagon was so fun to sleep in and really comfy. Atmosphere was peaceful and quiet, exactly what I was looking for. Oh, there were also really, really adorable fluffy bunnies in the yard! I would definitely stay here again/"
762029,30143411,2015-04-18,29415540,Kent,"The Gypsy Wagon was a wonderful experience.  Very comfortable and inviting.  Jean-Marc is an excellent host and a very talented craftsman.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the stay.
"
762029,30471445,2015-04-22,8408328,Amy,"I was in town for an professional planning conference in downtown Seattle and wanted to find a spot to stay off the beaten track. Boy did I find it! The Gypsy Wagon was the perfect place to come back to and relax after long days of nonstop learning and talking to people. It was easy to get to by bus, but I also took some lovely walks through the Queen Anne neighborhood to and from downtown (about 3 miles away). If you're a runner, there are also some good running spots. I ran to discovery park and back one morning, and it was another really nice way to get to know a new neighborhood. I highly recommend staying with Jean-Marc and his wife (and rabbits and chickens). If you're heading to Seattle, look them up!"
762029,30892783,2015-04-28,6866795,Eduardo,"Do not be fooled by how little this place looks in pictures. If you're by yourself and even with a +1, this needs to be the place you stay at. The location is super convenient and the place is super cool. Would stay again 10/10."
762029,31595197,2015-05-07,31221501,Sarah,"Great, quiet neighborhood and very accessible to public transit. The wagon and yard were both dreamy! We stayed for 5 nights while looking for an apartment and were sad to leave. Would absolutely recommend."
762029,31699027,2015-05-09,26528877,Katie,We had a great time staying in the gypsy wagon! It was very comfortable and Jean-Marc was super friendly. There was even a guide to some great places in Seattle (the Bayside Cafe is awesome).  I would definitely stay here again!
762029,32005042,2015-05-12,32439406,Elena,We loved staying here. A wonderful Gypsy Wagon that was clearly crafted with love. We enjoyed being in such a peaceful environment and hanging out with the chickens! Thank you Jean-Marc!!
762029,32552987,2015-05-19,13669832,Ryan,The Hand crafted Gypsy Wagon exceeded my expectations by far. Jean-Marc was helpful and gave us plenty of privacy. The Queen Anne area is quite close to the city which made sight seeing easier. The wagon was cozy and everything you need is provided for you (we didn't end up using the fan or the heater). Also the views are beautiful and it helps that there's a whole foods across the street. 10/10 would stay there again!
762029,32727493,2015-05-20,10421220,Dave,I did not meet the host. Listing was as advertised. Environment was clean and well kept. Would recommend to others. 
762029,33256847,2015-05-26,30747008,Taylor,Our experience was great. The little cabin was perfect for us for the weekend. It is small and cozy and very comfortable. The animals around the property were a plus too. We plan on staying here again. 
762029,33547436,2015-05-29,21185392,John,Awesome experience! Great location and the gypsy wagon is rad! Jean-Marc is super nice and I'll definitely stay again the next time I come to Seattle!
762029,34468715,2015-06-08,19543430,Kathleen,"This area is perfect! We loved being ten minutes from Pikes Place and then only a couple minutes from the Fremont area and Union Lake. There's so much to do and the wagon itself is adorable, comfortable and has a great view! JM is welcoming and friendly! The bunnies are friendly as well! Overall, wonderful experience!"
762029,34682384,2015-06-10,34692073,Stephanie,"This was my first experience with AirB&B.  It was a great adventure for me. Jean-Marc made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt very safe there.
"
762029,35408340,2015-06-18,31476861,Suzette,"Fabulous stay! Excellent location, kind host - and definitely comfortable, warm, and cozy. I highly recommend the gypsy wagon!"
762029,35661547,2015-06-21,8360410,Elise,"The gypsy wagon was great! Everything was as advertised, clean, comfortable, and adorable. They have a great set-up and a charming place. Highly recommended. "
762029,36019285,2015-06-24,30994138,Jessica,Jean was friendly and courteous! The wagon was so cool and his home is conveniently located. His pets were a plus lol Highly recommended!
762029,36681614,2015-06-30,18762482,Jordan,"This was the perfect place to stay for our weekend getaway to Seattle. We never had the pleasure of meeting the host, but could tell he put a lot of care into not just the gypsy wagon, but also his backyard and entire home. The bed was comfy, the location was very central and we had an overall great time. Would recommend to everyone and will definitely stay here again."
762029,36986198,2015-07-03,13455368,Brandon & Marisa,"This was an absolutely awesome stay. Comfortable beds, SUPER easy access to downtown Seattle. Literally hop on the bus outside of where you're sleeping and you'll be in downtown in about 10 minutes. Also very close to Kerry park which overlooks the entire city. They use this view for all of the postcards so you can rest assured you'll be seeing the best view Seattle has to offer. I can't thank Jean Marc enough for his kind hospitality and welcoming tone. I know one things for sure, when I'm back in Seattle I know EXACTLY where I'll be staying."
762029,37765076,2015-07-10,35209757,Michael,"Adorable micro-home, very clean. Easy access to a major transit line was a huge plus. The whole foods nearby was also very handy for a quick cup of coffee in the morning or a snack for the day out. The wagon even managed to stay cool on the hotter days of our trip."
762029,38132322,2015-07-13,34016106,Urszula,"It was fun to stay with Jean-Marc, we loved his wagon. Be prepared to have some food, there are no shops around, and we had to take bus and go to the city for breakfast. Otherwise it was great! "
762029,38617296,2015-07-17,35336200,Constanza,"Jean Marc es muy amable y el lugar perfecto y c√≥modo. Caminas un poco y tomas el bus para ir a la ciudad, llegas en 10 minutos. Totalmente recomendado."
762029,38860207,2015-07-19,34982826,Diana,"We had a lovely stay at the Gypsy Wagon! It is truly a work of great craftsmanship. Jean-Marc was welcoming and responsive, while allowing us all the privacy and independence we desired. The location is very situated for public transit. We would absolutely spend another weekend in the Gypsy Wagon! "
762029,39757615,2015-07-26,33525301,Joyce,"Everything that we had expected staying at the Gypsy Wagon come true. The place was wonderful and we had complete privacy but if we needed anything Jean-Marc was very responsive. 
Thank you for a wonderful stay, we love the chickens and your bunnies are adorable!!!!! 
The location was perfect and we look forward to coming back again soon.
Thanks again!"
762029,40107231,2015-07-28,35161059,Liz,The Gypsy Wagon was a great experience!! The small cabin feel was cozy and very private. The wagon was very clean and exceeded my expectation. Next time we're in Seattle we'll be staying in the wagon. It's very conveniently close to pikes place and great tourist sites.
762029,40355602,2015-07-30,4707637,Andreas,"Marc's Gypsy Wagon is super cute. It was a lot of fun staying there and inspired me to build one myself!
Thanks Marc!
I can highly recommend the Gypsy Wagon."
762029,41084588,2015-08-04,5098844,Monica And Robert,"This wagon was so cool to stay in! The top bunk was the best place to sleep because the cool breeze would blow in from the window and we could hear the soothing sounds of the city at night (which I LOVED).  The wagon was perfect for us because we explored the city all day and just came back to sleep. Even though the weather was hot during the day, the wagon was nice and cool at night and we had a fan in case we needed some extra air flow.  I recommend taking the hosts advice and showering at night to avoid the morning bathroom traffic.  We found a breakfast joint nearby that we loved called Tenth West, just a ten minute walk away and so delicious! I recommend the breakfast sandwich."
762029,41935847,2015-08-10,32621427,Broderick,"The Gypsy Wagon was awesome, especially during the summer.  The location is really close to the W Wheeler street bus stop so you can go pretty much anywhere you need to go via public transportation.  When you're in the wagon, you can also look at J's Garden, rabbits, and chickens. It's a pretty cool sight to see!"
762029,42425702,2015-08-13,17138191,Carolina,My boyfriend and I landed in Seattle from Europe where we had planned to stay at Jean Marc s gypsy wagon but unfortunately when we landed I was feeling feverish and unwell so we prefered to stay at some friends house. Jean Marc was however very nice double checking on us and giving us suggestions on places to visit in the area!
762029,42846449,2015-08-16,20504919,Eivind,What a great place - the Gypsy Wagon is awesome! Everything as described. Good location to get downtown or to Ballard/Fremont. Jean-Marc was a very accommodating host. 
762029,44437857,2015-08-26,37069557,Joan,"What else more could I have needed?my stay felt so relaxing. Quiet, pretty. The other little wagon next door was rented, but I wouldn't have known if I wasn't told. Both a fan and a heater and electricity there, and even WiFi. Whole Foods a short walk away, as is a bus stop to go downtown. Loved looking at Jean Mark's garden too."
762029,45382577,2015-09-02,37827491,Tim,"The listing was accurate, and the fan and the heater in the wagon was very useful. I was surprised how cool in temperature the wagon was. 

Having it right by two bus lines was incredibly handy. We spent most of our time downtown and the D Line went right there. 

We didn't really see any one else that was staying in the yard, but the rabbits and chickens were great. 

The hosts were very welcoming. 

"
762029,45661862,2015-09-05,17161106,David,"Everything was wonderful.  A really unique place to stay in a pretty backyard with a great view.  Jean-Marc greeted us and told us to let him know if we needed anything.  We didn't, as everything went smoothly.  I'd just make future guests aware that it's a pretty small space--the only room for bags is on the other bunk, but if you know what you're getting into it's fine.  I'm not sure about the public transportation, since we had a car, but it's a quick 10 minute drive to central Seattle (traffic notwithstanding).  All around great experience, would highly recommend."
762029,46127408,2015-09-08,8072334,Sue,Jean-Marc was an AMAZING host! He welcomed us and chatted a bit which made us feel very at home. The gypsy wagon was perfect. Very clean with extremely comfy beds. The bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
762029,47408047,2015-09-18,16550538,Isobel,"Jean-Marc, his wife Maggie, and their adorable daughter made our stay so enjoyable with their warmth and openness. They have truly created a little oasis in the middle of Queen Anne. I was impressed with the spaciousness of the gypsy wagon even though on the outside it appears small. Like other guests have noted, it doesn't get too hot because there is a fan as well as stained-glass windows that open out onto the garden. My friend & I especially loved the animals (chickens, dog and bunnies), they really added to the charm of the property. "
762029,47992985,2015-09-22,40740528,Jasmine,"This was the perfect stay for my cousin and my Washington trip. The stay was incredibly enjoyable and was exactly what we needed. It was like we walked into a fairytale every time walked into Jean-Marc's backyard. The wagon is how it was described (but even more beautiful). I didn't meet Jean-Marc or his wife in person but we were in the wagon by 10:30pm each night and gone for the day no later than 7:30am each morning - which is probably why we never met. 

Some notes:
My cousin and I had small carry-on luggage and personal items (four total bags) and I'm not sure how anything other than small bags would fit into the wagon.

We parked in the cul de sac - not sure if that's where we were supposed to park but it worked out fine, we didn't get a ticket. 

The blankets in the wagon are EXTREMELY warm and soft. The evenings in Seattle were very cold but the blankets kept both of us at a perfect temperature. We didn't use the heater (although there was one available) because the blankets were perfect. 

We took an Uber to DT Seattle one night and it cost a little less than $9. I highly recommend choosing Jean-Marc's cute abodes. The location is perfect for whatever you are planning on doing. It's not far from the highway, down town Seattle, and only about 20 minutes from the airport. Plus, it took only 3 hours to go to (website hidden). Helens, 2.5 for Mt. Rainier, and 2.5 for Olympia State Park. Wonderful.

It's a perfect oasis. "
762029,48203517,2015-09-24,15940240,Audrey Jo & Paul,This place was super cute and cozy. Great AirBnb option! Good location. Jean-Marc was very welcoming.  Very cool set up!
762029,48548567,2015-09-27,24668070,Jamie,This BnB was fantastic. Described perfectly and in an awesome neighborhood. We even were able to walk to a farmers market!
762029,49797790,2015-10-06,8431785,Brendan,"Let me start by saying this listing definitely lived up to some high expectations.  The wagon was cozy and beautifully made, the rabbits are hilariously adorable and you're encouraged to pet them.  The location is great, the hosts are very hands-free and have obviously got their operation down to a science.  Everything was clean, the rules reasonable, and our stay was hindrance-free.

We did have a small dispute with the host the morning after we left.  Since our unit had two beds we didn't think it would be an issue for a friend to crash with us the last night of our five-night stay.  Once on the road home the next morning I opened my email to find an extra $85 fee from the hosts with a curt, somewhat accusatory message attached.  Admittedly we were in the wrong, we realized we should have cleared it with them first (in our defense this was our first AirBnB) so we agreed to pay the fee.  But I feel it's worth noting that neither the printed booklet in our unit or, at the time of this writing, the online listing say anything about extra guests.  We also felt it could have been resolved a little more smoothly.  They did attempt to contact us that night, but only through the AirBnB site and at the time we were exhausted from a long trip and our phones were dead.  They could have easily come out and knocked on the door and discussed it in person.  They also said something about watching us through the security cameras, which made us a little uncomfortable.

Handy tip: make sure and pack sandals.  The grass gets wet at night and you might end up back in bed with muddy feet after a late night bathroom trip."
762029,49968323,2015-10-08,25282709,Jeanette,"The wagon was exactly as pictured. The D line bus literally stops at the base of their street. As said in the listing, it can get noisy with local traffic, but not unbearable. Other than 2 short responses to questions and briefly seeing JM on our second last day, we had no contact with our host and were left to come and go as we please. Thanks for having us."
762029,51427973,2015-10-20,36277426,Hailey,"This was my second time staying with Jean-Marc and my mom's first time in Seattle. Accommodations were as expected, check in and out was super easy and the location is perfect for a visit to the city. I love staying in the wagons, it kind of feels like camping."
762029,51796017,2015-10-24,21990126,Jason,"Everything was great, clean accommodations, private bathroom, close to transit. Would definitely love to stay again, "
762029,51943426,2015-10-25,45332063,Carolyn,"I absolutely loved the gypsy wagon, and had a wonderful stay hosted by Jean-Marc. Jean-Marc provided all the amenities needed to have a comfortable stay including fresh/clean towels and sheets and a heater in the wagon and restroom. The scenery is beautiful and the location is convenient for visiting downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay at the gypsy wagon again if I get the chance! Definitely"
762029,52284596,2015-10-27,28136738,Federico,"Awesome. Probably this is not for everyone, as you might dislike having to walk outside under the rain to go to the restroom, or might dislike that the room is (as expected) very small; but if you understand those points, you will have a beautiful time (website hidden) is very nice and friendly, and the wagon he built looks and feels beautiful, warm and cosy. Definitely, we spent some great and unique time here."
762029,52468617,2015-10-29,4795315,Franklin,"Great spot, beautiful and unique structures, and a very nice and welcoming host! Overall a good, quality experience."
762029,54880121,2015-11-25,3069712,Charlie And Wendy,The communication prior to arrival was great. Everything was in order when we arrived. The room is small. We slept very well. The bus route was really convenient. We had a great time. Nice rabbits and chickens.
762029,55366674,2015-12-01,26453583,Miu,It was a nice stay at jeans place. I enjoyed it!
762029,55974953,2015-12-07,8882893,Jenn,"We had a great stay! Everything we needed was readily accommodated with no need to reach out to Jean-Marc. He was very responsive with pre-arrival inquiries. Our wagon was warm and cozy, and communal bathroom very clean and homey. The wagon is a bit small, but perfect if you don't intend on being inside of it all day. Bring a warm jacket and comfortable shoes for times you need to run to bathroom (very very very close to wagon so a super short run). Would totally recommend! "
762029,58146498,2016-01-01,8262574,Sandy,"This is my second stay with JM, and it was as awesome as the first. Such a cool space, perfect location, great price for someone who is looking for safe, warm, and fun without all the unnecessary space. Highly highly highly recommended."
7455068,41705902,2015-08-08,40322666,Mario,"Francesco was very warm and welcoming.  He checked in with us every day to make sure we were at ease.  I would highly recommend this location for a summer get-a-way in the NorthWest.  Feels like newport beach on the sound.  Very close to restaurants, bars and Alki Strand."
7455068,44034834,2015-08-23,41120742,Roberto,"Everything was exactly as described. Very clean and accommodating, and Francesco made himself available if there were any issues. I had no issues, and enjoyed my stay. Very convenient location to the beach in Seattle, and a good experience! "
7455068,44954143,2015-08-30,40138905,Robert,had a great time awesome location.
7455068,45638093,2015-09-04,13349436,Kelly,"The place was exactly as listed and is in an incredible location in Alki Beach.  It is not difficult to find, and the area is fairly quiet for beinh near bars and restaurants.  There are quite a few nearby, as well as shops and little cafes.  My favorite was Ampersand Cafe between 58th & Marine.  Pay close attention to this listing, there is no WiFi at the location but plenty of the places nearby offer it up for free.  If you're going to cook at this listing, be sure to bring all the essentials you'll need.  They have coffee filters, salt, pepper, dishes, pots & pans.  Parking - no free parking at the location (as listed) but parking is allowed on the street.  They were doing road work while I was there though, so there were restrictions with towing notices.  So, just be careful!  I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone I know and even those I don't :P  The owner was very communicative and quite helpful with my last minute reservation.  Thanks for the great listing Francesco!"
7455068,45975597,2015-09-07,39909032,Adam,"From the first correpondence, Francesco was attentive and answered all questions quickly. The bungalow is in a great location on Alki, less than a block from the beach and restaurants. The house and furnishings were just perfect for our stay (kitchen, living room, 1 bed/1 bath). Definitely recommend this place as your base camp while staying in Seattle."
7455068,46401759,2015-09-10,13535371,Joe,Francisco was a great host... Recommend highly!
7455068,46646095,2015-09-12,2946673,Arwen,"This was a perfect place at a great price!
It is exactly as described. Right off the beach, walking to lots of fun places. Francesco was very easy to get in touch with, although we never met. The apartment has basic amenities, including a coffee pot and some basic cookware. The bed was soft but comfortable.
I would definitely stay again, when heading to West Seattle.
(I recommend having perfect weather too, like we happened to have during our stay!)"
7455068,47392545,2015-09-18,32213637,Erin,"I absolutely loved staying here! It was just the right size for me! Perfect! Francesco was extremely nice and I really liked that he was around if I needed him, which I didn't but still, I thought it was really nice that he checked up on me. This place is very close to the beach - a short walk and also a short walk to the shops and cafes around the corner as well. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle. "
7455068,48603979,2015-09-27,130615,Nawras,"Although I didn't meet Francesco, It was a pleasure to stay at his place, the place is described and very clean, it was close to a lot of nice places to eat and the beach. 

Francesco checked in to make sure everything is going well. 

To me, the only down sides are not having wifi  or the usual Airbnb personal touch which might be a good thing for some people. 

Overall a very good experience and is very recommended. "
7455068,49042072,2015-09-30,43820105,Rosemarie,"The host was very helpful and receptive. The neighborhood was peaceful and pleasant, and the accommodations were all to our liking.  Everything we needed was adequately supplied."
7455068,50450124,2015-10-12,40720150,Patrick,Great experience. The apartment was very clean and less than a block from the beach. There are multiple restaurants and coffee shops also within walking distance. Would highly recommend.
7455068,53254464,2015-11-07,32364336,Molly,I rented this condo for a coworker who was staying for an extended work trip. He said that the owner was very nice and shared the wifi password. He was very happy to stay there for 3 weeks.
7455068,53901305,2015-11-14,37253466,Bryn,"Francesco was a wonderful host. Although we did not meet in person, he was very patient, professional and available when I had trouble booking my stay. He also checked in several times to make sure I had everything I needed. The space was exactly as described and very comfortable and close to the water and restaurants. Note that there is no internet service and street parking wasn't always available directly outside the space, but could be found less than a block away.
I would definitely stay again in the future! Thanks Francesco!"
7455068,55317415,2015-11-29,49878905,Krish,"Yes, my host was friendly over text. I never checked in for other reasons (the complexities of travel during the holidays), but he was kind throughout the process."
7455068,58697946,2016-01-03,48537368,Kim,"This small apartment presents in person as it does in pictures and is less than a block from good places to eat and a great view.  The private entry to the rental is nice.  The kitchen has the basics for a pleasant stay.  It was good to have a separate bedroom with a closet to hang cloths.  I could see coming here for a longer stay easily.

It was a quiet and cozy place and I would be happy to stay there again some time.

The house is located in a quiet and safe neighbourhood and not far from the next Bus Stop. You can reach Downtown within 30 minutes. The room on main floor has everything you need with a nice shared bathroom. "
2187906,18598866,2014-08-28,10532304,Shelly,Bob was easy to get in touch with and willing to provide directions and assist with travel information. His house wasn't far from the bus stop which runs downtown. The location is in a safe neighborhood with eateries and coffee shops nearby. He was willing to meet me early so that I could drop off my stuff. Overall great experience! I would recommend staying at his house:-)
2187906,19172381,2014-09-07,20623951,Kelley,Bob and his family are awesome. Listen to his recommendations about where to go in Seattle!! He knows all of the inexpensive and worth it places. I wish I could have spent more time at his place. Also his home is in a great location with many good restaurants and sweet shops. The room looked exactly like the pictures and it was an overall a great deal. I would definitely stay there again.  
2187906,19308062,2014-09-09,11165578,Chris,"Bob's place served me well. I needed a place to crash for a night in Seattle and he responded to me very quickly on short notice. He made me feel at home and the room, bed and bathroom were all nice."
2187906,36418247,2015-06-28,33937719,Sarah,"I spent an amazing time at Bob house, he was really nice, really funny and he always did his best to make us comfortable ! If you need a place to stay in Seattle go to his house ! "
2187906,44141014,2015-08-24,6067506,Pouneh,I had such a wonderful stay with Bob and his family. Everyone was so pleasant and helpful. I was in and out a lot as I only had a couple of days to explore Seattle so our paths didn't cross too often but everyone was so sweet when we did. The room was perfect and as described. Big comfy bed and super convenient having the bathroom in there as well. It is the main bathroom of the house but we never even crossed paths with its use. The buses were close to take you right into downtown Seattle and the neighborhood was safe. It was perfect. 
2187906,44484376,2015-08-26,41489078,Drea,"Bob is a great host, and his ""Seattle trip advisor"" is a great plan for exploring the city. 
Lovely room, safe neighbourhood wonderful family. "
2187906,44714282,2015-08-28,36539547,Hector,"Bob was a great host who was completely ready for us when we arrived. Clean towels, and a comfortable bed were awaiting our arrival. Thanks for helping make our vacation so memorable!!"
2187906,46022725,2015-09-07,29965539,Crystal,Bob and his family were very welcoming. The room was just right for our few days in seattle. Quiet area but super close to businesses on greenwood.
2187906,46257202,2015-09-08,25402613,Tim,"Bob was very communicative during the day leading up to my stay. The house is in a nice neighborhood, parking right outside. The room was clean and has its own private bath inside. Would definitely book again."
2187906,47203996,2015-09-16,21730644,Carolina,Bob and his family were very welcoming and communication was easy. The room was very comfortable and I had everything I needed. Thanks for the easy stay!
2187906,47685296,2015-09-21,30808123,Anna,Bob was very welcoming and showed us the ropes of staying at his house. The room was exactly as pictured. 
2187906,51002580,2015-10-16,39334793,Grace,Bob was very accomodating for a last minute reservation --- the room smelled kind of weird and the shower/bathroom situation was kind of concerning. Maube would be great for a single male traveller - the price was right
2187906,52559546,2015-10-30,9965541,Daniel,Bob was a great host! He was super welcoming and provide me would a safe comfortable room. Beats the hell out of any hotel I've stayed in. You'll enjoy your stay!
2187906,54050815,2015-11-15,35782753,Christopher,"Bob was an awesome host. Room was perfect. Location is ideal for getting around Seattle easily. Very pleasant family. Comfortable bed, really cool house and great conversation. "
2187906,54633965,2015-11-22,16201918,Toni,"Bob communicated well with me before hand by text and met me out front in the dark the first night. Very helpful.  I arrived late both nights so didn't see much of him.  Had a lovely chat with his wife the morning I left. Everything was fine and the price was right.  Very good location and a comfortable, interesting house."
2187906,55083458,2015-11-27,6839042,Rachel,"Fantastic family to stay with... Almost felt like we were part of the family during our short stay. Made us feel so at home. Bob genuinely wanted to be more than just a host with a spare room, it was nice to have a host who interacted and wanted to get to know us. Compared to all the other Airbnb's I've stayed with, Bob has been the most helpful in terms of giving us suggestions of places to see, recommendations where to eat, and info on Seattle itself. "
2187906,55264374,2015-11-29,32435141,Peter,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Bob's place for three days. We enjoyed his family's company. Bob earnestly showed us where to go and the tips in the city, and we had several nice short chats. We also enjoyed the environment of the house: clean, cozy and warm. good to be recommended."
2187906,56233476,2015-12-10,4746283,Nadine,Great host. Accomodated my last minute booking. Thanks Bob!
2187906,56967746,2015-12-20,47848541,SungHo,Bob is  great host! He is very kind. Room is very nice and clean.
2187906,57174027,2015-12-22,17648815,Nick,"Bob has a very quant home in Ballard. The neighborhood was enchanting. Bob was very friendly and very informative, even though he couldnt point me in the direction of a 'Seattle style' hotdog. ;) I would recommend Bob's flat, if for nothing else, for the shower."
3835995,17603861,2014-08-14,11185296,Scott,"Jamie and David were home when I arrived and gave me a tour/orientation of the basement apartment. They provided a Keurig and a Brita water filter in addition to the stuff in the listing, and they made me feel welcome with tips about local coffee shops, bakeries, and microbrews. We had a lovely conversation when I checked out, as well, and Jamie was responsive to my suggestions for additional items (e.g. tissues). The cottage has Craftsman architecture, lovely landscaping, and sits in a quiet residential neighborhood near Phinney Ridge. Despite the peaceful surroundings, it's a great home base from which to see Seattle... only 20 minutes by car or bus to downtown and 10 to the quirky main drags of Ballard and Fremont. Would absolutely recommend to anybody planning a visit."
3835995,17666517,2014-08-15,19865678,Lindsay,"Jamie was so accommodating and such a wonderful host!  We loved staying here and would definitely stay again next time we come to Seattle.  We rented a car and it was an easy drive into the city, but Jamie told us there is a bus nearby, too.  I highly recommend staying here, especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but still have a quick, easy route to downtown.  We spent one night exploring the Fremont area on 36th ave that has really cool restaurants and bars.  Walkable from Jamie's if you want to explore the surrounding neighborhood.  Highly recommended!!"
3835995,17732860,2014-08-16,19523214,Gina,"This place was great!!  Everything was as described plus some extras-- Jamie left us a bottle of wine, a few beers in the mini-fridge, and even some delicious chocolates to snack on for our stay.  The bed was SO comfortable we didn't want to get up in the morning!  There were plenty of games, books, and puzzles to entertain ourselves with (we ended up playing a lengthy backgammon game while drinking wine).  Jamie was accommodating and friendly; she let us check in early and gave us suggestions for things to do around the area, of which there were plenty (awesome location with restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and parks within walking distance).  If we ever come back to Seattle we are definitely looking her up-five stars!!"
3835995,17898576,2014-08-18,7916718,Sheryl,"Jamie's Ballard craftsman is so adorable! The basement apartment was perfectly clean. Jamie was quite accommodating, providing a wifi password, plenty of clean towels, k-cups for coffee, water, and dishes. A bonus: The bed was super comfortable!! I highly recommend staying here! "
3835995,18037188,2014-08-20,63815,Ruth,"Wow, great location in Ballard.. Close to everything but far enough away to feel private. This basement apartment has everything you need for a stay in town. Cozy bed, plenty of towels, a large fridge and a little sitting area. "
3835995,18273342,2014-08-24,19756663,Shahin,"My boyfriend and I booked this accommodation for 3 days in August.  
The place looked exactly like the pictures - private, cute, cozy, and clean, so there were no surprises.  The place was really lovely, and our hosts were very generous with towels and well needed toiletries.  The neighbourhood is a nice residential and close to bus stops that is approx 15 - 20 min downtown with some nice restaurants and shops also a few blocks away.
We like walking and exploring the city like a local, so this wasn't a problem for us.  We noted the suite did not have a t.v. which we thought odd at first, however in the end, we didn't have the time or interest to watch t.v. Plus, we had a laptop and setting up wifi was very fast and easy.  We enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend.  My first time using airbnb was positive experience overall, on account of our hosts, who I should mention were easy to get in touch with if we had any questions and made the check in /check out process really straightforward."
3835995,18357820,2014-08-25,8474542,Dayo,Jamie and David were absolutely wonderful. The apartment was very clean and presentable. It was cozy and perfect for the overnight my parents had planned. I got in touch with Jamie and David before my parents checked in to inform them that they were staying at this place for their 40th anniversary! They were super helpful and allowed me to drop off flowers and arrange some fruit and cheese at the apartment before they arrived. When I came back and dropped my parents off? They had arranged a personal card and a bottle of wine to congratulate my parents! They were just fantastic and I couldn't say enough about how much my parents loved the place. I absolutely recommend this as a great place to stay.
3835995,18461667,2014-08-26,2259293,Meghan,This was a lovely space.  Very clean and they even put out a bottle of wine for us.  $12 uber ride from downtown makes this a steal.
3835995,18574492,2014-08-28,18672595,Juana Mae,"Very quaint and cozy, beautiful hardwood floor and beautiful home. The bed is very comfortable and there are lots of book and games to entertain. All the amenities you need are available. Jamie is very pleasant, too! Definitely an enjoyable stay!"
3835995,18747085,2014-08-31,19874292,Jocelyn,Lovely accommodations and a friendly host available when needed. Place was just as it was described. We will definitely keep them in mind for future travels. 
3835995,18827001,2014-09-01,10681807,Rebecca,"Good location in Seattle, really liked the neighborhood. Although it was a short stay the place was cute and just what I needed for one night"
3835995,18903926,2014-09-02,8038979,Linda,"Good experience! The apartment was easy to find, great location, very clean, and well equipped. We didn't get to meet Jamie but she is a good communicator, letting us know the code for the lockbox. 

Will definitely stay there again! "
3835995,19097541,2014-09-06,165093,Jennifer,"Jamie was absolutely wonderful. The apartment is perfect. We loved the location, the house was spotless and we were made to feel most welcome. Jamie left us a bottle of wine, a little chocolate, coffee.. the bed was sumptuous. It's easy to get around the area with a lot of places in walking distance. We enjoyed meeting Jamie. It's obvious that she has put a lot of effort into making her place a wonderful airbnb experience for travelers.
Thank you, Jamie!"
3835995,19146487,2014-09-07,870932,Katherine,Great place to stay while in Seattle! Jamie and her husband were really lovely and made us feel really welcome. We will definitely stay again while in Seattle!
3835995,19216651,2014-09-08,19783939,Sydney,I booked Jamie's place for my parents to stay in prior to going on an Alaskan cruise. It was perfect for their short stay and Jamie even offered to drop them off at the cruise terminal. The place is very neat and tidy with a great location in Ballard.
3835995,19279668,2014-09-09,19803868,Beata,The description of the apartment and the neighborhood was perfect. Thank you Jamie for sharing your home with us. We only spent one night but we could have spent more if we had the time :)  We will definitely book with you next time we are in Seattle.
3835995,19349299,2014-09-10,20992836,Greer,"Jamie was an excellent host! We arrived much later than planned and she was more than happy to accommodate our schedule.  There was a bottle of wine set out for our arrival, the towels were soft, and the bed extremely comfortable.  It was wonderful to stay in such a book-filled rental without the distraction of a television.  The rental was clean and cozy and we hated to have to leave after just one night!  We will absolutely be stay again when our travels take us back to the Seattle area!"
3835995,19377836,2014-09-11,20284749,Marc,"I would recommend this to anyone! Great location - close enough to Ballard to be convenient (and with easy access to downtown) but tucked just a block or two off the main drag, making it feel quiet and relaxing. The photos and descriptions were spot-on. Very clean and welcoming. We got a great night's rest. Ran into Jamie briefly as we were leaving and she gave us a lead on an outstanding local breakfast spot. We had a wonderful time!
"
3835995,19534503,2014-09-14,18920734,Kathy,"I loved the space that Jamie had for us. It was a private basement unit with all the amenities that we needed for our 3 night stay. She even set out a bottle of wine and chocolates for us. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and updated. Best of all, it was quite :) Jamie was also very helpful- offering suggestions on where to dine and great places for sunsets. And if we needed anything, she was pretty much available. We would definitely come back and book again. "
3835995,19784616,2014-09-18,20314454,Daniel,"Very cozy and conveniently located.  Close to public transportation, nightlife, good food, and micro breweries. Jaime was an amazing host. Very helpful and friendly. Apartment had all the comforts of home. Just an all around good experience. My wife and I will be staying here exclusively for all future visits to Seattle. "
3835995,19942746,2014-09-21,19106704,Lindsey,"Perfect little pad, great location and very hospitable hosts!  Jamie couldn't have been nicer during our stay!  Although, we were on the move most of our trip, we were able to chit chat with Jamie and her husband the morning of check out.  Bed was very comfortable, apartment was very clean with everything you need for a few nights stay.  I would highly reccommend to anyone working with Jamie and staying at her humble abode!  If and when we come back to Seattle, we would definitely enjoy staying at this Ballard Charmer again! "
3835995,20047719,2014-09-22,21010418,Suzanne,"The apartment in Jamie's lovely craftsman house is just as nice as in the photos!  The place was spotless and the bed is very comfortable.  Jamie was a good communicator.  She let me chose the code on the lockbox but was home when we arrived so gave us a quick tour.  The neighborhood is quiet, near Ballard and Fremont, and parking off street in Jamie's driveway was a bonus.  We will definitely stay here again when visiting our daughter in Fremont!"
3835995,20239887,2014-09-26,20369829,Danaan,The space was quiet and cozy. Jamie was very welcoming. It was a great place to unwind after busy days exploring the city.
3835995,20296509,2014-09-27,20779828,Brenda,"What you see is what you get. I was delighted by the cottage, it is exactly like the pictures. Jamie is a lovely host and has all sorts of little things that make it feel homey. She also knows the area very well and helped us find our way when we were lost. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. The cottage is super clean and I felt safe staying alone. It was a lovely little get-away. "
3835995,20366070,2014-09-28,21026973,Betsy,"Beautiful place, very clean, very private, excellent bed, great shower, remarkably quiet for Seattle, nice accommodating hosts who laugh at your jokes, parking, good book selection, reasonable price -  what's not to like?  "
3835995,20570809,2014-10-01,1437274,Cecilia,"I booked this room for my parents. The biggest draw was location: just a few blocks from my house, in a quiet area well-served by buses to downtown. My parents reported that everything was spanking new and their hostess very welcoming. Communication was great and I felt assured my parents were well taken care of. Thanks!"

Great neighborhood; very safe, quiet, and neighbors are friendly. The charmer itself is very sweet and comfortable. It looks exactly like the pictures. We love the colorful interior and all the little decors. Location and transportation is convenient. We took the bus which is 3 blocks away to and from the zoo and Ballard Lock, each ride is about 10 minutes. We also used Uber and Lyft to get around. About $10-14 dollars from the Charmer to Downtown Seattle, International district, and UW.  Jamie is a very thoughtful host. She provides this very cool coffee/tea maker with a great variety of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. She also left us a bottle of wine. Thank you Jamie for such an enjoyable experience!!!   "

It is very clean and cozy, the heat lamp in the bathroom being an extra special touch on cool mornings!  Jamie was available by phone and offered lots of suggestions from coffee shops to sight-seeing.  She is a welcoming host.
I recommend Ballard - though it is a ~30 min bus ride downtown, the Ballard and Freemont areas are charming and a great place to explore.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe."
3835995,22750609,2014-11-13,1814035,Toni,My stay at Jamie's place was short and quite sweet. It is well located in a wonderful neighborhood. The bed is cozy and the shower is great. Had it not been a work night for me I would have indulged in the lovely wine Jamie had waiting for me. This is definitely a place to add to your wish list. 
3835995,22903368,2014-11-17,21231851,James F.,Jamie Ballard Craftsman has provided a wonderful experience on our recent visit to Ballard area of Seattle.  The space is magnificently appointed with close attention to every detail.  We hope to stay again on our next visit with family in this great part of Seattle.  Don't miss the Sunday market in downtown Ballard!
3835995,23161556,2014-11-24,22779798,Sierra,"The space is super cozy, cute, clean and is exactly as described. The neighborhood is great too, and there are many bus stops around. Jamie was an excellent host and made sure we were comfortable."
3835995,23213673,2014-11-25,6949029,Judith,"The apartment was very nice and accurately described in the listing.  Jamie provided parking in her driveway eliminating search for a parking space on the street.  The provisions for a light breakfast or snack were a very nice touch.  The location was very convenient-- close to Ballard and Fremont and convenient to downtown.  Jamie is a very nice host, very responsive to text messages and e-mails, and provides many nice touches in the apartment.  I recommend this listing."
3835995,23324593,2014-11-29,7190588,Fred,"Very clean and well organized, with a comfortable bed, adequate linen, blankets and heaters and such thoughtful and delectable additions as wine, chocolates and yogurt.  Completely private with off-street parking.  I was very pleased with the facilities and impressed with the foresight of my host, who, although out-of-town during my stay, left nothing to chance."

3835995,23792522,2014-12-10,4010590,Isaac,"Nice and clean apartment with lots of little amenities (soaps for shower, wine, chocolates, and yogurt in fridge).  Short ten minute walk to the main part of Ballard.  Jamie was very friendly and easy check in.  Only thing we didn't like was bed is really squeaky so if you turn at night, you wake yourself up.  Also the bed caved in in the middle, so not so comfy for two people I guess.  "
