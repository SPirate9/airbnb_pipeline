2923529,43418645,2015-08-19,8586648,Hunter,"The place was great! Bright, clean, and close to everything. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay around Fremont. Oh, and the bathroom remodel looks great. "
2923529,44766777,2015-08-29,174048,Burt,"Sarah & Katie responded right away to my initial query and were super helpful throughout. The apt is very quiet, parking is easy/no worries for you rental and it's super modern & comfy w/ lots of sunlight. The bathroom is very nice and the living room is very nice to relax in (photos all dead on). There's a great view of the Aurora bridge and its a short walk to the heart of Fremont. Overall great stay, one of my best in Seattle to date."
2923529,45238538,2015-09-01,924391,Melissa,Sarah and Katie were very responsive and a great hosts! The home looked as described and is in a great neighborhood with lots within walking distance. 
2923529,46151888,2015-09-08,14857001,Patrick,"We had a great stay at Sarah & Katie's place. The living/dining area is open and light-filled, and the bedroom is private and cozy. The hostesses were helpful and responsive throughout, and provided a plethora of suggestions for sights & activities. There was plenty of sun during our stay, so we enjoyed walking through Fremont and the plentiful stops for food and drink. We would definitely return to Seattle and would happily stay here again!"
2923529,49367651,2015-10-03,20627612,Dave,"The Fremont Sunrise View condo was everything as advertised and more.  It is a very clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay in Seattle area.  It helped make the 10 days stay for my wife and I very enjoyable. It is in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to Fremont village.  The bed was soooo comfortable we slept great after busy days and the remodeled bathroom was great.  The washer and dryer were a nice convenience. The parking space was great since we had a car but a bus or Uber ride to downtown is convenient and low cost as well.  Nearby North Queen Anne is convenient (by car) for grocery and other shops.   The information provide in your notebook was well organized and very helpful with very clear instructions on everything.  We never had to ask any questions. We highly recommend this location and look forward to our next stay when in the area again.  Thank you making your place available.  "
2923529,50717560,2015-10-13,45963092,Margaret,I had a great time at Sarah and Katie s place It was easy to get around and I would defiantly   rent again if I was in the Seattle  area.  Having the washer and dryer was very nice as I had been traveling a while and not having to look for a laundry mat was a big plus. I also enjoy the location. Walking to everything and anything was the best.  Thank you.
2923529,53827990,2015-11-13,43908366,Christy,"The place was lovely, cozy, and overall a very pleasant stay. They have a good selection of Seattle information packed neatly into a binder, also their instructions were clear for house gadgetry which is always nice."
2923529,54682824,2015-11-22,45162137,Andrew,"We had a lovely stay, all the excellent reviews were right! Everything was clean, comfortable, and convenient (there's even a dedicated parking spot!). The apartment was very spacious, elegant and comfortably furnished and had everything we needed for a fun weekend away. We appreciated the well-organized binder with everything we needed to know. We had a great time! "
447523,1553016,2012-06-24,1489755,Don,"This is a great place to stay!  The room is the master bedroom which is  exceptionally large; it's also spotlessly clean with lots of light. It also feels very private and comfortable. .  
It's a shared bathroom, which isn't a problem, as the owner is very flexible about the arrangements.   
The entire house has an artistic feeling, as one can see from the pictures on the profile.  Unlike many other artistic spaces,however,  this one is extremely clean and neat.  The owner is flexible and easy to get along with, which is a major bonus.
The space is about a 30-minute bus ride from downtown.  There is a large supermarket within 10 minutes walking distance and also coffee shops in the neighborhood.  If you want to visit the major tourist spots in Seattle, you should have a car.  If you want a good space to relax and unwind, this room is an excellent choice."
447523,1564171,2012-06-25,2716107,Greg,"Jasper was very accommodating, and the room was clean, comfortable, and private."
447523,1737131,2012-07-17,1102082,Jess And Josh,"We had a really restful stay at this little Seattle bungalow. The room and living space were clean and well-kept, our host was very considerate and gave us great tips on local restaurants and events, and the large backyard gave our little pup a fun space to chase tennis balls. "
447523,2420960,2012-09-26,3354346,Nico,"Perfect place to stay for a couple of days or one week (like we did). The house is amazingly cozy and very quiet and clean. We spent a great week there mostly due to the fact that the hosts are very nice, helpful and flexible. Highly recommended."
447523,2623618,2012-10-15,3774474,Beth,"This home was warm and cozy, I felt very welcome.  Her home has many unique features that were intriguing.  The bedroom was comfortable, peaceful and very quiet.  I would definitely stay here again.  The hostess was kind and accommodating.  It was a pleasure to be in her home.  "
447523,2687730,2012-10-22,3250071,Karina,"The house is a work of art and every wall tells a story. It's also a very clean place, and the room was spacious, tidy, and quiet. I slept soundly. The location is convenient: grocery stores, restaurants, and bus stops are only a few blocks away. Staying here and meeting my host (generous, flexible, respectful) was one of the highlights of my trip to Seattle. Great place, great conversation. I fully recommend this experience. "
447523,2953279,2012-11-24,4147388,Barbara,"Very comfortable bed in a truy artistic, comfortable home.  Would be happy to stay there again. "
447523,3010980,2012-12-02,4262554,Paul,"Jasper was a friendly and accommodating host. The home is comfortable, quiet, and clean. Our stay was most enjoyable.  Should we need lodging in the area again, we will stay here the next time, too. Thank you!"
447523,3575556,2013-02-18,4982942,Jenn,The room was exactly as expected! Very comfortable and home-y. The bed was very comfortable and the house silent for a great nights sleep. Overall great experience!
447523,3880179,2013-03-24,5272726,Jenn,This home has a lot of charm and the room is comfortable and cozy. Jasper is a gracious host and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle.
447523,3933175,2013-03-28,5540101,Tiffany,Artistic and comfortable are definitely spot on about the description of this home. My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed it. We were barely there only to shower and sleep and it did the job. The bed is comfortable and the house is heated. The shower pressure is great and she even gave us towels. She's very friendly and hospitable. 
447523,4088017,2013-04-08,5703267,Tamra,It was clean and quiet with lots of cool maps on the wall.
447523,4131977,2013-04-12,5208871,Sharrol,I had a comfortable and quiet  2 nights' stay with Jasper.  The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.   Jasper was very accommodating and friendly.  I would recommend staying with her at the lodge.
447523,4410012,2013-05-03,1300834,Peichi,Definitely a home away from home in  a quiet and friendly neighborhood. My husband and I stayed for over a week. We enjoyed the garden and sunny days walking down the street for fresh baked goods just a few blocks away. It's a loverly place to spend your spring/summer during a visit to Seattle and the north of Washington. 
447523,4441636,2013-05-05,5775807,David,"Jasper was a gracious host. She also was very forthcoming with the details of the current family comings/goings, so that I knew about what to expect in terms of logistics (e.g., when there will be bathroom access crunch time, etc.). The three teens living there were very considerate of my space and sleep schedule.  It's a small and cozy home with a wonderful eclectic vibe. I recommend it for a casual stay in NE Seattle. "
447523,4523858,2013-05-10,3842954,Nicole,"It was absolutely perfect--a comfortable room in a house filled with art and personality close to the U district. My husband and I could not have been more pleased. Jasper is a gracious, accommodating hostess and a very cool woman. I would recommend it to anybody. This has been my second experience with AirBNB and I never want to stay in an impersonal, overpriced hotel again. "
447523,4558571,2013-05-12,3530159,Carol,"Jasper's home is colorful and restful.  Even though in a Seattle neighborhood, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful.  A fish tank burbled softly in the living room and the trees in the backyard were home to birds that sang in the morning.  No dogs or cats to pet, but as I stood at the kitchen sink, I watched two squirrels foraging in the flower box on the other side of the window--nice way to start the day as I drank my espresso.  Like a little woodland island in the city.  Easy access to main streets and bridges to the other side of Lake Washington.  As description mentions, lots of coffee shops and grocery stores blocks away.  Jasper has a great smile and hearty laugh, and we talked on and on about travel, education, and life in general.  "
447523,4656720,2013-05-18,5208871,Sharrol,"My husband says his stay at Jasper's home was very pleasant.  The bed is very comfortable and Paul says it is "" quiet and restful"" at this residence."
447523,4798083,2013-05-26,6563518,Cody,"I needed a place to crash on extremely short notice (and on a Friday night) due to a scheduling conflict with a friend I was staying with. I'd never used airbnb before and knew it was sort of a roll the dice situation given the timeframe. Thankfully, Jasper was willing to put me up for the night in spite of this and I cannot thank her enough for that.

Like the host the home itself was charming, neat, and welcoming. Though my experience was brief I'm glad to have had it and would highly recommend this host to anyone visiting Seattle."
447523,4896605,2013-05-31,5208871,Sharrol,"Artistic, comfortable, Seattle home is a great place to stay.  As promised, it is quiet and comfortable.  You'll be thanking this host for her hospitality."
447523,5305240,2013-06-23,1136061,Nicholas,"This was a great stay, I was in town for a marathon so was looking for somewhere quiet and comfortable to rest - which is exactly what this was. Thanks again for having me and being so welcoming!"
447523,5534207,2013-07-04,5504019,Damon,"Deb/Jasper's place is very warm and pretty and well-equipped. They are flexible and prompt to communicate. We were lucky to have the place ourselves for two days as they were out of town during 4th July period. The neighborhood is ice and quiet. It is very close to Fremont, Ballard in which have a lot of small shops and restaurant to choose from. Also it is very convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill. We'd definitely come back here in Seattle"
447523,5770568,2013-07-15,3835039,Natalia,"My husband and I spent two nights here, I t's a lovely house, the owner was very kind and accommodating. The bedroom is really big and comfortable, with a lot of light. The house is in a really nice and quiet neighborhood. Everything worked smoothly and I would recommend to stay here to anyone. The only disadvantage for us was that it is a bit far away from the main attractions, like the Pike Market or even the university area. Specially if you will be using public transportation, be aware that you might take at least 45 minutes to get to downtown for example. Also during weekends, the bus frequency is lower and there are not a lot of bus choices. For us wasn't a super big deal, we just wanted to have a relax weekend and we made it! Thanks Jasper!"
447523,5953576,2013-07-23,2938390,Anton,The host was very nice and accommodating to our needs. The house was cozy and the room was very neat and tidy. The vicinity was peaceful and quiet. The bed and pillow were comfortable and I had no trouble falling asleep. My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we were glad to have picked this place over the neighboring hotels. We highly recommend this place.
447523,6035641,2013-07-27,7521708,Justin,"Deb / Jasper was very nice and welcoming. Her house was as it looks in the pictures - unique, artistic, and somewhat rustic. The bedroom was spacious and cozy, and the bed was comfortable. Her home is located within a 10-20 minute drive to downtown and all the other popular areas surrounding downtown. Deb was pleasant to talk to, and gave me some site-seeing tips, since this was my first visit. She also gave me plenty of privacy. I enjoyed the stay very much! "
447523,6928736,2013-08-30,8401369,Alex,"Jasper was a friendly and accommodating host. The home is comfortable, quiet, and clean. The bed was comfortable, the house was artistic. Would definitely be happy to stay there again."
447523,7125789,2013-09-07,8473568,Lil,"Jasper's home is in a quiet and safe, transit accessible neighborhood; exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for. It's very comfortable and cozy, a wonderfully warm atmosphere filled with character, both in home and host. Jasper very kindly answered our questions and helped us out when we were looking for things to do. There are grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacy, coffee shop, as well as a post office close by, so all basic needs are fulfilled very easily. I couldn't recommend her enough, if you're trying to find a short term place to stay that you can drive/bus/bike from, this is it!"
447523,7231411,2013-09-11,8335453,Tara,"Clean room, very kind and helpful host.  Shared bathroom. Great location close to UW and many attractions! Thanks! "
447523,7666321,2013-09-29,3354862,Charlene,The room was very comfy! And the quiet house was perfect for being in the area for work purposes. 
447523,7838991,2013-10-05,7042414,Susan,"Deb was a wonderful host, and she has a lovely home. I really enjoyed my stay. There is ample street parking in the area, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. I liked the artistic touches all around the house. The room was clean and comfortable. It was nice to get to speak with Deb and learn about the neighborhood. I highly recommend Deb and her place."
447523,7948396,2013-10-09,3327710,Rachel,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay with Deb.  Our room was very peaceful and comfortable, and the neighborhood felt like a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.  The house was quiet, and we were mostly on our own, but it was nice to chat with Deb in the mornings and get her perspective on the area, as well as her helpful recommendations on some good 'local' things to do.  We would definitely love to have the opportunity to stay again sometime!"
447523,8057196,2013-10-14,9036594,Anne,"Comfortable bed, quiet house, lovely artistic touches everywhere.  Just what I needed!  "
447523,8399396,2013-10-28,20570412,Jessica,Wonderful hip Seattle home! Lots of space and big mirror.
447523,8669762,2013-11-11,1584056,Lauren,"Deb's home is decorated in a most enchanting and quirky style.  I didn't spend much time there as I had a very busy schedule while in town, but if you are looking for something a little fun and different - this is it!  Deb made checking in and out very easy, even though I had weird hours.  Would stay again, thanks Deb!"
447523,8974229,2013-11-29,7206118,Norio,"The room was cozy and the host was very friendly.
They were also very flexible (there are no strict rules or curfews).

I highly recommend them when you stay at Seattle!"
447523,9109582,2013-12-07,9651385,Tom,"What a great hostess. Deb was friendly and accomodating . Her place was just what a traveler  needs. Roomy, quiet and comfortable with all sorts of homey touches.  Deb was very informative and  helpful. If  you like a warm ,  inviting room ,  this  is the place."
447523,9990397,2014-01-23,1758546,Elaine,"A pleasant, very comfy one night stay in a great neighborhood.  I didn't even know that we were sharing the bathroom with Deb, she treads that lightly.  My favorite things in her layered home were the hall of maps, the globe of lights and the teeny toaster oven.  I would stay again.  "
447523,10226433,2014-02-07,3940745,Ivan,Great location!  Nice and clean room.
447523,10300534,2014-02-11,7885640,Matthew,"Upon arrival, our host told us she rents her garage (located just outside our room) to two trombone players. ""They don't play after 10:30pm,"" she reassured us. ""The music sounds like fairy foghorns."" As it happens, there was no trombone practice during our stay, so I didn't get a chance to test the accuracy of her description, but it was the kind of thing I would have liked to have known before renting the room.

There was no dedicated storage space for visitors in the room or bathroom. There was no way to have privacy, as the windows are only partially covered with light curtains and there are no shades or blinds. We were told not to wear shoes in the house.

It was clear the host made an effort to clean before we arrived, but the bathroom was not clean. The tub was grimy, with hair from previous residents left inside. I put a towel on top of the bathmat so I wouldn't have to step on it. I didn't even ask why there was a bucket of murky water in front of the toilet.

There were areas along the baseboards where holes in the wall were covered by tape and cardboard. Maybe that is how the spiders got in. All I know is how unpleasant it was in the night to feel something on my arm, turn on the light, and discover little brown spiders in the bedclothes.

If cost is your top priority, this may be the place for you. It is not someplace I would stay again.
"
447523,10711497,2014-03-03,3327710,Rachel,"It saddened and surprised me to read a recent negative review about this listing.  This is my third time selecting Deb's home when my family is in need of accommodations in the North Seattle area, and I cannot recommend her highly enough.  The house reflects Deb's love for the Pacific Northwest and beyond.  Throughout each room, tucked into each nook and cranny, you will find many artful details of her world travels.  Deb is very down-to-earth and knowledgeable about the area. She is glad to make recommendations on local sights, while also sensitive about respecting the privacy of her guests.  Regarding the recent negative review, all I can say is that we have always found our room at the house to be meticulously clean, and the bathroom to be as tidy as our bathroom at home.  We have also never had any trouble with spiders.  As with many Airbnb accommodations, this is a real, lived-in home, not a hermetically sealed hotel room.  If that works for you, you will most certainly be happy to make this your home while visiting Seattle."
447523,11164758,2014-03-23,12713640,Majid,"It is a good place for a short stay.
you will stay in a big room, the bathroom is very clean and warm.
you do not feel her presence  unless you have a question or need help.
She is very friendly and helpful."
447523,11678055,2014-04-11,6838330,Anthony,Thank you so much for the hospitality. Loved the decor of the home. Also it is in a great neighborhood. A lot of street parking. Pretty close to downtown Seattle and the university. Thanks a bunch. Hope to stay again.
447523,11782994,2014-04-14,7024959,Chris,"Deb was a great host and enjoyed staying at her home. The room and bed were very comfortable. The location is about 15 mins drive from Capital Hill, with a grocery store, and many dining choices in her area. I hope to stay there again when visiting Seattle."
447523,12567196,2014-05-05,6325498,Judy,"Deb was a gracious host, and her home is lovely.  I was very comfortable being there.  Thanks Deb!"
447523,13020280,2014-05-17,8379200,Julius,"I had a great stay at Deb’s place. As the description says, it is a house filled with art and interesting stuff. The room was clean and quiet and the house is close to the university and the National Archives. So if you’re in Seattle to work there or somewhere close you can bike there and enjoy a beautiful 15-minute commute. Highly recommended. "
447523,13052610,2014-05-18,6278468,Brian,"We enjoyed our night's stay with Deb.  Bed was good, decor is delightful and interesting to explore.  Great neighborhood.  Quiet street.  Deb gave us walking directions and recommendations for where to eat dinner.  We recommend it for anyone who needs a nice place to stay in north Seattle."
447523,13168472,2014-05-20,15500606,Nicholas,"My brother and I spent 2 evenings at Deb's place over the long weekend and really enjoyed our stay there! Deb was a great host, and the house was clean and has lots of character. The neighbourhood is great too if you're okay being a little further from downtown (we definitely preferred it that way anyways). For the price  I doubt one could find anything much nicer!"
447523,13259719,2014-05-23,15597980,Ek,"I stayed three nights in Deb's. Deb was a cool, informative person. Her niece was nice and helpful. The room I stayed was spacious and cozy to sleep. Buses frequently go to downtown, so you don't have to worry about the access to the Seattle attractions. Quality cafe and bakery are near, so you can enjoy healthy local breakfast. 

The neighborhood (Wedgwood) is very safe and quiet. As a foreigner traveling US, safe neighborhood atmosphere feels assured. Especially for foreigners visiting US for a short time, I recommend Deb's. "
447523,13712773,2014-06-02,15935494,Christian,"Deb was a friendly host and her house was adorable and arty, just as described. I am a big fan of the room I stayed in- wood floors and natural lighting are favorites of mine. Deb was accommodating of my late check-in time, which I appreciate. The internet was really crappy (like I couldnt just load google crappy). I dont know if it always is but it would have been nice to know ahead of time if issues were known. Especially because in my initial contact message I mention my need for the internet. That and that I had no space to place my shower things are my only negatives. Otherwise a great experience!"
447523,14108344,2014-06-11,6097799,Miguel,"Clean, nice big room, lots of posting. If stay here again!"
447523,14140195,2014-06-12,2146960,Natasha,"Deb was very welcoming a helpful. We only stayed for one night but the bed was comfortable and she gave us directions to where we were headed. It took about 30-40 mins to bus downtown, and 15 to drive. We would stay again! Thanks Deb!"
447523,14421285,2014-06-18,10217380,Mari,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
447523,14587042,2014-06-22,6741670,Beth,"Deb is a great host. She was helpful and accommodating. She was flexible about our arrival time. Her place really has a lot of character, is comfortable and very relaxing…it had a really relaxing energy which was much needed on our trip. "
447523,15654345,2014-07-13,2065379,Alan,"5 on a scale of 1-5!  I plan to return here the next time I come to Seattle.  Deb was extremely accommodating, everything was clean (room, bedding, towel, bathroom, shower, house), the bed was as comfortable as any hotel, the place was quiet during the night, and the neighborhood was very safe.  Deb provided an information list for the place (including wifi and nearby stores), a map for the neighborhood, and bus schedules for the closest buses.  I had a car so I can't comment on public transportation, but it was a 5 minute drive to UW, a 20 minute drive to the International District, and it seemed like less than 15 minutes to most other places.

I spent most of my time at work and visiting.  So I didn't use Deb's kitchen or living room.  The one local place I tried was ""Top Pot Doughnuts"" (3 long blocks away?) which had really good doughnuts and coffee.  

If light wakes you up, plan to start your day with the sun.  The room is on the north side of the house but the curtains are thin.

My favorite part?  The house is indeed artistic.  Unlike the last hotel room I stayed in, Deb's house contains a thousand stories.  And I'll forever remember the flyer/poster for ""donkey basketball"""
447523,16488828,2014-07-28,16346799,Raymond,Very nice home set in a very safe neighborhood in a great location. Deb is extremely hospitable and she was very flexible in terms of check-in and check-out time. The room was very quiet and comfortable as well. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a safe and comfortable place to rest while visiting Seattle. 
447523,16855809,2014-08-03,12513761,Casey,"The room was a little different than the pictures, but overall a comfortable experience. Deb was very informative and welcoming. "
447523,16955987,2014-08-04,19142366,John,Had no experience with the host.  We were able to stay with family so chose not to spend the night.  I'm sure it would have been just fine.
447523,18096521,2014-08-21,19527389,Samantha,"We were in Seattle for not the best circumstances (Memorial of a dear friend) however the neighborhood was absolutely lovely and Deb was a very kind host.  The home decor is super funky and eclectic which suits me perfectly and it had a warm, homey feel all around. If you don't need to be right downtown I definitely recommend Deb's place - easy free parking and though we didn't take transit seemed super close to major routes and neighborhood super walkable. Thanks for sharing your home with us Deb"
447523,18587889,2014-08-28,19000145,Anders,"Deb was a great host. She stayed up late to meet me upon checking in, despite being an hour later than expected (11pm). My initial hesitation with renting in shared house was the freedom to come and go as I please. That was not a problem with Deb. I came home late (being respectfully quiet) and was gone early in the mornings to attend my conference at the University of Washington  (a nice downhill 15 min bike or a direct bus to campus). Easy to get on the regional trail system (Burke Gillman) from the house, but it is a good trek to downtown.
House is located on a quiet side-street and is super cozy and comfortable to be in . Neighbourhood amenities are a short walk away. The bed was very comfortable (although the floor, or bed frame?, was a little squeaky when shifting about). But I had great sleeps with nice light filtering in the morning. Good shower with nice pressure and shower head. The kitchen was exactly what I needed, a little fridge and counter space to keep breakfast stuff. Good recycling and composting setup.
Deb and I crossed paths for brief stints in the evening or morning. Great conversations re: music, travelling, local politics. Gave great food recommendations around the UW area (Aqua Verde), provided a bike map, and has a good general wisdom of the area."
447523,19354143,2014-09-10,3426946,Anahit,Deb has the coolest house.  It has a very vintage and cabin feel to it.  Her garden outside is beautiful as well.  She was very kind and accommodating and even showed me around the neighborhood.  It was a  great place to decompress.  
447523,19571022,2014-09-14,7096296,Alina,Deb was a fantastic host and her place felt like home. We spent a very comfortable night and thanks to her neighborhood recommendations had a nice outing. Would definitely return next time I'm in the area!
447523,22149713,2014-10-31,365155,Melissa,Staying with Deb was great. I had just relocated to Seattle and needed a place to stay for a couple of weeks while I got myself settled. Deb offered great information about neighborhoods and things to do. I was so happy to have a place that felt like a home until I found a home of my own.
447523,24036254,2014-12-17,1346137,Jerome,"The ""Lodge"" was a great find.  I had lived in Seattle for 30 years and know the Wedgewood neighborhood.  I only spent a night and wished it was a longer stay.  The lodging was just what I needed and Deb is a great find too."
447523,24978646,2015-01-04,25058712,Carmen,Deb was an incredibly nice and very accommodating host. The room was fantastic and the location was just a short drive from anywhere you could want to be in Seattle. Would definitely book again! 
447523,25192118,2015-01-08,9233833,Ann,"Deb was great! Very laid back and her home was so unique, eclectic and very clean. I loved the shower and the bed was perfect with the heated mattress pad. Would definitely stay again."
447523,25259654,2015-01-10,25814816,Morgan,Deb was a wonderful host and a great private bedroom. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet but still only a 15-30min drive from downtown and all of the places we wanted to check out during our stay. The parking was convenient and right out front of the house. Thanks again deb!
447523,25812668,2015-01-26,8146236,Brenda,"Deb was a great host and balanced both helpful conversations regarding neighborhood, restaurants, etc. and also respected my privacy. The house was clean and Deb provided some little extras during my stay which were much appreciated. I would return."
447523,26029230,2015-02-01,6034195,Andree,"Deb is a wonderful host and was very friendly! I enjoyed looking at the art, photographs and loved the aquarium. Her house is in Wedgewood, one of the older and quieter neighborhoods. Starbucks and other amenities are right down the street. "
447523,26929123,2015-02-22,6325498,Judy,"I love staying at Deb's home because it is a small, very well built cozy home.  I feel safe there.  Deb is friendly and engaging.   "
447523,27302430,2015-03-01,6903424,Janna,"I really appreciated being able to book Deb's place last minute. She made everything very easy, and provided a very comfy and safe place to stay while I was in between apartments. "
447523,27853976,2015-03-13,3798437,Nomaan,"Deb's place is a very artistic place. You find a lot of cool stuff. My stay was very short, more like just crashing and heading out early in the morning but I enjoyed it. I can tell you that the mattress was one of the best mattress I have slept on. It has a built in heater that makes sleeping so comfortable! "
447523,28568071,2015-03-26,2148190,Geno,"We loved this eclectic home, with surprises in every corner. Deb was out of town when we stayed, and it was such a gorgeous port in the storm before our trip to Olympic the next day. Love the art, natural light, and beautiful neighborhood. Ample street parking, comfy bed, and a communicative hostess. We would absolutely stay again! Thank you, Deb!"
447523,29124279,2015-04-04,29367176,Yuri,"I had a great time staying in Seattle. Deb was inviting and helpful, giving some tips and pointers on where to go. The room was comfortable (as a Florida girl I loved the heated sheet!) and access to the kitchen and bathroom was easy. Seattle is particular about trash, recycling, and compost, but Deb had it all written out and it was clear and straight forward. The hot water is heated on demand, which is not a new concept for me, so it didn't bother me to have to wait a moment while the shower got hot. Everything was clean, neat, and very welcoming."
447523,30996961,2015-04-30,21178694,Dean,"Deb was and is an amazing host, very friendly, helpful and welcoming. 
 While I was in seattle I wasn't home much, but when I was she was always around to share a word, smile or a wave. 
 Definitely in the future will be in seattle again and will hopefully stay with Deb again provided she isn't fully booked up.
 Would highly recommend and suggest people to stay here."
447523,35417388,2015-06-18,23006998,Adam,Great location in a good neighborhood. The room was clean and Deb was very welcoming. Highly recommended!
447523,35592746,2015-06-20,34704023,David,"Deb was a perfect host welcoming me to her home and giving me privacy to rest and get a great night sleep.  Everything was spotless clean, and the bed very comfortable.  The large flat screen TV in the room was an especially night treat.  And having Wi-Fi access made it truly a home away from home.  Parking is plentiful on the street in a very quiet residential neighborhood.  And the location is practically a minute from a Safeway, Starbucks, and other shopping and restaurants, or an easy walk.  Very convenient from the I-5 and to the University.  A perfect retreat."
447523,36348097,2015-06-27,4211615,Mauricio,"I had a great stay, the room was very comfortable and Deb was very hospitable."
447523,36813783,2015-07-01,34729654,Christine,"This was a lovely house full of amazing things to look at. The room was comfortable, and Deb was very kind and helpful. Definitely worth the price."

447523,37611707,2015-07-08,35650470,Tom,The listing is for a bedroom and a very small shared bathroom.
447523,38792916,2015-07-18,6079899,Irena,"Deb had the most amazing little home near the University District of Seattle. You can catch the bus right into downtown Seattle in 25 minutes. I highly recommend eating at the Sunlight cafe for home-cooked vegetarian meals and excellent gluten free vegan baked goods. The actual space was definitely one of the cleanest and most comfortable rooms I have stayed in. She has a super unique space, and is a wonderful person to meet. "
447523,39506332,2015-07-24,35094812,Susan,Deb was very welcoming to me and my friend. She gave us an excellent suggestion on where to go to dinner that night. 
447523,40189049,2015-07-28,6394296,Alexis,"Our stay in Seattle was just as advertised by Deb's posting. The house was a really unique and beautiful spot in Seattle. Some great aspects were the plentiful parking which was helpful for us on this road trip. The room accommodations were really comfortable and everything we needed for our stay was provided or explained. We did not meet Deb but her son was friendly and helpful. While it was just a room, it felt very private. Definitely would recommend to friends passing through Seattle. "
447523,43878438,2015-08-22,12897900,Alice,Everything was how I expected! Deb is a nice host and very helpful. I needed to stay near UW so her place was a good option. 
447523,49721063,2015-10-05,24843087,Jayden,"The location was pleasant, quiet and the place felt a little like you were at a lodge.  Deb was helpful and the space was really relaxed.  Would stay again next time if we were looking to be a little outside of downtown Seattle.  "
447523,49964411,2015-10-07,30523777,Maura Catherine,"Her home was AMAZING !! Cute,Kitschy, Quirky.. Definitely 1 of a kind. Deb was engaging and thoughtful! Great conversationalist. All in all a lovely stay...didn't want to leave..."
447523,50260901,2015-10-10,30523777,Maura Catherine,"Loved my stay at Debs so much, I extended my stay!"
447523,51358879,2015-10-19,45661754,Daniel,"Deb was a gracious, interesting host. Her place is cozy, the wooden planks lit by soft, thoughtfully strung lights. It is close to a grocery store, a reasonable walk to the bars and restaurants of Ravenna, and for cyclists, it is right by the Burke Gilman trail. "
447523,52150846,2015-10-26,24662663,Anna,"The room was clean and very comfortable. It was rainy and cold outside and the heated mattress cover was just the perfect thing to come home to. The street is very peaceful and  green, perfect place if you are looking for a quiet room not in the downtown craziness to have a good sleep. Deb was super kind and I had a great time chatting with her when we crossed paths. I felt absolutely welcome. "
447523,52801235,2015-11-01,5266145,Carli,"Deb gave clear directions and made me (and my dog) feel welcome. The room was comfortable and as advertised. It was, in all, a very good experience."
447523,53074649,2015-11-04,28944689,David,Deb was friendly and welcoming. We were pleased with the accommodations and neighborhood. 
447523,54021845,2015-11-15,47746871,Michelle,"Great place to stay.   Deb made the stay easy, very comfortable and welcoming.  Great location for my needs.   Easy to find and get around town from."
7679928,41703634,2015-08-08,39656673,Jocagraca,"Eric was such a nice host, he is a really laid back guy that offered me his facilities for my free usage. He offered me not only the room but also the kitchen and his deck. All the information of his post is accurate. I would definitely use his room again in the future."
7679928,45711501,2015-09-05,40540760,Ravil,"The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. The bus stop was a block away from Eric's house. Close to the city, very convenient place. Eric and Pam, they are great people. They explained us how to get around the city easily and also which neighborhoods are good to live in, (website hidden) and my girlfriend enjoyed our stay at his place. "
7679928,46988417,2015-09-14,16434822,Jessica,Eric was very friendly and welcoming.  It was a perfect place for a bachelor to stay.  
4250749,28812989,2015-03-30,5895228,Craig,The townhouse was awesome.  Great location for walking to Fremont bars and restaurants and close enough for a $5-10 Lyft ride into downtown(when the construction isn't shutting down Fremont bridge AND 99 of course).
4250749,30410012,2015-04-21,30351779,Dennis,"Nice, clean, comfortably furnished, and ready to be enjoyed.  The view of Mt. Rainier from the third floor was a pleasant bonus!  The home is just a stone's throw from a very busy highway so the traffic noise may be a bother for some.  That same highway puts you in downtown in just a few minutes.  Everything promised was available.  Neighbors were friendly and quiet.  Coffee shop, a few resturants (including an outstanding and locally famous sandwich shop), a park, and a grocery store are all within a few minutes walk.  We had a very pleasant stay and every member of our family, young to old, would return for another visit!"
4250749,30692792,2015-04-26,2180918,Andrew,"Sea To Sky has set the standard high. Everything went so smoothly. From checking in to checkout, we had a great time. The place was immaculate. We fit 4 adults and 4 small children in the condo. There are 3 floors to this place and it makes for an awesome sound barrier for the kids who like to sleep in in the morning. Kids could play on the first floor and we would not hear a thing on the third.

Neighborhood is great. Fremont has lots of great restaurants. A handful just walking distance from the place.

The whole time we stayed there we did not see the host. But we also didn't need to either (which was great!). They provided us plenty of spare towels and linens. Internet had some problems early on before we reset the modem. Then it worked perfectly.

So nice. I would definitely come back for another few nights."
4250749,31330541,2015-05-04,11112966,Jessie,This place was perfect for our trip. The location was far better than we'd even hoped for (lots of great restaurants and cafes a block over on Fremont Ave.) The place was super clean and had everything we needed. Really loved our stay :)
4250749,33604517,2015-05-30,32721219,Jason,"Place was just as it was shown online.  Great location, very clean and quiet.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend renting from Sea to Sky!"
4250749,42516451,2015-08-14,10490036,Jacqueline,Lovely 3 bedroom town home just as described. Close to highway and quick walking access to delicious restaurants such as Paseo and Uneeda Burger. Highly recommend!
445199,1509044,2012-06-18,882210,Zack,"Eliza was a very friendly an accommodating host!  When we arrived she made us feel right at home.  Freely offered anything we needed just ask.   She had great hand drawn maps of the area to get us oriented and a very nice and thoughtful welcome letter.

When the time came that we did find we needed something, she went out of her way to help accommodate those needs.  It was very truly appreciated!

The location is a very great location, easy to get anywhere in Seattle.  Next time we come to Seattle, we will surly look up and see if the room is available again!

Thank you!!

Zack & Eric"
445199,1536932,2012-06-22,2556354,Joe,"Nice room, This was perfect for me. Minutes from my sons home in West Seattle, who doesn't room for visitors, so this work out just perfect. "
445199,1570476,2012-06-26,2630114,Shelby,"We had a wonderful stay in the Blue Room! The home is simply and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities you could need. The location is perfect for getting into Seattle and the parking was open and easy. Eliza was a friendly and relaxed host, and we very much enjoyed our conversations with her. Next time we are in the area, we would love to visit again!"
445199,1587149,2012-06-29,2356720,Beth,This is a great historic and scenic area and was a very easy drive to Seattle sights. Eliza was a gracious host.
445199,1812728,2012-07-27,2731547,Lily,The room is nice and the location is very convenient  to go to Seattle downtown  by car or by bus. 
445199,1841505,2012-07-30,2921760,Quinn,The bed was so comfy and it was great to be a few blocks from a convenience store  and one quick bus ride to downtown. Eliza was a non-intrusive host and very accommodating to our late getting in and late leaving plans. 
445199,1852189,2012-07-31,2650359,Louisa,"Eliza was very helpful, considerate, and her house is lovely!  The blue room was really comfortable, cozy, and tastefully decorated.  The location is also very convenient.  Thank you!"
445199,1865803,2012-08-01,914638,Ulrike,"Eliza is a friendly, welcoming, communicative and open-minded young lady. The room is exactly as it's shown on the pics & clean. The only thing i could mention is that it's more a 15minutes than a 5minutes ride to Downtown Seattle. Nonetheless,i would recommend staying with her and would be happy to see her again!"
445199,1905507,2012-08-06,908819,Deanne,"Staying at Eliza's home was a wonderful experience! She was very helpful with suggestions on where to go and eat. We absolutely LOVED the restaurant Eliza suggested for dinner, along with the one we all went to for brunch. Eliza is very straight forward and easy going. My two daughters and I loved discussing her career and playing with her very well-mannered pug. Eliza is very kind and we wish her the best!"
445199,1924791,2012-08-08,946224,Zahra & Clynt,Eliza was such a lovely lady. She made us feel very relaxed and welcome in her home. It was cozy and a short ride to downtown Seattle.  I would stay there again for sure!
445199,1941154,2012-08-10,266807,Stacey,Eliza was delightful and the house was charming. I stayed there two nights while exploring Seattle. Very convenient to the bus line and 5 minutes to Pike Place area and to other buses that connect to a variety of parts of the city.  Sweet Oscar was a plus. Would definitely recommend.
445199,1981953,2012-08-14,2618064,Jessica,"Eliza was a very welcoming host and has a lovely home.  Her and her sweet pooch Oscar were there to welcome us when we arrived a little later than planned.  We were made to feel at home in a light and airy room, kitted out with a pinch of retro chic.  Eliza is a cool gal - not many people have a deep sea camera rig lying around their living room!  It was great to stay with Eliza, and we'd recommend her to anyone."
445199,1995619,2012-08-15,3079625,Kristyn,Loved the blue room! I especially loved the clawfoot tub...what a fantastic way to end my day of walking around. Having time and space to play a little on Eliza's acoustic guitar was an added bonus! I even taught myself a new song because of her songbook. I'd definitely stay here again. 
445199,2011775,2012-08-17,469334,Lauren And Brian,"The place was really nice and clean and had a fun design.  Eliza was very kind and helpful with directions into the city.  Her place is a short bus ride for sure, very easy to get to the fish market and downtown!  Our stay was short, but we would definitely stay here again for a long visit if we come again."
445199,2039953,2012-08-20,2848989,Jaclyn,"Eliza is wonderful. She made us feel so welcome and very comfortable. It was great visiting with her and getting to know Oscar, what a guy!
My friend and I highly recommend Eliza's blue room and hope to return sometime there in the future."
445199,2064391,2012-08-22,1781956,Allyson,"Eliza's blue room made us feel like we were in a cottage by the sea.  From the colorful blue walls to the fisherman's lantern decoration to the aquatic maps displaying the Seattle area, it was a very quaint and comfortable place to stay.  The simplicity of the home was the best part; that and our second host, Oscar the Boston terrier:)  We loved being so close to downtown and even hanging in the peaceful backyard with the cool Summer North West breeze!  Eliza was a great host; so very sweet and accommodating.  Do yourself a favor and stay in the blue room the next time you are in Seattle!"
445199,2098211,2012-08-26,2599071,Janet,"Eliza was wonderful! She is flexible and does not have strict rules, which made us feel at home for our first trip to Seattle. The Blue Room is exactly as pictured (clean and tasteful!). We had a pleasant stay tackling all the tourist attractions as well as a couple of local spots. Oscar, the four legged roommate, is super friendly and welcomed us at the end of each day/night as if we were his owners. We will definitely stay at the Blue Room for future Seattle vacations. And as a first time Air BnB user, we will definitely use it for future vacations before looking for a hotel.

Thank you for having us!"
445199,2134638,2012-08-29,2909973,Abe,"Eliza's home was clean and cozy, like a bungalow by the sea. Her home was located right by a bus stop, and it was quick and easy getting to and from the city center. Although we didn't get to spend a lot of time with Eliza, it was clear that she is someone who has a broad worldview with eclectic interests in science, music, and travel. The other resident of the house, Oscar the dog, is sweet and adorable. I enjoyed playing with him and even now, I miss that dog."
445199,2179577,2012-09-03,495812,Kelvin,Eliza was such an accommodating host even thou we showed up at 10pm.  She' s very cool and flexible! The house is very cozy and comfortable too!  The three of us stayed in there comfortably.  One of the best parts is how she makes an effort to small talk.  A+ and highly recommend to everyone!
445199,2210418,2012-09-05,2260579,Jeanette,"Eliza's house is a great base for exploring Seattle (we drove a rental car, so we didn't experience the bus), and the blue room is clean and cozy, as is the rest of the house. Eliza is a trusting and friendly host. Her dog, Oscar, is a delight. "
445199,2329801,2012-09-17,2886399,Julia & Jasper,Eliza & her dog Oscar were wonderful hosts.  We instantly felt welcomed in her simple and stylish home. Eliza is very easy going and friendly and the room is clean and comfortable. 
445199,19148070,2014-09-07,20021329,Alyssa,"Eliza is amazing--her house is lovely, the room cozy and comfortable, and the location was perfect. She really has the gift of hospitality and we were only sad we didn't get a chance to talk to her more! Thanks again!"
445199,19327137,2014-09-10,19766922,Laurens,"Eliza has got a lovely house, very tastefully decorated. We were welcomed quite late in the evening by a very friendly hostess and a plum tree to which we could serve ourselves. Eliza even was so kind as to bring us to the train station in the morning."
445199,19427836,2014-09-12,11246748,Aja,Both my boyfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at your house. Thank you so much! I don't think our stay could have been any better. You are amazing. 
445199,19738968,2014-09-17,18895829,Tracy,"Staying at Liza's home exceeded my expectations. It was wonderful staying in West Seattle away from the hustle and bustle of the major hotel areas. Bus service is excellent and freeway access for those choosing to drive is very good as well. Even though I didn't rent a car there was plenty of parking.  Loving coffee as I do there is a great coffeehouse around the corner from her house. Liza's vintage home is very personal and peaceful with a lot lovely touches. Liza is such a sweetie, she is very knowledgeable about Seattle as well.  My stay was so exceptional that I cannot say enough positive things about staying there. "
445199,19877385,2014-09-20,16476062,Robert,"Eliza,  thank for making our stay in Seattle a perfect stay.  You have carefully prepared the room to make it easy for your visitors.  From the extra charging plugs to the shampoo and mouthwash, you definitely make the extra effort to be a great host. Thank you again.  I will email you the name of the structural engineering firm once I go back to work on Monday.  Hope to see you again soon."
445199,20020614,2014-09-22,16778790,Jacqueline,"Eliza was such a helpful host and very pleasant to be around. She goes the extra mile to make you feel at home. We loved the setup of the house: simple, clean, and tranquil. We stayed in one other neighborhood and visited several others (we were scoping out Seattle area) -- West Seattle was by far our favorite. Not too far of a drive (I recommend Uber or Lyft) from Eliza's to Alki Beach where you can rent bikes and enjoy your afternoon on the beach. And not too far of a drive from downtown West Seattle where you'll find a bunch of cute shops and restaurants, as well as a farmer's market on Sundays. "
445199,20174375,2014-09-24,13940576,Cristina,"Eliza is an excellent host, and i had a very pleasant stay in the blue room. I stayed for 2 nights. The place is well connected to downtown, I used to bus to move around and connections are good.  I loved the coffee place nearby.  The house is very nicely decorated, homely and peaceful. I'd stay with Eliza again when in Seattle"
445199,20350262,2014-09-28,3599181,Richard,Eliza was a great host.  Very comfortable home and beds.  I felt safe in the neighborhood and quite.  Awesome espresso coffee joint a few minutes walk away.  Quick access to freeway and downtown.  Free street parking.
445199,20478927,2014-09-29,6827042,David,"Eliza could not have been a more welcoming, kind and hospitable host. Between great recommendations taking time out of her schedule for me on a clearly busy afternoon, she is truly the model of the perfect host. Many thanks. "
445199,20661766,2014-10-03,3710391,Teona,"We loved staying in the Blue Room  - a very restful and friendly place, simply decorated in the nicest way. We only stayed one short night, but the area seemed to offer all we needed. It was a great start to our long drive south and hope we can stay again one day.  There was lots of useful local information in the room, and local maps on the wall.   I will always think of Eliza when an octopus is mentioned!"
445199,20704305,2014-10-04,3144588,Robin,"Eliza was a great host. Unfortunately we only had a few minutes to talk because we had to catch a flight early next morning. The apartment and the room are perfect, everything exceeded our expectations. I can highly recommend it!"
445199,20799134,2014-10-05,11146599,Alysse,"Eliza could not have been more friendly to my friend and I visiting for an overnight in Seattle. She visited with us in person upon our arrival and gave us about a dozen recommendations of places to visit during our stay.

Her home is clean and lovely - accurate to the listing. The neighborhood is a 5 minute car ride to Alki Beach and a less than 10 minute ride to downtown by bus. We would definitely stay here again!"
445199,20908989,2014-10-07,7059460,Annalisa,Eliza's home is warm and inviting. The atmosphere is peaceful. We would recommend to anyone visiting and would certainly return ourselves when back in seattle! 
445199,21042886,2014-10-10,3534636,Jamie,"The Blue Room was exactly what my friend and I were looking for in a place to stay for our last night in Seattle. Close to downtown, the airport, and within walking distance to several nice cafes the location is great. The beds were comfy and the host (Eliza) was extremely helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It was a little difficult to find parking when we stayed but I think that was due to some construction currently going on nearby and we only had to go a couple blocks up to find a spot. Overall it was a great experience and I especially loved the octopus I shared a bed with! :)"
445199,21357080,2014-10-15,21939979,Jamie,"Everything was wonderful at eliza's! Her home is adorable and very comfy. We couldn't have stayed at a better place in seattle! The bus stop to downtown was at most a one minute walk away, which was of course, very convenient. I would absolutely recommend staying with Eliza for anyone looking to stay in Seattle. "
445199,21839987,2014-10-25,11517158,Jessica,"Even after we had gotten back from our trip to Seattle, we are still talking about how much fun our host, Eliza, is. The house was decorated adorably and there were clementines, oatmeal, and fruit leather on the table for us everyday. She also gave us access to essential toiletries. Eliza was the perfect host to hang out with and made it seem more like we were staying with a friend rather than a stranger. "
445199,21921636,2014-10-26,10587454,Sonja,Lovely host and lovely place. We would love to come back! 
445199,22084684,2014-10-29,875712,Patricia,"Excellent host! Eliza is an admirable and inspiring woman. Beautiful house, comfortable and tidy. Clean room, great beds. Our stay was nothing short of perfect, and Eliza was friendly and accommodating. Thanks so much! By the way, cutest bathroom award! And the banana muffins, yum. "
445199,22111075,2014-10-30,2019875,Pei,"Eliza's place is great! Super easy to get to downtown with a bus stop right up the block. She waited until we arrived and settled in a bit before leaving for some gym time. Made sure we had everything we needed and more. It felt very much like home. She was gracious enough to let us keep our luggage there until our red eye flight. Great hostess, great place. Thanks Eliza!"
445199,22493714,2014-11-08,22291039,Diana,"Es war sehr schön bei Eliza. Sie war eine ausgezeichnete Gastgeberin. Ich Haus war schön und sauber. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, es gab aber auch Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe. Mit dem Bus war man sehr schnell in der Innenstadt."
445199,22566495,2014-11-09,14564585,Nigar,"We only stayed a night but we enjoyed our stay at Eliza's place :) We felt at home :) It was definitely a pleasure meeting Eliza & hope to stay with her in near future again :) Thank you so much for everything & special thanks for her staying on the phone with me & giving the greatest direction after being lost for an hour, very appreciated :)))))"
445199,22723676,2014-11-12,19069500,Daniel,Really great host very accommodating. Nice treats and breakfast for the morning. Beautiful house. Really charming place and extremely comfortable. Eliza is wonderful!!
445199,23815265,2014-12-11,19387319,Serge,"I do not always leave a review after an Airbnb visit but this time I feel I should because my experience was exceptional.
Her house is in the right spot in West Seattle, a wooden cozy structure build on a hill. The bus to the center is just in front and takes only 3 stops . I had wonderfull Long runs a long the bay with a view of the city. Eliza was out a lot but gave me all the necessarry information in order for me to navigate to Seattle. She even made eggs and toast for me on Sunday. I recommend her place highly. Greetings . S.van Bemmel/amsterdam/Holland"
445199,25501560,2015-01-18,13228593,Ximena,"I stayed with two of my friends at Eliza's place and it was a wonderful experience. She waited for us until we arrived from the airport and was very welcoming and lovely. She gave us a spare key for us to get in and out at any time, a little tour of the place and extra tourist information. 
The room was really neat, comfortable and quiet. The location is perfect, we just had to take one bus and we were in downtown. She also had options for us to have breakfast and snacks. It was the perfect place to stay in our weekend trip. 
Eliza is really a great host and we would be more than happy to stay with her again. It was a lovely stay."
445199,25625321,2015-01-20,26323518,Jonah,"Place was easy to find, very neat and welcoming atmosphere.  Only was there for a handful of hours, but all in all it was a nice stay.  Excellent shower.  5/5 would recommend/stay again."
445199,25907061,2015-01-29,25676604,Bobby,"Eliza was great! She really made our first AirBnb a memorable one. The Blue room was very charming with its decor that encapsulate Washington's outdoors, coast and thrill for adventure. 

We didn't see her much since she was working on her PhD but every time we spoke to her, my friends and I would have a great conversation with Eliza. She has the cutest little house in such an underrated spot in Seattle. It was so easy to get around and she was very nice in making sure we were ok during the cold Seattle winter. 

West Seattle is a quite area, but it's close enough to downtown with ease. The bus stop into downtown- with a convenient coffee shop and deli near her home- make the Blue Room a must for travellers on a budget. "
445199,26021333,2015-02-01,24131072,Adam,"Staying at Eliza's was a great experience. The blue room is exactly as described; very clean, quiet and comfortable room. Eliza even had toiletries and extra towels ready for our arrival, which was a very nice touch and made us feel home.

Although she wasn't around for the duration of our stay, Eliza made sure that we had everything we need for our stay (couldn't find the gluten-free bread though ;)

Eliza is very friendly and warm. She came by the first day -with the brightest large smile- to say hello and welcome us. We had a great conversation about everything from both our backgrounds, to life philosophy and everything in between!

We appreciated that, Eliza, and hope to be able to visit again sometime soon. Thanks for hosting us! :)"
445199,26627122,2015-02-16,26805432,Amy,"Eliza has been a great host! My friend and I had two great nights there. The blue room is even more cute than it is on the photo! WE loved it! And it is very convenient to travel around. 
It is so great to know Eliza! We would definitely visit again when we go to Seattle!"
445199,26852105,2015-02-20,1147826,Victoria,"Warm and cozy, Eliza's place had everything we needed. Eliza is a great host who went out of her way to make sure we were well cared for. The Blue Room is really comfortable and clean, the house is light and airy and the location is super convenient to downtown. I would highly recommend it. Thanks Eliza for making us feel at home!"
445199,27100576,2015-02-25,18549252,Jessie,Eliza was so kind and awesome! We felt so comfy and like we were staying with friends. 
445199,27165322,2015-02-27,1849707,Angela,"Eliza was welcoming, warm, friendly and lovely! We really enjoyed staying at her house, it was comfortable, convenient and peaceful. We also liked the board games drawer :) Thanks Eliza !"

We got a nice burger and rock concert in our first night just across the street!!! Perfect after a long day driving:) highly recommend! :) was a great experience! 
445199,27892198,2015-03-14,22801691,Anneke,"Eliza was a great host and gave us a lovely experience in Seattle. Originally we only planned on spending one night but thanks to her being so spontaneous she agreed on arriving earlier. The blue room is, just like the rest of the house, very clean, comfortable and just a pleasure to stay in. The location of her house is also great - it didn't even take us 10 minutes to get to downtown by bus! Eliza was a very helpful and kind host and I can highly recommend staying with her! Thank you for everything!"
445199,28163781,2015-03-19,686702,Megan,Eliza was as awesome as her home. The accommodations were very comfortable and clean. Her house was adorable and in a cute and quiet neighborhood. I am so happy we chose her place to stay in Seattle!
445199,28730507,2015-03-29,3599181,Richard,This is my 2nd time staying with Eliza.  My experience was as good as the first.  Great place and close to DT without all the parking hassle.  
445199,30822272,2015-04-27,31251686,Jessica,"My friends and I were on a roadtrip through the Pacific Northwest and loved staying with Eliza on our stop in Seattle. Street parking was simple (and free!), and the location was a convenient distance from the city via car or bus. We felt like serene, happy jellyfish in the blue room, which was thoughtfully stocked with travel necessities like mini toiletries and phone chargers as well as Washington themed travel books.

Eliza was a delightful hostess, making us feel very welcome and giving us recommendations on what to do in the area.  Would totally love to stay here again in the future!"
445199,30905899,2015-04-28,11897755,Tovah,Eliza and her Blue Room are great! The location is perfect and the room was very cozy. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay. 
445199,31257947,2015-05-03,10953171,Paloma,"Eliza is an excellent host! She has a beautiful house and she is able to make anyone feel at home. Her place is spotless and beautifully decorated, meticulously kept, and books on Seattle are readily available. Her house is a 5-10 minute drive to downtown, where the famous Pike Market is located. Eliza is a perfect go-to person, she gave me tips on where to have a fun and interesting experiences in Sea-town while avoiding the crowds. I couldn't have asked for a better stay in the Emerald city. I would come back here any day; thank you Eliza for making my first AirBNB a memorable one."
445199,31838639,2015-05-10,9464208,LeeAnna,"The description of the room matched the real thing very well. Eliza's personal touch made the stay special. She left fruit and breakfast items for us with a newspaper and a note. She is very well organized and keeps the house clean and neat. There were no problems, the neighbourhood was comfortable and it was just a quick bus ride or cab ride into town. I would happily stay there again. "
445199,32128052,2015-05-14,5471696,Pia,It's been great!
445199,32542876,2015-05-19,5315666,Angela,"Staying in Eliza's blue room was all worth it. In our short stay, my younger brother and I felt secured and comfortable. Eliza made sure we had everything we need - from free oatmeal packets and fruits to making us use her kitchen when we wanted to cook dinner.  The room was clean and the sheets were fresh smelling. Sleeping at night felt like I was home. 

Eliza's a congenial and accommodating host, answered my queries and was a pleasant person to converse with. Will surely come back to her home when we visit Seattle!"
445199,32702080,2015-05-20,31643343,Katrin,"It was oure first experience with Airbnb an it was Great :) the bloo Room is a good Place to stay if you Want to explore seattle. Thanks to Eliza, who is a great host. "
445199,32990464,2015-05-24,30616949,Qin Rui,"Overall we had a great experience staying over at Eliza's Blue Room. It is clean and cozy and everything is as described in the listing. The location is really convenient for us to travel to the downtown ( 5 to 10 minutes of bus ride ). It feels like staying in our own house for the past  3 nights at the Blue Room, definitely a thumbs up!"
445199,33509615,2015-05-29,9297173,Qiong,"Her room is very clean, quiet, beautiful, sweet, the surrounding traffic is very convenient, I live here is a great experience.
She is very friendly and timely help for our problem, here must continue to stay here again next time!"
445199,33685043,2015-05-31,31628959,Pingping,"I had a very nice stay in her house. It was clean, tidy, and convenient to get around. I loved Alki trail which runs all the way to Alki beach. Eliza was on a vacation when I arrived, but she left me a card which explained where things were and offered coffee and tea. That was very thoughtful. She was also very flexible with checking in and out time. Overall, i would recommend it if you are looking at it. "
445199,34029486,2015-06-03,13077425,Nic,"What a great host, even though Eliza was away, we were perfectly taken care of. A lovely house that was in a good location for parking, a few local spots to check out and convenient for access to downtown (we were driving). Would definitely like to stay here again when visiting Seattle in the future."
445199,34193162,2015-06-06,28341163,Helen,Great location ....Cosy and clean
445199,34982695,2015-06-14,33452622,Joe,The Blue room was a very nice clean room in a craftsman style home. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi worked great. Eliza was a great host and we enjoyed our conversations over coffee. The location was easy to find. Parking was on the street and not available in front of the house each time we required it but it seemed a quiet street so we were not concerned. The home is located on a hill and this required us to carry our luggage up some stairs to enter the house. We would stay in The Blue Room again.
445199,35230384,2015-06-16,33241900,Sheri,"Eliza was a wonderful, welcoming hostess. The room was exactly as pictured and the beds were very comfortable. I wanted to avoid renting and driving a car in an unfamiliar area and access to downtown Seattle by public transit was easy with the bus stop only 1 block away. I would recommend the Blue Room!"
445199,35482087,2015-06-19,26567768,Wanxuan,"Eliza is a nice host, she is considerate. The location is good, there is a bus station near the house can take us to downtown. Room is clean and nice which makes us feel like home."
445199,36406284,2015-06-28,33776282,Laney,"We loved staying in the Blue Room! Eliza made us feel very welcome and she offered great transportation, restaurant and site-seeing recommendations. Eliza invited us to various activities which immediately made us feel comfortable in a completely new city. We also loved being able to walk/hike to Alki Beach from her place and enjoy the kayaking - definitely a must-do! 

Our trip would not have been as enjoyable without having Eliza to guide us and the blue room to stay in. We would definitely come back again!"
445199,37526266,2015-07-07,4254386,Jonathan,Eliza was a great host -- very friendly and laid-back. She even taught me some cool stuff about the local submarine ecosystem. The room was quiet and cozy. Highly recommended.
445199,37912099,2015-07-11,37261392,Chloe,It was a great first experience! Eliza was great!
445199,38414891,2015-07-15,35643343,Kate,"Our stay with Eliza was wonderful.  The house is tiny but very comfotable.  Eliza gave us plenty of personal space while being welcoming, friendly and very helpful with information and directions.  My 17 year old grandson gave her two thumbs up."
445199,38688356,2015-07-18,8450225,Leverbe,"La maison d'Eliza est située à l'ouest du centre ville, que l'on rejoint très facilement en 10mn par les bus 120 ou 125. L'arrêt est au croisement Andover/Delridge, à 3 mn de la maison. Maison et chambre très agréables, avec le sentiment de vrai partage qui devrait toujours être la marque d'Airbnb. Eliza a été une hôte charmante. Seattle est très différent d'autres grandes villes américaines, la présence de l'eau, partout, y étant pour beaucoup. L'Universté de Washington, sur les hauteurs vaut vraiment le détour d'une visite. Mais admirer la ville depuis Kerry Park au crépuscule fait partie de nos ""great moments"" aux États-Unis. Encore merci à Eliza !!"
445199,40228477,2015-07-29,27776905,Mark,"Eliza was welcoming, helpful and very accommodating. She communicated well prior to arrival. Thoughtfull touches such as oatmeal, spare toiletries made for a great stay. The set up was perfect for a family of three and the house had a nice little retro vibe. The location was incredibly close to the bus stop so we could get down town quickly and easily walk from the bus stop to places such as pike place market. Eliza place contributed to having a fab time in seattle"
445199,42111029,2015-08-11,25849495,Luke,"Staying at The Blue Room was fantastic, the host and the room was everything that could be desired.  The area is a friendly place that has all you need (including a coffee shop / board-game place).

5*s, would recommend to anyone."
445199,42948827,2015-08-16,40385595,Marjorie,"What an amazing first experience of Seattle and Airbnb! I wish I could have spent more time in Seattle- a beautiful city and Eliza's home is perfectly located between hip West Seattle and bustling Downtown. I also would have loved to spend more time with Eliza, who spent a couple hours chatting with me after a long day of work. It was wonderful to feel so welcomed and cared for after a long journey across the country. 
"
445199,49116637,2015-10-01,40857734,Laura,We loved staying in Eliza's lovely home! It was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Eliza was so lovely and helpful. It was a short and simple bus ride to Pike Place Market which was one of our favourite parts of the trip. I'd definitely come back!
445199,49518024,2015-10-04,43819792,Elizabeth,"Had a really great stay at Eliza's house and a very fun time in Seattle.  The house was easily accessible via the bus system (just take a 10 minute bus ride via the 120 or 125 from downtown).  It was nice to be in a spot that was a little ways away from the city to spend some relaxing evenings after the day of sightseeing.  From the fire pit in the back yard to the lovely piano in the living room, we had as much fun at the house as we did traveling around Seattle.  The house is also within walking distance from Uptown Espresso (which has delicious coffee and unique board games) as well as a small grocery/convenience store, which made it an ideal location."
445199,49812319,2015-10-06,35103389,Bryan,Fantastic house. Relaxing. Quaint. Felt welcomed and enjoyed our time here. 
445199,51305164,2015-10-19,6852920,Katrina,We had a really great time at Eliza's home. It is a beautiful place with great decor and some interesting books. Very clean and exactly as described. Thanks for the great stay!
445199,52717450,2015-11-01,38976452,Curtis,The house was beautiful and as advertised.
1159226,11534288,2014-04-07,11770199,Matthew,Such a cute place! Christine was so nice and accessible for any questions my group and I had during our stay. The rooms were comfortable and the apartment was very clean. The location is in the heart of Capitol Hill and there is a 24 hour grocery store across the street! Starbucks is nearby as well. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and could easily walk downtown. The apartment building was quaint and there is an intercom that you can page directly to your room so you can get in when other people in your group are in the apartment. It was a great stay and I would definitely stay again. 
1159226,13322406,2014-05-25,9875976,Aram,"Great place for a family: clean, well-appointed, centrally located. The block is a bit noisy, but the windows have good sound insulation so it wasn't a problem at all. Would definitely stay there again."
1159226,14578470,2014-06-22,2287418,Brian,"If you were ever reticent of using Airbnb to visit Seattle, this place is an excellent reference point. It seems very similar to a 2-bedroom hotel suite, nicely appointed, with a small kitchen. This place is not at all like invading someone's home. And, it is right downtown--about 8 minutes drive to Pike Place--in a really nice little eclectic neighborhood of Seattle.
"
1159226,19331852,2014-09-10,20228391,Terry,"Listing was accurate. Very convenient. Neat, clean, modern amenities. Would use it again next time in Seattle. 
Neighborhood in transition - lots of construction.  A bit noisy, but aircon meant we did not need to leave windows open in August, so no worries."
1159226,20425556,2014-09-29,15061501,Brian,Great apartment in Capitol Hill. Walking distance to tons of great restaurant and bars. Super easy check-in and checkout procedures. Will definitely stay here again and it has my highest recommendation.
1159226,21829932,2014-10-25,1427721,Edward,"St Johns apartments are as described - right in the heart of Capitol hill activity.  It is a very busy area with people talking outside until 4 AM, but it didn't cause me any sleep problems. The bed was very comfortable! The apt was well stocked and organized with lots of room.  Really like an old hotel but more space. It is an old building but everything worked.  The rental people were personable, professional, and accessible-have an office downstairs.  I feel for the price they should include parking which is a hassle unless you pay for the parking pass- but at least there was parking available. Overall a good palce to stay."
1159226,23912691,2014-12-14,22242992,Nathan,"The apartment was great - exactly as expected. Christine made sure to prepare the apartment for our arrival. The apt was in a great location as advertised, central to everything that we wanted to do. Would rent here again if we visited Seattle."
1159226,25271152,2015-01-11,7589762,Jacob,"The host was great, checking in and checking out were easy. The place was very nice, exactly as described. Great location in Capitol Hill."
1159226,32601085,2015-05-19,6083170,Rosy,"We had a great time at St. John's Apartments and would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Seattle.  It was in a perfect location, Capitol Hill is a very fun vibrant neighborhood with lots of great restaurants, bars and people watching.  Downtown, Pike Place market, etc. is only a 15-20 minute walk down Pike street, and a cab ride home from downtown was $8.

Christine was also very easy to communicate with, and I had no problem arranging our check-in etc.

The apartment itself was also great.  The beds were super comfy, and the kitchen has everything you could hope for and more.

Overall, I would highly recommend St. John's Apartments if you are looking for a great place in a really fun neighborhood!  "
1159226,34702421,2015-06-11,441688,Daphné,"Notre appartement était impeccable et charmant. Lorsque nous sommes arrivés, tout était propre, bien rangé, et nous avions suffisamment de serviettes/débarbouillettes/fournitures pour toute la semaine de notre séjour. De plus, l'air climatisé dans les chambres est très efficace. Nous avons profité à quelques reprises de la terrasse commune et du BBQ. L'appartement est très bien situé dans Seattle, dans le quartier de Capitol Hill où se trouve de superbes parcs, librairies, cafés, bars, et où il fait bon vivre. Il était très facile de se rendre au centre-ville et au Pike Place Market à pied. De plus, les hôtes sont très professionnels et disponibles. Merci pour cet accueil et cette superbe expérience!"
1159226,43357987,2015-08-19,32508292,Grégory,"Situe dans un quartier tres vivant le soir (bien mieux que downtown), a dix minutes a pieds du centre-ville et 15 de Pike Market. L'appartement est tres propre, avec tout le confort necessaire (shampoing, savon, serviettes de toilette, etc). Il y a tout ce dont on a besoin dans la cuisine. Un grand magasin est situe juste en face de l'appartement. 
Appartement tres agreable, c'est un plaisir de rentrer a ""la maison"" apres un journee de visite.
Il y a une laverie collective dans l'immeuble (1$ la machine). Le wi-fi marche parfaitement."

1159226,51712217,2015-10-24,4492669,Miguel,"We had a great stay @ St. Johns Apartments. The neighbourhood can be a bit louder during the night but was never a trouble for us. The apartment is very conveniently located, close to Interstate, parking space available, close to the bus stop, and with a gourmet supermarket in front. How much better can it get? The interiour is perfect, clean and you feel at home immediately. I travelled with two 78yo ladies and yes the stairs were part of their daily exercice :-), but they managed with ease. Everything we needed was available in the apartment, Christine is a charming host, the information book contains everthing I could come up with. We had a great time in Seattle and I long to come back soon!"
1159226,54185920,2015-11-16,6299085,Carl,We had a great stay!  The place was in such a good location.  You can walk anywhere from here!  There's also a lot of great dinner and drink places nearby! The apartment was nice and clean with great amenities!  Christine was extremely nice too!  Thanks again!
356566,1041806,2012-03-25,1936096,Willie,I'm in the middle of an extended stay here and would highly recommend it for anyone. Cam is awesome and his house is really cool. Plenty of space so it doesn't feel like you're ever on top of someone else. The neighborhood is really cool and it's got a nice view and good street parking. Two thumbs up!
356566,1104624,2012-04-10,1936096,Willie,I've now stayed at Cam's place for about a month and I can say (again) that it all that and a bag of chips. Highly recommended. 
356566,1146357,2012-04-17,2125871,Tiana,"Cam is a great host. He made me feel very comfortable and right at home. I made a last minute decision to stay in Seattle, sent him an email through airbnb, but wasn't sure if I would hear back from him on-time. I got a response right away. He was very organized, sent me an email with everything I needed to know about the house, the neighborhood, things to do and etc. The house is great and beautifully decorated. The room is awesome,The neighborhood is also amazing. A+ for everything. "
356566,1394927,2012-06-01,2265705,Vivian,"I had recently moved back to Seattle and needed a place to re-orient myself with the city and get organized. Cam's home was the perfect place to do that. I felt at home because it was nestled in the Wallingford neighborhood's residential area, but appreciated the convenience it offered with its central location. Staying at Cam's help me reconnect with everything I love about Seattle: Good people, good walks and easy access to great food and (of course) coffee. Cam is also very friendly and easy-going."
356566,1578584,2012-06-27,1312593,Michael,"This house is incredibly warm and inviting, and Wallingford is a great Seattle neighborhood.  Cam is an awesome host.  I would highly recommend a stay here."
356566,2205866,2012-09-05,89002,Anne,"After a really long and exhausting flight, Seattle and Cam's house were our first stay. And we were absolutely happy that exactly here were our first place because it was so easy with Cam and we feel right like at home. Cam provided us an additional bed without any charge and it was already stet-up as we arrived. The house itself is very lovely on a quite district. All rooms are very clean and tastefully arranged. The kitchen war very good equipped and we could use everything. It was easy to park with our car and easy to move in all directions. Cam invitet us to stay together with parts of his familiy and some neigbours to have a little branch. This was a perfect moment to get in touch with many people. Cam didn't have any problems with our little daughter and had big intuition. He answers on any questions and gave needful recommandations so we would absolutely recommend to stay here when being in Seattle! Looking forward to see you again, Cam!"
356566,2471958,2012-10-01,3484846,Willie,"My stay at Cam's house was perfect. The room and the home we spacious and beautiful. The location was unbeatable with views of the Seattle skyline. Cam was a great host. Super nice, really cool guy. I also became best friends with his incredibly sweet dog Stella. If you are looking for a great, classic, Seattle home, this would be the place."
356566,2784466,2012-11-02,3449626,Robert,"I stayed in Seattle for a month at Cam's place and I don't think I could have found a better place to stay.  Cam is a super welcoming person and I immediately felt at home.  The house is very comfortable and in a great location in the Walingford neighborhood with easy access to University of Washington campus and medical center.  Everything you need is nearby and it is very easy to get to pretty much any interesting part of Seattle.  Additionally, you have access to a full kitchen, refrigerator space, and a laundry machine and dryer which is all really useful if you are in Seattle for an extended stay. 
Cam has a dog, but she is very sweet and warms up to visitors quickly.  For me the dog was no problem at all.  
I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Cam's again and if any of my friends travel to Seattle in the future, I would absolutely recommend this as a great place to stay.
Cam is a very friendly, honest person and a great host. If you are planning on staying in Seattle for a while, especially if you need to be near the University district, I highly recommend staying here."
356566,3463218,2013-02-03,3016023,Candace,"Gorgeous, gorgeous place. This man has impeccable taste. I stayed at Cam's for 5 weeks when I first arrived in Seattle. He was super easygoing and put me at ease, sometimes difficult when you're in a new country. It wasn't hard to make his home in Wallingford feel like home. Lots of space in the living room to hang out when you want and the bathroom was very clean (always important to me). There are even speakers in the kitchen and the back porch that you can use to stream your music over. There was also room in the garage to keep my newly purchased bicycle. Happiness. Great stay."
356566,3889008,2013-03-25,5008872,Beth,"comfortable, easy and relaxing.  Perfect location for our needs!"
356566,4183826,2013-04-16,653785,Debra,"I reserved the sunny bedroom at Cam’s place for a new team member who was in Seattle for two weeks of intense training because I wanted her to have a comfortable place to relax at the end of a long day. The woman I booked for could not have been happier and was thrilled to be able to come home from work and unwind in comfort. I visited her one evening and was so impressed with how beautiful and comfortable everything was. Not to mention spotlessly clean! Having access to Cam’s wonderful kitchen was a huge bonus as well. 
I highly recommend booking one of Cam’s rooms for anyone coming to Seattle. He’s a great host, the neighborhood is wonderful and close to everything. I’ll definitely book with here again. Thanks, Cam!
"
356566,8517077,2013-11-04,7626732,Rachel,"Cam was a perfect host! I spent five weeks in Seattle and was really happy to be in such a nice place. He always had nice tips about what to do around and in Seattle. He has a really nice dog (Stella) and she is also great. The kitchen is big and nice and I used it almost every day. The living room is also great and cozy. I was really happy to have the room with the balcony, which offers a great view of the Seattle skyline. I hope to come back to Seattle again and I would really like to stay at Cam´s place again!"
356566,10508405,2014-02-23,8604537,Thomas,"I stayed at Cam's place for five weeks while visiting Seattle for work. Cam is really easy-going, friendly and welcoming, and he made me feel at home straightaway. He was always able to suggest things to do and see. You couldn't ask for a better host. Cam was kind enough to introduce me to 'American' football, just in time for the Superbowl final - what a time to be in Seattle!

Cam's house is fantastic. Honestly, I could not have been happier with my choice to stay here. I knew I was going to enjoy my stay as soon as I stepped out of the taxi! Comfortable, stylish (the pictures really can't hope to do it justice!), spotlessly clean, well-equipped (I wish I had Cam's kitchen back in the UK), and overall a great place to relax and make your Seattle 'home'. 

I was working at the University of Washington, and the location couldn't have been better - just a short walk along the waterfront, with views of downtown Seattle. There's plenty to see in Wallingford, but it's quiet and safe. It also has a 24hr supermarket. Fremont is also just a short walk away, with great coffee (of course). Plus, good bus services to downtown make this the ideal location.

I'd definitely stay again, to hang out with Stella (Cam's ace dog) if nothing else! Highly, highly, highly recommended.

Thanks again, Cam."
1539476,6973068,2013-09-01,318952,Edwin,Super clean apartment and Nina was an extra friendly host. Her check-in process is really inviting and informational. Would stay again!
1539476,7047241,2013-09-04,6522599,Laura,"Nina was considerate, gracious and very accommodating. Her place was very clean and cozy, outfitted with everything a traveler could need-- comfortable bed, quality bedding and towels, spare toiletries if you have forgotten any, lots of storage space in bedroom. I loved the location as well. Bustling and hip, close to downtown and amenities. I felt at home and well taken care of. I would also recommend her to anyone."
1539476,7233125,2013-09-11,8676811,Martijn,"Nina's place is in a great location near Seattle downtown (about 20 min walk to Pike Place Market). Her place is comfortable, with a very good bed, shower and internet. Most of all she is a very nice host, considerate of her guest needs and interested in background and stories. I enjoyed staying very much, loved the neighborhood of Capitol Hill with all non-standard coffee places, shops and ambiance. Would stay again any time."
1539476,7572034,2013-09-24,8157278,John,"This was my second airbnb experience and Nina helped make it a great one. She was very nice and accommodating. Her place is in a great location walking distance to many restaurants, bars, shops, and downtown. Her place itself was very clean and had everything I needed for my 3 night stay. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
1539476,7704753,2013-09-30,3354856,Liz,"Nina's apartment was absolutely perfect for my stay in Seattle.  The location in Capitol Hill was extremely convenient, great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops just down the street.  I was there for a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and was able to walk there every morning, about a 15 minute walk.  The apartment itself was also amazing.  Clean, spacious room with a desk and traveler amenities, spotless bathroom, working kitchen, and comfortable living area. I cannot express enough how great it was to stay with Nina, I would recommend it to any and everyone!"
1539476,7931385,2013-10-08,8675047,Rachel,"There is not one thing I would have changed about my stay with Nina-- everything was absolutely perfect. Her place was a lovely, quiet refuge while I scampered all over Seattle seeing old friends. The room was clean and neat and peaceful, and the sheets were ridiculously soft. I'm not usually much of an animal person but was totally charmed by her little dog, who was quiet and polite and friendly. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
1539476,8156829,2013-10-18,9145468,Gaurav,"Superclean apartment, good bedding, spare toiletries, easy checkin process, 15 minute walk to everything going on in Seattle- why would anyone pay double for a hotel, when you could feel at home away from home? Hardly saw Nina as our schedules were different, but met her on the last day. She's a pleasant and friendly host. Highly recommended!"
1539476,10138875,2014-02-02,2520325,Nina,I loved staying with Nina! She was so friendly and made me feel very comfortable during my visit. Her place was clean and located near downtown. I highly recommend her as a host. 
1539476,10544278,2014-02-24,10782546,Vadim,"Nina is a very nice person and staying at her place was really pleasant. Her appartment was clean and well located. I'd recommand it again and again! 
Btw thanks again for the ride here and there, that was so nice of you!"
1539476,10677944,2014-03-03,4982899,Pattabi,"Nina was a great host.  I came in very late the first night and she stayed up to greet me with her cute little chihuahua.  Her place was very comfortable and centrally located, and I appreciated the fact that she provided cereal and fruit for breakfast.  "
1539476,12350060,2014-04-29,13989977,Mah,"This is a great space. Nina offers clean, beautiful apartment with a great view. Great people at the apartment as well. They will make sure you are well and they are local people who can tell you where to go. Love the space. "
1539476,14094349,2014-06-11,10192891,Sang-Youp,"I enjoyed the neighborhood first of all. There were lots of good restaurants and cafes. 

The place was very clean. Nina prepared towels and some other essentials in case people forgot to bring theirs. She also prepared simple breakfast stuff in her kitchen that I can eat. And that makes my day start easier. 

I like to go back to Nina's if I visit Seattle again. "
1539476,14867812,2014-06-28,9039125,Leslie,"Nina was a fantastic host. Her apartment was very clean and close to downtown. Nina was very friendly and helpful-- also, her dog was adorable. She set aside products in case I forgot some and even offered breakfast (which I didn't have time to try). I would definitely stay here again. "
1539476,15502081,2014-07-10,16667469,Eric,"I wish I could know Nina and her friends more. I love Seattle, and enjoyed staying at Nina's. Everything is good, clean n quiet place and close to downtown. The only thing I was unhappy with was that I had to leave Seattle after a 5 days visit. Thanks, Nina."
1539476,15783653,2014-07-15,11047741,Mike,The location of the apartment was excellent and was perfect for a three night stay. The room and bathroom were both very clean. It is close to bus stops and in a real cool area near downtown. I did not have a vehicle and got around easily. I found a nearby breakfast restaurant and liquor store convenient. Nina is a great host and very helpful with local information. I would highly recommend staying at Nina’s. 
1539476,16927830,2014-08-04,18166492,Michelle,"
Nina is a very nice person, and an excellent host!!  The location is perfect to get around. I didn't have to get a rental car. Everything is walking distance and has very easy access to public transportation. Her place is beautiful, very clean and cozy. Staying at Nina's place was an excellent decision! I highly recommend Nina's place. I would definitely love to stay there on my next visit to Seattle! ;)"
1539476,17170763,2014-08-08,18361347,Christina,"Nina was a great host - very responsive and accommodated my check-in/out times. She provided breakfast, coffee, toiletries, maps/guides and an Orca transit card. The Orca card was especially helpful since I don't often carry change and Seattle has some killer hills. The location of the apartment was great - about a 20 min walk to ""downtown,"" but within a block or two of Capitol Hill restaurants and stores. Ideal for someone looking for a place that is close to attractions, but without the noise. "
1539476,17387502,2014-08-11,16970991,Christopher,"Nina was a great host.  Even though my flight was delayed and I didn't get to her apartment until 2AM, she still answered the door immediately and took time to show me around and talk.  She also had amenities, coffee, and cereal ready also.  

The room was spacious and clean with a comfortable bed and desk.  The apartment is also located a minutes walk from the bus station that will take you to Downtown Seattle or the typical sights such as the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  There were a lot of nice restaurants and interesting stores right in Capitol Hill where her apartment is located as well.  I would definitely recommend staying at Nina's when visiting Seattle."
1539476,18338013,2014-08-25,149191,Alisa,"Staying with Nina was great! Her apartment was very clean and confortable. She also offered basic toiletries and breakfast which was very convenient. The location is unbeatable: 15 min walk to downtown and only a couple blocks from the shops, restaurants and bars."
1539476,18587295,2014-08-28,19925783,Mark,"Nina was a great host!  She was very prompt to respond at initial contact in setting up a potential stay.  She made herself readily available the evening I arrived to make sure I found her place ok.  She gave plenty of suggestions of what to do around town during my stay which was helpful.  With AirBNB my concerns were is the location actually where I wanted, and is it safe/clean.  Her place is in a great location for what I was looking for.  The immediate neighborhood  has plenty to do if you want to stay close for food/drinks, and then you are a short $10 cab or a 20 minute walk (guesstimates) to downtown or the Public Market Place.  We could come and go as we pleased, and didn't have to worry about being loud or late etc.  The place was very clean and worked perfectly for my stay.  I would highly recommend Nina's place, and if I go back to Seattle she would get another call."
1539476,18885622,2014-09-02,17992805,Mitch,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and it has definitely made me want to use it more. Nina was super cool and easy to make arrangements with, the place was exactly what I needed for the long weekend, and it was like half the price of getting a hotel in the same part of town."
1539476,19692958,2014-09-16,17322585,Shu Hui,"Nina's place is amazing! Its clean,  neat and at a great location. It is a quick 15mins walk to downtown and there are also restaurants, bars, grocery stores a few blocks away. Nina is a very respectful host and she made my stay at her home very comfortable. Thanks for hosting me! "
1539476,20921277,2014-10-07,4273998,Jonathan,"Nina was super accommodating and provided more than necessary to enjoy my stay. The apartment is in such a great location, about 3 blocks to Broadway and if you're trying to save money it's about a 15 minute walk to downtown."
1539476,22840321,2014-11-16,7866960,Ugo,Nina is a great host and the place is fantastic. The house is very close to downtown and in just few minutes you have lot of pubs and shops.
1539476,23046893,2014-11-21,14415982,Nalditya,"Nina was very welcoming.  She's  an amazing host, flexible in my arriving time, and responded to my text questions quick.  The room and bathroom was clean, and there's also heater to warm you up during cold nights. Laundry detergent, umbrella, toiletries are provided along with welcome fruits and candy! The location's super; close to broadway and downtown, and starbucks is just right next block. You can walk everywhere and stores open late.  Chewy the chihuahua was adorable and liked to snuggle if you allow it.  Recommended if you're travelling to Seattle. "
1539476,28994556,2015-04-02,16088058,Tom,"Nina was a great host, very generous but also respectful of my space. Her Capitol Hill apartment is excellently located near both downtown and trendier parts of town, and her living room affords a splendid view of the Space Needle as well. When I arrived, she had breakfast supplies at the ready, and the room came stocked with travel guides, spare power cables, and extra toiletries. A very pleasant experience overall!"
1539476,29509363,2015-04-08,7476255,Andre,"Nina met me personally when I arrived and made me feel welcome. The room and situation completely met my expectations from the listing description. Additionally, I liked the neighborhood and there was a pleasant local coffee shop and convenience store a short distance from the building. I was struggling with a cold when I arrived in Seattle and ended up spending more time in the room than I had planned, trying to rest and recoup my energy. Nina's place was quiet during day and evening and allowed me to do this. If I had any concern, it was easy to contact Nina."
1539476,30868912,2015-04-28,28687920,Martina,"Nina was a great host. She was super respectful and accommodating. The room was clean, tidy and supplied with all things you might have forgotten during your journey, including toiletry, breakfast and books/magazines/maps with local information. The apartment is in a quiet area, but still in walking distance to everything you need like shops, clubs, restaurants, bars, public transport, etc. Nina was really helpful and I enjoyed the long discussions with her and Bill. I had a really good time in Seattle thanks to both of them. When I am going to visit Seattle again, she definitely gets my call. "
1539476,32996405,2015-05-24,31097315,Sam,"Nina was a wonderful host. The entire space was very clean and organized, with a great view of the Space Needle from the living room.   The bedroom was spacious, comfy bed, and quiet. The clean towels and toiletries like travel shampoo were a nice touch. Location is of course great in the center of Capitol Hill right next to a Starbucks. I was familiar to Seattle, but if I hadn't been, Nina had many resources and suggestions readily available. My favorite part was getting to meet her dog, who stayed quiet during the entirety of my stay but was very friendly and open to hanging out."
1539476,34950794,2015-06-14,29936488,朱,Nina 是个热情的房东，在我居住期间给我提供了各种生活用品，偶尔还会提供水果。房间很干净，客厅可以直接看到太空针，位置也很便利。美中不足的是公寓楼内养狗的比较多，楼梯间的味道比较难闻。
1539476,35487452,2015-06-19,34306100,Elise,"Nina was a great host - welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable about Seattle, flexible with schedules. Her apartment is in a wonderful location - easy walk, bus ride or uber to downtown and other destinations and lots of food and shops nearby. The room was clean and comfortable. My stay was nice and easy and a great value."
1539476,35950070,2015-06-23,34476382,Tilman,"Nina is a very friendly host. The place is clean, the bars and clubs on Pike and Pine are in walking distance, you have everything you need and if you're a smoker you can even smoke on the balcony. I had a great time in Seattle and would choose to stay with Nina again."
1539476,37387976,2015-07-06,11560133,Jacqui,"I loved my stay with Nina!
Her apartment is in Capitol Hill, which is only a 10-15 minute walk into downtown. The area itself is great, filled with heaps of cafes, restaurants and shops....I always felt safe walking around and time of the day.
The room in her apartment is very big with a comfortable bed, and I always felt welcome everywhere else too.
I would highly recommend staying here, Nina (and her dog) are very nice and welcoming, you won't be disappointed!"
1539476,38504886,2015-07-16,5483040,James,"Nina was there to greet me when I arrived and had a pile of maps, leaflets and a couple of books on Seattle. The room is a good size, it was spotlessly clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The location - Capitol Hill - is excellent, it is trendy, has some nice, friendly bars selling craft beers and a good selection of inexpensive restaurants. It's a short walk to downtown or up the hill to the trendy Pike'n'Pine area."
1539476,39298116,2015-07-22,21052081,Nick,"I rented this AirBnB for my mom to stay at while she was visiting from out-of-state. It was a great and convenient location. Accommodations were good: private room, shared bathroom. Nina had towels, travel guides, a fan (it was really hot that week). Overall it was good; however, there was one major detractor that can't be overlooked. My mom checked in on a Thursday and Friday night my mom came back late, the lights were off and a guy was sitting at the kitchen table. It really scared my mom. Nina never told her about anyone else being there. It left my mom feeling pretty uncomfortable during the weekend to have someone (a male) staying there that she had no idea who he was or why he was there (though later he explained he was ""watching the place for Nina while she was away for the weekend""). A little heads up would have really been appreciated. No female appreciates walking into a strange new place (that isn't even a real hotel) and having a man sitting in the dark at a table. It really creeped her out and left her feeling pretty uncomfortable for the first couple of days. "
1539476,39820458,2015-07-26,37708435,Kevin,"Had a really good visit with Nina.  My room was great and Nina gave me the full tour when I arrived.  The area was nice too, conveniently located, felt very centralized.  Nina was also very helpful with questions I had about the city.  Thanks Nina!"
1539476,40323671,2015-07-30,32658257,Atsushi,"Thanks to Nina, I really enjoyed my first visit to Seattle. She made my stay in Seattle feel like home. The room is clean, large, quiet, and comfortable. The apartment is in a central location, walking distance to downtown, and I could use uber or lyft to anywhere. A lot of restaurants, bars, shops are nearby. Arigato!"
1539476,42518559,2015-08-14,32673032,Florian,Excellent - Nina is a great host. The apartment is clean. Room has good size. Bed is comfortable. Good location in walking distance of Downtown and Capitol Hill. Great view from the living room.
1539476,43767179,2015-08-22,21716822,Hagen,"The Capital Hill location is great and my host has a enviable view of the Space Needle from her living room window. The Space Needle is an oddly appealing retro icon. I remember going to the Seattle World's Fair as a child. For reasons I'll never understand, I REALLY remember the white arches, but I was of an impressionable age.

My accommodations were simple but spacious & comfortable. It was unusually warm in Seattle, but the window provided plenty of ventilation. 

Nina was a great host, friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this offering if you're travelling to Seattle and want to get off the beaten path and experience  one of Seattle's most iconic neighborhoods."
1539476,44445399,2015-08-26,38968571,Donatha,Nina was an amazing host! Very friendly and welcoming. The room was perfect for my stay. Nina was also very willing to offer and help me with anything I needed. Would love to stay again during future visits to Seattle!
1539476,45367977,2015-09-02,32910820,Oscar,"Had a great time on my stay at Nina's place. It was my first time using Airbnb. Very flexible on my arrival time, she met up with me downtown to give me the keys to the place and some notes on how to get there. Room is plenty big, bed is nice and firm and had a great time sleeping. The living room has a beautiful view of downtown Seattle and the Space Needle.

There is a very small dog in the apartment, but Chewie never barked or even made a single noise, probably the most laid back chihuahua I've ever seen (I love dogs).

The room is VERY close to downtown, I would say probably about a 15 minute walk downhill. Less than a block away is a very nice Starbucks and SUPER good Breakfast place called GLOW's. Nina recommended it and it was great.
Also I didn't know that Capitol Hill was the perfect area to hang out due to the many bars, coffee shops, and restaurants all over the place. You will not get bored, trust me.

"
1539476,46911343,2015-09-14,40611512,Jean,"I had a warm welcome in Seattle thanks to Nina. Great support also for getting from the airport to the apartment. There's plenty of nice bars around in Capitol Hill and Nina provided me with maps and tips for my stay. Downtown is only 15 min walking away and you can enjoy Seattle all by foot. I had a great time staying and the room was clean and cozy :). Everyday it felt like coming home; would have loved to stay longer.
I can only recommend her!"
1539476,47977840,2015-09-22,38407953,Johnny,"Absolutely amazing experience! This was my first time using Airbnb, and I could not have been happier with this listing. Visiting the place felt like home and not like staying in some arbitrary hotel room. Nina made sure that I had everything I needed to enjoy the full duration of my trip. Highly recommended A++!"
1539476,48728705,2015-09-28,27340547,Kiyomi,"Nina is a very kind and a friendly host. The room was very clean, cozy and comfortable to stay. She prepared a room like a hotel with towels, toothbrush, cotton, etc. The room was also equipped with pens, papers and tourist attraction books which I found very helpful. The neighborhood was safe and you can find a lots of restaurants and cafes in a walking distance, and the every place Nina recommended was so delicious. The place was also a walking distance to the downtown. I would definitely recommend Nina's place to anyone coming to Seattle!"
1539476,49898650,2015-10-07,17264612,Ashley,"Nina was super hospitable and friendly. The room was neat and spacious, and she provided some amenities, which were much appreciated :) 
Location is awesome, in walking distance from everything in a cool neighborhood. Highly recommend!"
1539476,51049449,2015-10-17,8933314,Kealy,"The location of the apartment is awesome. It's close to places on Capital Hill, South Lake Union as well as Downtown. Nina did a nice job of making me feel welcomed and offering various amenities for my stay."
1539476,52340775,2015-10-28,11966217,Phoebe,"Nina was a great hostess! I stayed for five nights at the end of September. Her apartment was cozy and welcoming. Nina also provided some extra chargers and pamphlets of Seattle attractions, a very nice touch. 

She also gave me the heads up her neighbor (I can't remember if they were up or downstairs) tends to play music on the weekend. It only lasted about a half hour-ish on Friday night around 9 PM, nothing I couldn't handle. Nina also provided ear plugs in case it bothered me. 

The location of the building is ideal too, very close to the bus stops, a HUGE Starbucks, and other Capitol Hill attractions/night life/restaurants. Would definitely recommend this Air BNB to anyone traveling solo. "

There was a very thoughtful welcome basket, and Judy came down to make sure I got settled in okay. There were little snacks available as well. I did have to leave early because I have a very sensitive sense of smell and there was not amazing ventilation since it is a basement apartment. If you do have a sensitive sense of smell or issue with allergies or migraines I would be cautious. I wish it had been a problem she could have fixed for me because she was very kind. Because I had to leave early I'm giving my experience two stars, but Judy herself deserves five."

She added nice personal touches to the living space that made it exceptional (a welcome sign, basket of snacks and little treats to enjoy) and even had basic necessities ready for us there incase we forgot our own (toothbrush & paste, lotion etc.).  
The space is as described, comfortable, easy to find and in a great neighborhood. We needed a place to be as we traveled to Seattle to help out some friends and this place was a great haven for us: peaceful, comfortable, a place that felt like a ""home base"" of sorts for our time there.  Judy was sure to want to make the time to meet us and be sure that we were settled in and that we felt like we were welcome to let her know if there was anything else we needed.  The neighborhood is a close walk to so many local bakeries and eateries, easy access to the local zoo and has easy access to I-5.

1802663,8616148,2013-11-08,9670649,Teri,"Ron's place is cute, comfortable and cozy.  He and his wife and tiny dog are delightful and helpful. My arrival was delayed by 6 hours, I was able to text Ron to let him know- he responded quickly assuring me there would be no problem with that. Communication was excellent at every step in the process.   

His place was just two blocks from my daughters apartment in the residential Wallingford area. It is withing walking distance of lots of great restaurants and shops.  I loved the Essential Baking Company and Julia's  for breakfast and lunch and the 4649 Yoroshiku Japanese Restaurant, Art of the Table  and Cantinetta for dinner. I also enjoyed the Sutra Yoga studio which takes walk ins. To top it off the bus stop to downtown are easily accessed.

This  basement apartment is reached along a sweet little garden (email hidden)e fenced in backyard garden with hot tub is well kept and is perfect for hanging out. Ron's place is a  great way to engage the city more like locals than tourists.  Plus Ron and his wife were  very kind and accommodating, I would recommend this space for a couple or an individual. Will look forward to staying there again. Thanks- PS loved the granola and the fruit.  "

I could not have asked for a smoother move to the city thanks to Ron and Cheryl’s kind, friendly, and generous hospitality. The apartment was clean, comfortable and located in a quiet residential area. The location is perfect for commuting to the university, and is within walking distance from a 24-hour grocery store and a variety of restaurants. It was very easy to communicate Ron, he provided a lot of helpful information, and even called a couple of times during my stay to ensure everything was ok. Overall, a wonderful experience. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!"
1802663,10571638,2014-02-25,9670649,Teri,"My second stay at Urban Oasis and it is still cute, comfortable and cozy. The updated bathroom has made the most of a small space. The new shower is a real plus.  Once again he and his wife were delightful and helpful. Communication was excellent at every step in the process.

I am beginning to feel very comfortable in the Wallingford area.This time I was able to make it to the Chocolati Cafe, The Sock Monster store on 45th St. I now have plenty of socks!

Once again I enjoyed the Sutra Yoga studio which takes walk ins. 

I would recommend this apartment space for a couple or an individual who are looking for a great place with access to downtown and the university- but still be in a residential area with lots of nice shops. I look  forward to staying there again. Thanks- PS loved the banana bread!
"
1802663,10705173,2014-03-03,138637,Melody,"Ron was a knowledgable and gracious host. The house was adorable and comfortable, with our every need accounted for, right down to yogurt in the fridge and toothpaste in the bathroom. The hottub was perfect after a long day of sightseeing in the rain. Such a fabulous experience, I would certainly recommend this host to anyone."
1802663,11177354,2014-03-24,2397934,Sam,"Great location, thoughtful hosts. Would stay here again. "
1802663,11406779,2014-04-01,12674440,Sylvia,"We thoroughly enjoyed our whirlwind weekend stay with our Host Ron Waldman,  making sure we were comfortable, provided us with tips where to eat, travel directions. We will definitely come back again, when our other nephew gets married. The apt was clean and bright, hot tub was enjoyable.  Thank you so very much.

1802663,12122894,2014-04-23,6270677,Kathryn,We enjoyed our stay; Ron was a wonderful host.  The location was great--close to  restaurants in Wallingford and Fremont.  Loved the hot tub as well!
1802663,12226706,2014-04-26,9373202,Dan,"We had a lovely stay at Ron's home. As advertised, it is an ""urban oasis"" and it location is perfect for for a stay in Seattle.  The daylight basement one bedroom apartment is comfy and cozy and has everything you need for your stay.  The extra touches like a bottle of vino, granola, banana bread, fresh fruit, coffee and juice were much appreciated. Ron was a very gracious host and worked to make our stay as pleasant as possible.  We would recommend this everyone."
1802663,12625464,2014-05-06,13161938,Lucy,My stay at the Urban Oasis was great.  Ron was an excellent host and very helpful.  Great location for visiting my daughter!  I will definitely stay there again.
1802663,12703558,2014-05-08,9670649,Teri,"Ron and Cheryl will make every effort to ensure your visit to the Wallingford area of Seattle is perfect. They continue to be my go to Air BNB when I travel to Seattle.  I cannot believe how kind and generous they are. I almost don't want anyone else to find out just how  wonderful they are- then where would I stay? 

Seriously, every time I arrive they have added a few more things to make staying with them a treat.  New towels in the bathroom, the new toaster oven, the Reese's peanut butter cups (I tried not to eat them all.) and the well lit walk way.  With summer just around the corner would be a great time to take advantage of the chemical free (salt water) hot tub in their perfectly cozy back yard. Next time for sure!!   Teri Hoover

"
1802663,12865420,2014-05-12,7251578,Josh,"Ron was an excellent host, friendly, informative and accommodating. His house is in a great location, a short walk to both the main Wallingford and Fremont commercial strips. The space was comfortable and clean - we especially enjoyed the complimentary banana bread and Netflix. "
1802663,12990699,2014-05-16,6269025,David,"When we were making up our mind Ron was an excellent communicator. And we arrived to find the unit was all we expected - and there were nice touches like wine and milk, freshly made banana bread and a new hot tub -  and everything we needed to start our stay. Ron gave us lots of good advice for our travels in Seattle and helped whenever we needed to find something in the apartment. It was well arranged for the three of us. Great neighbourhood and good parking. Overall Ron and his family were so welcoming that it was like staying with friends but with the welcome privacy of our own place."
1802663,13142642,2014-05-20,1437027,Elaine,"Ron is a terrific host. The house is located in a terrific neighborhood. It is close to downtown but quiet and safe. The yard is gorgeous with flowers. We really enjoyed the salt water hot tub and fresh banana bread. There is a private entrance and street parking, so it is easy to run to the car if needed. The apartment has several windows and is bright and cheery. All in all, a great time."
1802663,13280922,2014-05-24,14663760,Ian,"We stayed in Ron's apartment whilst visiting our son in Fremont. The flat was wonderfully presented and Ron was an excellent host. He greeted us upon arrival and made us feel like old friends. The apartment was supplied with fresh fruit, breakfast supplies, orange juice, milk, coffee, and even a bottle of wine. To top it all off there was a vase with fresh flowers from the garden. The apartment was very clean and well appointed, with just the right amount of space for two people. We would happily stay with Ron again and recommend his place to anyone wishing for a stay in Wallingford with easy access to Fremont and Downtown Seattle. Bonus features included access to the Patio with a BBQ, PLUS a Hot Tub Spa that Ron made available in his beautifully presented garden."
1802663,13856284,2014-06-06,15608623,Roger,Ron was extremely welcoming and easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again if in the city.
1802663,13975095,2014-06-09,15578099,Joe,Our hosts Ron and Cheryl were awesome. The urban oasis was just that and lived up to it's description. It's close to lots of good food and all the good stuff Seattle has to offer.
1802663,14190850,2014-06-14,14996628,Sanhita,"We had a great stay with Ron and Cheryl. They were very warm and welcoming and we had a absolutely fantastic stay. Loved the garden where we could sit and have tea in the evenings. We couldn't enjoy the hot tub due to our schedule but it did look extremely attractive. In terms of facilities, having an ironing board and hair dryer was very useful. However one of the highlights were all the reading material about Seattle available at the flat as well as the personal recommendations from the host which were very helpful. Definitely my first choice for a stay when I return."
1802663,14240545,2014-06-15,15858666,Eileen,"Urban oasis is the prefect name for this delightful spot. The accommodations  were perfectly charming and completely comfortable! Wine, chocolate, coffee, juice, banana bread and apples and energy bars for the road! They truly thought of everything. Will definitely go back and allow time for the salt water hot tub! Delightful experience."
1802663,14618450,2014-06-23,15090729,Lisa,"Loved the neighborhood and the apartment.  Perfectly named ""Urban Oasis!""  Would gladly stay there again!"
1802663,15302780,2014-07-07,3685016,Vicki,"The Urban oasis in Seattle was just as pictured in the profile.  Ron & Carol graciously parked elsewhere, opening a street parking slot for easy access from the street.  The location is quiet and great for getting out and around Seattle.  The homemade banana bread and breakfast foods, plus the nice bottle of wine & cheese was a nice touch.  While we never had a chance to try out the hot tub, we did find the deck and garden chairs a nice respite after the days sightseeing. Miki was a charming greeter, always welcoming a pat on the head."
1802663,15747449,2014-07-15,9354051,Shorey,"We loved staying at this house in seattle. The backyard was amazingly beautiful, lush and green, and the hot tub was beyond awesome.

Ron was exceptionally easy to work with as a host - very responsive. They even left us a bottle of wine and fresh baked banana bread!

The living space was totally acceptable. Bedroom was quite comfortable, as was the fold-out futon. The only thing we missed was a full kitchen, but who really needs that in Seattle?"
1802663,15917585,2014-07-18,16643460,Sheila,"Our stay was delightful. The apartment was cozy and clean, with some additional amenities that we were treated to upon arrival. It was a pleasure working with Ron from reservation to check-out. He was professional, responsive, and a kind communicator of house rules. The neighborhood is lovely and an easy jaunt to many popular areas of Seattle. I would highly recommend this apartment, particularly for visitors with children or for those who prefer to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood of Seattle. Thumbs up. "
1802663,16058795,2014-07-21,3270605,Jen,"location, location, location! I loved the easy walking distance to shops, parks, cafes, and more. A quick ten minute drive into the city or easy access to all freeways makes for a super convenient location.

It was obvious they went well beyond the basic necessities by baking scones, leaving a bottle of wine, etc. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and definitely enjoyed the hot tub sitting amid their backyard oasis."
1802663,16248183,2014-07-24,15338656,Sherry,"Ron's home exceeded my expectations in every way.  From the warm welcome, banana bread (everyone loved that), hot tub robes, milk and juice in the fridge, breakfast fixings, comfortable bed, and a beautiful home.  We all loved staying there.  Would definitely stay here again!"
1802663,16453339,2014-07-28,13503585,Jens-Erik,We had a lovely stay at this cute house in a beautiful residential neighborhood. We were in town for a wedding and felt this was a great place to stay for the weekend. All the little touches like the granola and snacks were a special treat.
1802663,19204019,2014-09-08,11459444,Stephanie,"We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The neighborhood was super cute & so close to many attractions that weren't touristy. We could walk the neighborhood & go to great bars, restaurants & parks. I highly recommend going to Gas works park to watch the sunset. Downtown is a short 10 minute drive. Ron & his wife were very reachable.  The apartment was very clean & they went above & beyond as hosts. They have the sweetest dog who greeted us routinely when we came back in the evening.  They also let us use their hot tub."
1802663,19515625,2014-09-14,16724720,Joseph,"We had a great stay in Wallingford. It served as a great launching point for the many neighborhoods we visited (by car and by foot), and we felt very welcomed and comfortable. The location is within easy walking distance of Gas Works Park, which has a great view of the city, and a lot of good food. We really appreciated the groceries that came stocked in the kitchenette (including a bottle of wine and fresh banana bread), and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The hot tub was a great way to relax in the evenings, and towels and robes were provided. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
1802663,19897288,2014-09-20,14304184,Alan,"I had a great experience at Ron & Cheryl's. I was made most welcome and the apartment is everything they say it is. The extras including banana bread, cherry tomatoes and wine were greatly appreciated. Location was perfect for me being a nice stroll over to Fremont. Couldn't have asked for more."
1802663,20348875,2014-09-28,20091787,Susan,"This ended up being a great location for my husband and I to stay while in Seattle to visit our daughter and son-in-law.  Comfy bed (softer than I am used to but kind of felt like sinking into a cloud) and Cheryl, Ron's wife left the often-complimented banana bread, wine and a cheese spread in the fridge.  Because we were with family did not spend alot of time at the apartment, but I definitely took advantage of that awesome hot tub every day.  The only condition I would express to others, is that we were definitely not used to so much parallel and street parking, but seems to be the norm in Seattle.
"
1802663,37896869,2015-07-11,17640398,Nikki,"We loved our stay here! Ron and his wife were kind, gracious hosts, and the suite is wonderful--spacious and clean, in a beautiful neighborhood. We'd definitely come back!"
1802663,38309321,2015-07-14,4686916,Kim,"We really enjoyed our stay in the Wallingford neighborhood.    Ron, Cheryl and Miki were fabulous hosts, and had many great tips regarding the area and things to do.  The lower level apartment is clean and very comfy.  A special thanks from my son Luke for the Nelson Cruz bobble head! 
 Kim and Luke."
1802663,38865455,2015-07-19,22665042,Tiffany,"Wow! Ron really did a great job making me and my boyfriend feel welcome. He went out of his way to provide us with information about the area and giving a tour of the apartment and backyard. The description of the space was accurate and the neighborhood was awesome. Parking seems like it could be tricky, but Ron has reserved one space for a car. Nice and quiet home with great amenities, including a small book library, television with Netflix, and a great complimentary bottle of wine, beer, banana bread, breakfast items and snacks. This rental is fabulous. Slept like a champ and found this to be a great base for exploring the neighborhoods of Seattle and Mt. Rainier Nat'l Park."
1802663,39500922,2015-07-24,1524440,Chandra,Clean space with a great location.
1802663,40200497,2015-07-29,29377463,Laura,"Thank you both - the wine, banana bread, coffee, many little extras - and especially the warm welcome and conversations made this a great starting point for our west coast vacation. The hot tub to start our day was great! And the location to Seattle and all the attractions we had planned to do was perfect! Thanks again and blessings to you! Alan, Laura, Ian   "
1802663,40616817,2015-08-01,12483342,Karen,"Great stay with Cheryl and Ron. The apt was perfect for my daughter and I. The location is fabulous! Loved the banana bread , breakfast items and wine! ..and the hot tub! loved that. "
1802663,42645419,2015-08-15,21200975,Aki,"Jast like the reviews from others, as we arrived to the house we wel lgreeted by Ron who was cheerful. Hehad drinks,fruits snack and homemade banana bread cheese and abotlle of wine for us!  we wel lvery pleased to have such warm welcoming. Ron and Cheryl well very kind and helpful.
The house is located near QFC, cafe and restaurant all at a walking distance but it was also a very quiet and nice neighbor nood."
1802663,46220173,2015-09-08,4390988,Shelbyrae,"This house truly is a sanctuary. The inside is very welcoming, calming,
and stylish. Ron made sure we had everything we needed and even welcomed us with a bottle of wine! The best part about this place is the backyard. The saltwater hot tub is incredible. We relaxed in the lounge chairs on the lawn, but had our pick of two other decks. Amazing choice! Will definitely be back. "
1802663,47048095,2015-09-15,7401884,Lee,"Ron is a wonderful host. There was wine and fruit and freshly baked banana bread (and butter!) waiting when I arrived. Ron greeted me in person, showed me around the flat and made sure I was comfortable.

Great neighborhood and an easy walk to a supermarket, coffee shops, restaurants.

Comfortable and cozy flat with all the accouterments. Even the weather was sunny (although I don't know how much influence Ron had...)"
1802663,47706869,2015-09-21,26643134,Brandy,"My fiancee and I couldn't have asked for a better host and place to stay while visiting family in Seattle. The title of this listing is totally true - it's an urban oasis! Ron and Cheryl are amazing and the apartment is fantastic--after being welcomed with wine and freshly baked banana bread, we knew we'd really hit the jackpot. AND there's a hot tub!!! It's so relaxing and perfect. Ron recommended an incredible hike in Mt Rainier National Park and we had a great time -- the views from all points of the hike are spectacular. We really hope that Ron's home is free the next time we are in Seattle because it's the best! 
"
1802663,48424396,2015-09-26,6897466,Sally,"Just a perfect home from home!! 
Having travelled a long way from home Ron very kindly agreed to pick us up from the airport - door to door service and then we arrived at our new home for the week.
The house is set in a quiet friendly neighbourhood although you are only a few blocks away from parks, restaurants, bars and public transport to anywhere in Seattle. Ron had kindly provided us with bus timetables, local recommended eateries (Julia's Yum Yums or Chirozo Scramble for breakfast = lovely, Molly Moon's ginger ice cream hmmm just perfect) and a wealth of knowledge about the area.
Ron and Cheryl are the perfect hosts, the flat has everything you will need including wine, chocolate and yummy banana bread!!

It was our 1st visit to Seattle and we loved it - you have to check out the glass gardens downtown, the lovely walk around Green Park in the local neighbourhood and a little further afield take the ferry to Bainbridge and walk round the quaint shops, sample ice cream and have a wee visit to Bloedel Gardens.

In summary thanks Ron for a great experience, your place is just right and loved our wee conversations about the world and it's people.
"
1802663,49012010,2015-09-30,41437969,Haol,"We had a great stay with Ron, who was a great host and very helpful. We needed a portable crib for our toddler and Ron was kind enough to research this and rent one for us at the last minute. The home is in a great location very convenient to all the tourist activities around Seattle. There are also lots of restaurants within walking distance, as well as a nice park where we took our daughter to play. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful, and we loved the cozy deck in the backyard. "
1802663,49782414,2015-10-06,9311894,Kevin,"Ron was an amazing host! Even though I didn't stay there, he treated my parents with the utmost respect. They enjoyed chatting with him and appreciated such a wonderful and welcoming place to stay. I highly recommend Ron as a host and wish him and his wife the best in their future endeavors!"
1802663,53467322,2015-11-09,43817485,David,"Ron was an excellent host, he welcomed us, told us about the neighborhood and greater Seattle. He provided coffee, tea, banana bread, milk and orange juice, as well as a great chocolate bar. The location fit our needs perfectly, close to our daughter and the University of Washington and easy access to Seattle sites. "
1802663,53897514,2015-11-14,19876797,Linda,"Couldn't imagine a more welcoming host or a more comfortable spot to spend time in Seattle.   Ron and Cheryl have thought of everything, having snacks and breakfast items available was especially nice.  We will definitely be back!


"
1802663,57170554,2015-12-22,7076721,Jesse,Ron is an incredible host and was very accommodating on our short notice needs. He has a beautiful space and is a very warm and welcoming person. Highly recommended!

1898511,8880579,2013-11-23,9472235,Mark,"Nikki and William were very gracious hosts and had an immaculate space. The room was quiet, comfortable and spacious. I only stayed for one night, but William was kind enough to make breakfast in the morning. Overall, a great experience and recommended to all."
1898511,9256370,2013-12-16,5650356,Christine,We had such a wonderful time with Nikki and William. They have a beautiful home and are great hosts! We loved talking to them about our future travel plans and they gave us such valuable tips about an upcoming trip. We would stay with them again in a heartbeat! Thanks!
1898511,9559939,2014-01-02,9377208,Arianna,Very pleasant- Nikki picked me up and dropped me off from the light rail which was very convenient :)
1898511,9719544,2014-01-06,10683317,Chase,"Nikki and William are perfect hosts! It was our first time visiting Seattle, and this beautiful house is the first reason that I fall in love with the city. We didn't stay in the house quite much, but received warm welcome from the hosts and their lovely kitten-Munchkin~

Hope we can visit Nikki and William next time!"
1898511,9987591,2014-01-23,6532984,Cissy,"We absolutely loved this listing! First off, Nikki and William are wonderful hosts - they always go out of their way to help (they picked us up and gave us a lift back to the station), they are super laid-back and kind, and they always help us polish the trip itinerary with a local's insight. The location is spectacular with easy, quick public transport access to downtown and their place is within walking distance to the International District. The house is clean, spacious, homely and the room is perfect for relaxation, comfort and privacy."
1898511,10351262,2014-02-15,9670266,Rowley,"Nikki and William were absolutely brilliant. They are warm, welcoming people and immediately made me feel at home. They were always able to talk in the evenings and recommend me things to do around the city, and never hesitated to include me in whatever was going on.
The house is exactly as pictured, and was very clean always. It's also well located with a bus stop into downtown located about 3 minutes walk away, which was a great help. As described it is an airbed provided, which is a decent size and more than comfortable enough. The house can be a little cold at times, but there is a strip heater provided in the room so it mostly wasn't a problem for me.
Overall I had a great time staying with them and would do it again in a second! Thanks so much guys!"
1898511,10647195,2014-03-01,4274504,David,"Great location, easy walk to a fleet of buses to take you somewhere. Kitty was adorable and loves the pets."
1898511,10666202,2014-03-02,12248322,Jacqueline,Our stay with Nikki & William was great. The room was spacious and clean. Nikki was very sweet and even offered to drive us to the light rail. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again :)
1898511,10729370,2014-03-04,8416447,Faith,"We absolutely loved staying with Nikki & William. They were super friendly & gracious, & we loved their cat Munchkin! Nikki even picked us up & dropped us off at the link station which was great. Thanks for being such great hosts!"
1898511,15731881,2014-07-14,3675987,Ivan,"Great place to stay! The hosts were super nice and the room is very comfortable. Conveniently located near downtown, I-90 and I-5 as well..."
1898511,16150246,2014-07-22,1416377,Katherine,"We enjoyed staying with Nikki and William. They were quite welcoming, easy to communicate with prior to our stay (despite major plane delays on our end), and made our stay very comfortable and easy. Their place is easy to get to from the airport (Link light rail), and there are several different buses  running regularly nearby that you can take into the city (you can pick up an Orca card at the Link stop... it's  an extra $5, but a lot easier than having exact fare for the buses all the time).

I was a little hesitant about sleeping on an air mattress with another person, but the mattress was firmly inflated, so the water-bed-effect of rolling around was minimized. 

Overall - comfy, clean, and a great deal!
(Also - Baja Bistro nearby was a great spot for breakfast!)

"
1898511,16507605,2014-07-28,18158878,Helen,"It was the first time I used Airbnb and the first time  I visited Seattle. I stayed 2 nights with Nikki, William, the kitty and their beautiful babygirl. 
I really felt at home at their lovely place. The room is very nice and comfy. Both were very helpful with all organization issues during my very short stay with them.  They are very easy to get along with. Loved to speak Spanish! 
Although I didn't know Seattle AT ALL it was quite ok to get to their place. There are buses very close to the house. On the second day I rented a car and there was also the chance to get a parking place in front of their house.
I would always recommend a stay with them!! 
"
1898511,16686493,2014-07-31,3064407,Vera Florentine,"We had a great time at Nikki and William's house. They were both great hosts and the atmosphere was laid back and relaxed. They provided us with a lot of information about the city and were very welcoming.

The house and room are spacious and clean. Buses are a five minute walk away and run on a regular basis, so we had quick and easy access to the the city center.

All in all we can highly recommend them."
1898511,17301192,2014-08-10,7539296,Erol,"Les hôtes n'étaient pas présents. 
L'espace chambre est plus exigu que prévu. Il y a un lit pour bébé, plus un lit d'une personne.  De plus, la chambre au dernier étage est sous les toits et sans climatisation. Enfin, lorsque la fenêtre est ouverte nous avons un bruit omniprésent de la highway située à proximité.
Cependant, la décoration est agréable et semble récente.
"
1898511,17461307,2014-08-12,8570285,Philip,"Comfortable room at a great price. House was pretty clean. Free wifi were a plus . Everthink worked well with them.

Great area, walking distance to downtown, beautiful and cosy room/house and a woderful Munchkin (their lovely cat) that kept me company when i was there alone!
Bonus: they are the nicest people i met in Seattle, too!"
1898511,18212768,2014-08-23,814424,Lena,We spend some nice days in Seattle. Nikki and William were great and very friendly hosts. They gave helpful recomendations for sightseeing and Nikki even brought us to the busstop with our baggage. Their sweet little doughter is very calm and easy. The room was nice and clean - like the whole appartment.
1898511,18282071,2014-08-24,20136318,Marissa,"This was my first experience using Airbnb so I really didn't know what to expect.

1898511,18567503,2014-08-28,18104447,Jakob,Thank you so much for having us stay at your place! We really loved Nikki and Williams welcoming! They were really friendly and helped us when we had some quistions! It was our first trip to the States and we from the start deceided that we would try airbnb. It was a succes! I recommend Nikki and William for those who havn't try airbnb! And we also liked the cat very much! Say hello from Janni and Jakob 
1898511,18800504,2014-09-01,17823952,Michael,"Awesome hosts!  Clean room!  I felt right at home!  For my first time utilizing a ""room share"" system, it was quite the experience.  I'm glad I was able to stay with such a welcoming couple.

Felt safe, comfortable and welcomed.

Thanks again Will and Nikki!"
1898511,18944736,2014-09-03,618508,Shivani,"Nikki and William are amazing hosts. They have a wonderful home that is both cozy and welcoming. Although I didn't see them much over the labor day weekend, when we did run into each other, they were absolutely delightful. The description and photos are exactly as described. Additionally the location is ideal to get around the city. I would also recommend downloading the uber app, and using their car service to get around. Overall, a very affordable stay with amazing hosts. "
1898511,19097434,2014-09-06,1478316,Matthew,"This is for a modest room in a gorgeous, quiet part of town. Nikki and William were generous and very kind hosts! I showed up way early and Nikki still allowed me to drop my luggage off and take a much needed  nap (Not the accommodation you even get in a hotel)! Not super close to all public transit but the walking you'll do to get where you need to go is quite beautiful. Perfect place from which to get acquainted with ""real"" Seattle, a city I can now safely say I love! Very well-behaved cat likes to hang out but the whole home is really clean and well taken care of. (I'm allergic to cats and I didn't have any reaction! That's how clean it was.) Overall, a lovely place to stay with super hosts- thank you Nikki and William!"
1898511,19319424,2014-09-10,4718603,Svetlana,"I had a very early flight and Nikki and William let me stop by in the morning to drop my things off which is very nice of them. They have a lovely baby that did not disturb our stay. I love their cat! (I think she loves me back :))
A very nice neighborhood and is within a few min to drive to the Seattle Center."
1898511,19435248,2014-09-12,12336748,Nathan,"Nikki and William were very friendly and welcoming.  The space was nice and quiet, WiFi was good, I enjoyed my fairly brief stay."
1898511,19506133,2014-09-13,1822156,Jacquie,Nikki and William were wonderful hosts! Everything was set up when we arrived and they even left a cute reminder note on the bathroom mirror for us! Parking was not an issue even though we arrived late at night. Communication was great and Nikki responded very quickly. I absolutely loved the fact that they had so many wonderful and convenient amenities available for use as well. When you're traveling/road tripping you forget a few things and it's nice to know that the hosts are willing to let you use some of their amenities.  Their cat Munchkin is ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE. Extra points for having an awesome cat. (:
1898511,19541468,2014-09-14,20147385,Yiting,Nikki and William are super nice and kind to guests. The room is clean and neat. We like it so much!!! 
1898511,19711422,2014-09-16,19540841,一鸣,"Very beautiful house! Very comfortable room! I love all the things in their family, so beautiful a baby and so lovely a cat! They two are nice and friendly!we have a beautiful journey in Seattle."
1898511,20113982,2014-09-23,10696461,Nikita,"They are amazing People. This is by far my best stay with airbnb.
The place is very close to downtown and close to the Intl Seattle airport. "
1898511,20324679,2014-09-27,18111623,DJ And Kara,"After a delay of several hours while riding the train, I found myself in need of last minute lodging, due to missing the last charter from downtown back to my home in Anacortes. Nikki and William accommodated me with just a few hours notice and a late night arrival. The room was clean, bed comfortable, and quiet. My only regret was not getting to meet them in person! Thanks for everything!"
1898511,20401264,2014-09-28,15873239,DongJun,"It was a great house which is located by beautiful park, also it is near the downtown. Nikki is really good host and the cat she has is so friendly"
1898511,20802378,2014-10-05,10086597,David,Really enjoyed my stay with Nikki and William.  They are a super friendly couple with a charming young daughter and a very charismatic cat.  Both are fluent in English and Spanish.  Their place is a modern duplex located in a residential section of one of Seattle's most diverse neighborhoods.  Spotless and immaculately maintained; good on-street parking too.  Would be happy staying with them again.  A big plus for me was the transit connection to the Eastside:  just 5-10 minutes away by car or bus across the I-90 floating bridge.  
1898511,21235733,2014-10-13,10497066,Harrison,"The room is clean and tidy,and the house is located in a beautiful area. It is easy to go to the downtown by takng bus/light rail plus 10 to 15 minutes walk. It is a good experience to live in the house of Nikki & William, thank you!"
5643240,35546404,2015-06-20,4274311,Kevin,"Great location, easy parking, private entrance -- nothing to not love about the space. Very neat and clean, Sara was very accommodating and available but not intrusive. Highly recommended!"
5643240,36179908,2015-06-26,6271914,Cynthia,"Sara's basement apartment is a great base from which to explore Seattle. Ballard and Fremont, two very cool neighborhoods, are well within walking distance and are definitely worth seeing. The bus to downtown picks up and drops off only a few blocks away.

Sara herself was a nice host, letting us have our privacy but being available for questions or concerns. We did run into some issues with the toilet in the basement apartment--it functioned the entire time, but we needed to refill the tank manually a few times. Sara was very responsive, however, fixing the issue the very next day after we let her know.

Overall, a good place to stay for travelers on a budget. "
5643240,36960371,2015-07-03,16307321,Blake,This experience was great. The basement apartment was exactly what I expected and all the little details were there including coffee filters and olive oil. 
5643240,40314185,2015-07-30,31471235,Daniel,"Sara's house is in an area of Ballard that consists of well-tended and landscaped private homes. The entrance to the apt could accessed by a walk from the front or, conveniently off an alley, large enough in which to drive a car. The entrance was through a clean garage that is pass-protected. The apt was clean and generous for the price with a nice-sized, airy bedroom, middle room and small, full kitchen. Since I was out with friends or family most of the time, I hardly saw my host. She did, however communicate with me most adequately by text and email.
   The house is only a few blocks from Ballard's main streets, NW Market St and 15th Ave NW. If I did not want to use Uber, I was able to reach Belltown, Downtown, Utown, Fremont, Capitol Hill, et. al. with nearby public transportation. There's a park and several pleasant brew-pubs nearby.

5643240,41592741,2015-08-08,6361856,Ulrika & Viktor,"Had a great stay at Sara's place. Scandinavians will feel especially welcome in this neighborhood, where they're flying our flags! Highly recommended."
5643240,45366442,2015-09-02,31794729,Cathy,The neighborhood was great. Very quiet. Buses within walking  distance. Sara even left a paper telling us about places in the neighborhood. Market right down the street. Another store the other way within wslking distance.
5643240,48190248,2015-09-24,28178058,Barb,"This stay was a gift to my dai
Utter and new son in law.  Theys were met with a card and a bOttle of champagne to celebrate! They were pleased with the accommodations and said the house was neat, and clean."
5643240,55653634,2015-12-04,18945330,Vanessa,"The basement apartment was exactly as expected from the pictures we saw online, and has everything needed for our stay. It has several nearby public transportation to reach several areas from Seattle. Sarah was a great host, very helpful and very responsive by email. The apartment was mostly clean, however we did have a problem with several spiders in the bedroom when we arrived. Also, the garage door was not very clean. Nevertheless, Sarah  provided everything necessarily for us to clean. "
1018204,4303768,2013-04-26,5706059,Giovanni,"Really nice and comfertable room, clean pleace and Monika was nice and she told me what to see and how to move around the city.
"
1018204,4385822,2013-05-01,3820775,Gerson,"The house is in an awesome location, a minute away from the buses that take you downtown. It's a quiet neighborhood so it's perfect for folks who just want to rest after a day of working or going around Seattle. The room is clean, cozy, and well-kept, has everything I need. Although the bathroom is in the main house, I didn't find it as a problem. Great value indeed."
1018204,4689304,2013-05-20,867600,Julio,"Well, it was a good stay, the location is ok, though i have to say it is quite alternative.  It was a surprise to see that the cabin does not have a bathroom and you have to go out and in the house to use the toilet.  definately not for anyone over 250 pounds, over 35 years of age, and over 5'10"" tall (you have to literaly crawl to the bed every time).  lot smaller that seen in the pictures.  it was more an adventure tan a comfortable place to stay.  For what i paid... understandable."
1018204,4739945,2013-05-22,2165876,Mitchell,"Cool, cozy little loft space, although it did smell of art studio until I opened the window. I really appreciated the flexible checkin/checkout arrangement, which was well suited to my unreasonably late arrival and early departure."
1018204,4808609,2013-05-27,6010789,Sandy,"This place was great, her instructions, rules, and over all place was clear and clean! If I ever go back to check out Seattle this will be the place to stay. Super close to the bus lines, nice neighborhood just great!  "
1018204,5122651,2013-06-13,6775393,Heidi,"leider war esnicht so fein, da die unterkunft alles andere als sauber war, die mistkübel gingen über, die küche und bad waren eher schmuddelig, die klobrille nicht fix montiert und sehr wackelig.  die bettwäsche war scheinbar nicht frisch überzogen, da sie nicht frisch roch und wir Haare drinnen fanden. wir dachten air b n´b ist schon so gedacht, dass es frühstück gibt.  davon war leider nichts zu bemerken, es gab wohl ein fach für b n´b guests wo altes ausgerauchtes cafepulver und zucker war, aber mehr auch nicht. der garten war wie eine müllhalde...wir hätten das haupthaus per hintereingang betreten sollen, nur war eine sprosse der holztreppe durchgebrochen und man hätte quasi einen dreiviertel meter etwas gefährlich überwinden müssen. die schlösser der verschiedenen Türen sind sehr eigen, wir brauchten fast immer 10min bis sich die türen öffnen ließen, man hatte das gefühl, dass man gleich die türschnalle in der hand hat und der schlüssel abbricht - mühsam! 
man soll dann noch alles putzen und waschen nach gebrauch und mistkübel ausleeren, bettwäsche abziehen (womit wir ja eh kein problem haben) aber dann wär es fein, wenn zumindest saubere schwämmchen und geschirrtücher zur verfügung stehen würden -alles sehr smelly... :-(
also für den preis hätten wir uns zumindest eine saubere unterkunft erwartet.dear Monica!"
1018204,5151053,2013-06-15,4274504,David,"The loft is great, even for a tall guy I was fine! Quiet and a good place to crash."
1018204,5280095,2013-06-22,6502251,Kellen,"Erin (who was our contact for this stay) was cool, relaxed, helpful, funny and nice. The other guests were interesting and friendly, the cat was cute.

The space is much smaller than it appears, especially the floor-to-ceiling distance; an average person can comfortably sit on the bed, but there's no place to stand up. The structure is also quite small (10x10, as stated in the listing) but because part of the lower level is screened off, opening and closing the door with luggage involved can be difficult. There's a small window to open for (very little) ventilation, but no screen. The lower window also needed a screen; we didn't feel like opening it after seeing a rat running around in the vines outside. Going in to the main house to use the bathroom was complicated by a broken step from the space to the back porch and by there being three other downstairs guests.

The house as a whole seems like a unfinished project.

"
1018204,5300637,2013-06-23,6808969,Megan,"The rental is extremely compact and simple, but perfect if what you're looking for is a place to rest your head at night. The accommodation was clean and while I didn't get to meet Monika, she was incredibly friendly and helpful leading up to our stay. Monika's house is located in a very quiet and charming area of Seattle. If you're looking for a cheap, safe place to sleep, I would absolutely recommend this accommodation. "
1018204,5396324,2013-06-28,5636508,Claire,"This was a good place to stay for a few days...it had all the basics covered. A much less personal experience than many other airbnb reservations in the past, but a great value overall."
1018204,5550287,2013-07-05,3991487,Martin,"Overall we had a great stay at Monika's place. We had to organize our belongings really well, because there is hardly any space to store stuff. Cleanliness ok. It felt a little bit like a Hostel, due to the many guests roaming around, which is a great way to meet people!"
1018204,5916317,2013-07-22,7054159,Diana,"I should of read the description of the loft more carefully. I didn't realize the loft was so small. It was a little inconvenient to have to go out of the cabin and into the main house through the back to get to a bathroom. Also because the light for the outside wasn't working. During my stay, I wasn't able to get wifi from the barn. The futon was heavily used with a deep dip in it. Other than that everything went smoothly. Only saw the host once though. The housemates are nice. Overall, it was a fair experience for the price."
1018204,5956494,2013-07-23,7512301,Lee,"The space was exactly as described -- small, cozy, and accesible.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a positive one."
1018204,6008527,2013-07-26,6886234,Julien,"Really great location. 10min walk of capital hill , quiet neighborhood, lot of bus for downtown.   
Attention it is really how the add describe it: it is small : impossible to stand up or hardly be seat in the sleeping area. Difficult to move in that space. The cabin is at the back,  for the bathroom you have to go down from the mezzanine and go outside to reach the house. For people who have pressing needs at night, it can be complicated.
It goes with the price!
But for our stay the bathroom was not clean...."
1018204,6138453,2013-07-31,64455,Sari,Good location! Cheap and worked fine for our shorts stay!
1018204,6163353,2013-08-01,7273315,Vilayvanh,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1018204,6314763,2013-08-07,7857951,Jinhee,"it's really back cabin loft!! 
and every thing is clean.

in my case, I wanna see the night view of seattle,
so I have to came back late, but cabin is separate,

that is so good for me.



"
1018204,6590256,2013-08-18,1260642,Maria,"We had a great stay at Monika's place! It is an awesome price, in a central location for Seattle, and close to a bus stop that takes you downtown (1 block away). Everything was clean and ready for us when we got there. We stayed in the back studio loft and it was small, but just what we were looking for. The place functions like a hostel but is a WAY better option than going to a hostel. Everyone is friendly and it's nice being in an actual home. We would stay here again if we are ever back in Seattle!"
1018204,6634301,2013-08-19,3760759,Carissa,"Great location and hospitality. 

Thanks!"
1018204,6759360,2013-08-24,370491,Frances,"The little cabin was perfect for me. I'd been traveling all day: 2 flights, a light rail ride, and a short bus ride up the hill from downtown...but after all that, I had a quiet, cozy little spot to myself. The cabin is nestled in the backyard, which is fenced in, and the bed is up in a little loft. I felt safe and I slept great (I had a nice breeze from the window!), but I was also within walking distance of a really fun neighborhood-- lots of cafes, bars, restaurants, and shops. Erinn was kind and accommodations were clean and comfortable. I'd definitely recommend this spot for future airbnb-ers, myself included! "
1018204,6877426,2013-08-28,7988143,Scott,"The room worked perfect for my weekend stay. The host was polite and professional. If I stayed longer, I would have used the full kitchen and laundry, but it was nice to know it was there. The access ability to major bus lines made travel easy and affordable. Great value overall."
1018204,6903772,2013-08-29,1669790,Jakob,Small and simple room in a garden house. Good and fast communication. Good opportunity to use the main house facilities. 
1018204,6951690,2013-08-31,3961524,Petra,It was a very nice cabin. it was really uncomplicated and easy. thanks so much!
1018204,7244253,2013-09-13,7611152,Charlotte,"Ok - for one night, but not more. "
1018204,7938158,2013-10-08,8350581,Frede,"Had a good stay in Monika's place. Unfortunately I didn,t met her, but the cabin was clean and comfy and the check-in/-out was well organized and therefore going smooth. Met her housemate Erin and her sweet little cat and some other airbnb people which were all very nice.Would stay there again.."
1018204,8032299,2013-10-13,5390085,Joan,"The cabin i stayed in for one night was clean and very very comfortable. It's a small space, but it was cozy! the only downside was that the bathroom was in the main house, which meant having to go out in the cold to let myself into the main house so i could use the bathroom. i liked that the house is steps away from major bus lines, and i was able to take one bus all the way downtown under 20 minutes. overall a pleasant experience, and Erinn was very friendly and welcoming. Thank you Monikka and Erinn! "
1018204,8199673,2013-10-20,7976268,Zachary,The ceiling up at the top was a little low but not prohibitively so.  The place was clean and as advertised.  The location is good and the cost is excellent.  Good privacy as you're in your own little building.
1018204,8431763,2013-10-30,3264174,Alicia,"We found this stay to be exactly as described. It was well-organized and instructions and expectations were clear. While we never met or spoke to Monika, she did communicate with us adequately via email. 

We stayed in the back cabin, and if you do too, be advised that the area for you to occupy consists of about 4' x 15' on the first floor of the cabin (we put our shoes, coats & bags here), and then a loft that is accessible by a ladder and is about 15' x 15' and has a very well-used but cozy futon mattress. At its highest point I could sit up comfortably in the loft (I'm 5'4""). If you have to pee in the middle of the night, you will need to put on your shoes, go outside, and unlock the main house to do so. This was all communicated in the ad on AirBnB but I'm saying it again in case people miss that part! 

Great location, and perfect for our needs, which was for a cheap crash pad that was clean and cozy. Thank you Monika!"
1018204,8513260,2013-11-03,125678,Niki,"If you don't have the best mobility or you're looking for tons of space, this loft is not for you. With that being said, Monika's studio nook/sleeping space does have some serious charm in its own right.

I felt like I was a kid again, and the loft was my (more comfortable, heated) treehouse. You literally can climb away from it all and escape the hustle and bustle of grown-up life. I met Erinn who manages the goings-on and she (and her kitty) are quite friendly.

Like all adult treehouses, they aren't perfect. Don't forget to utilize the provided space heater as it does get very chilly. The bathrooms are located in the main house so if nature calls in the night - you'll be walking in the dark. 

You can't beat the location, or the price, but be prepared to clean up after yourself. Leave no trace, that's my motto!
"
1018204,8700962,2013-11-12,9671959,Alejandro,"I stayed for about a week and as promised it was a great little place. I enjoyed the quiet and private space in the back. While if I came into the main house everyone staying there was friendly. Didn't have any issues with access to the bath nor kitchen. I had one little mishap and lost my set of keys but I was able to quickly get a hold of Monika and get them replaced with a little effort on my part too. But she was cool about it. I would say it does get a bit cold inside the cabin at night. There is a small heater inside but I didn't like leaving it on overnight. Overall a great little place for that price.

Thanks Again Monika!"
1018204,8744817,2013-11-15,7344626,Angeline,"The back loft was exactly as advertised.  The space and the neighboring house were clean and efficient.  The loft is cozy and quiet, and (thankfully) the heat had been turned on before I got there, so the little space was toasty.  Monika's instructions and directions were clear and helpful.  This would not be a place for anyone with mobility issues as there is a ladder to enter the loft, and a ladder to enter the house (from the back where the loft is).  I was grateful that there was free parking close by...a real plus for me."
1018204,8806280,2013-11-18,1455011,Mark,"Although I never met Monika on this trip, I can tell a lot about her.  She replied to my request within minutes.  She has exceptional directions to the house and about the house.  And everything was great.  I enjoyed not being downtown, but close enough to walk anywhere I needed to go.  
And it is true, you cannot stand up in the loft, but after I walked all day all I wanted to do was lie down."
1018204,9038206,2013-12-02,10114365,Sarah,Everyone was friendly and this place was really cute! My stay went perfectly. 
1018204,9299166,2013-12-19,10462555,Tim,"Great place to stay! Clean and private, didn't mind sharing a bathroom inside the main house at all. Close to Capitol Hill and I even walked downtown a few times. Buses pick up and drop off a block away. Would definitely stay here again!"
1018204,9564933,2014-01-02,517812,Shelley,"The Back Cabin Loft was exactly as described in the listing.  It was perfect, cozy and warm. The bed sheets were really nice too. I'd definitely stay at the cabin again. "
1018204,9691050,2014-01-05,10726276,Lena,"We stayed in the Cherry Hill Cabin for two nights, when we were in Seattle. Even though we didn't meet Monika personally, everything worked perfectly. We met her roommate Erin and were also greeted by her beautiful and friendly cat. 
The Cabin is exactly that, a cabin, and since you have to climb a ladder to get to your bed, the accommodation is not practical for everyone, but we enjoyed the cozyness it offered.
For us the location was perfect, it was easy to reach with public transportation and it was easy to navigate around the city. 
There is a Trader Joe's and a local co-op market nearby (15 min walk) and the possibility of using a kitchen made our stay very comfortable.

If I get the chance to return to Seattle, I would definitely come back here! :)"
1018204,9764607,2014-01-08,2621461,Bryn,"I love this place!! Super comfy, very affordable, and really nice people to stay with.  Monika knew I was coming in pretty late on a cold rainy seattle night, and had the place toasty warm.  Thank you!! ;-)"
1018204,9896216,2014-01-17,10801260,Madison,"Great little place, make sure to walk to Ezells chicken for Oprah's favorite fried chicken. Also ,about a mile or so away is Central Cinemas we caught a $1 movie while being served some good food and great beer! Would definitely stay here again"

  I went across the street to the Swedish Hospital for a affordable breakfast in their cafeteria including Starbucks coffee.
  I would stay there again."
1018204,10093697,2014-01-30,11170278,Hironobu,"Very affordable.  The place was nice and cozy.  On top of that, it was a good location so easy for me to access downtown."
1018204,10169493,2014-02-03,4923454,Daniel,"Back Cabin Loft @ Cherry Hill House was great.  You can't beat the price, the location was central to downtown Seattle, and everything was exactly as described.  The loft space is small but the mattress is comfortable.  The pillows weren't stellar so if you're picky, bring your own.  But otherwise, everything was great.  The kitchen and bathroom were large and clean, I could come and go as I please, the loft was quiet, and the neighborhood was safe and accessible to lots of bars and restaurants.  For $40 a night, you can't beat it.  I would stay here again."
1018204,10226437,2014-02-07,11167615,Ryan,"Not a bad place to stay if you are in the Capitol Hill area. Everything was self explanatory and if you tend to be a bit less social, the hosts will leave you be. Neat little hideaway."
1018204,10310700,2014-02-12,5310063,Sophie,"Thank you. We had a great stay here. Great location, easy for buses and walking. Place was tidy and a comfortable stay! "
1018204,10351777,2014-02-15,8050431,Steph,"Monica's cabin loft is a perfect place to stay for travelers on a budget! You get the privacy of having basically your own house, and the convenience of a shared house just outside the door. I also appreciated the option of doing my laundry there. Recommended for all Seattle travelers. "
1018204,10461077,2014-02-19,6503539,Harrison,"I was visiting Seattle with a couple of friends, but stayed an extra day due to the cheaper cost of my plane ticket. I found Monika's listing on airbnb and decided that due to my situation, it was both cheap enough and close enough of a walk for me to get to from the Light Rail station off of Westlake. I didn't know what to expect, but the cozy loft suited me very well. There was enough privacy (the cabin isn't connected to the main house), enough comfortableness, and enough character that I greatly enjoyed my experience here. "
1018204,10489566,2014-02-21,2074379,Ferd,"Although my plans changed due to weather/moving circumstances, Monika was extremely on point with communication. Will definitely consider staying when I return to Seattle. Thx"
1018204,10566339,2014-02-25,9888626,Nathan,You get what you pay for and this was worth every dollar spent. Extremely easy to get to and from. Had all the amenities that one might need. Besides a sticky door and a flickering light there are no complaints coming from me
1018204,10683213,2014-03-03,11540425,Chris,"My stay here was great! Great location and reliable hosts. There was a limited amount of space in the cabin for someone who's 6'5"", but I knew that going in.

Very well organized and accommodating. Would stay here again!"
1018204,10736345,2014-03-04,11797985,Natchra,"My partner and I stayed here last minute. We really liked it. I guess I didn't read closely because I didn't thought the space had it's own bathroom. Kind of a pain to get bundled in the rain just to go in the main house to use the restroom. The bed was comfy enough,  the space was warm and clean and the hosts (or her housemates? ) were very friendly,  helpful and inviting!  We enjoyed our stay, and would recommend it to others :)"
1018204,10796836,2014-03-08,11334574,Jackson,"Mmm... Es exactamente lo que obtienes x lo que estas pagando... Lean bien la descripción y vean si es lo q estan buscando para que puedan tomar su decisión...
A mi me parecio un buen vecindario, si es una buena opcion o no creo depende de las posibilidades de cada quien, una vez mas recomiendo que lean bien toda la descripción cumple muy bien con la realidad, yo fui para mi luna de miel y me quede 4noches y a mi me funciono...
It's exactly what you get for what you pay... Make sure to read all rules and description in the profile and think about is what you want... I went there for 4 nights and for me was good... (For my honey moon)   "
1018204,10860167,2014-03-10,2621461,Bryn,"Nice comfortable space, real close to downtown and Capitol Hill.  Awesome!!"
1018204,11063594,2014-03-18,6254647,Yves,My stay with Monika was pretty awesome definitely recommend it for people who just need a spot to crash.
1018204,11101755,2014-03-20,13045920,Johanna,"The only thing this place has going for it is that it is central located.
For the ammount of correspondance you receive from the host regarding house rules, cleaning instructions, misc details, gave us a false expectation of how well looked after and tidy this place would be.
Considering we booked and paid extra for two people, we where quite disappointed having just one pillow and towel for our first night. We wouldn't have cared so much about this if it hadn't been for all detailed instructions of all the things that where required of us as guest. They (the hosts) didn't seem to have the same expectaions of themselves as they do of their guests.
We have no idea how this place got such high ratings for cleanliness.
We wouldn't stay at this place again."
1018204,11221673,2014-03-25,7684970,Diana,"Close to a direct bus downtown, clean and affordable. My partner and I enjoyed it but it is small and you can’t stand up when you are in the top floor. You also need to go out into the main house for the bathroom and kitchen. Everybody was nice and quiet so if these two things aren’t detractors, you’ll have a good stay. "
1018204,11288503,2014-03-28,12506652,Melanie,We were comfortable and we had everything we need. The Housemates were welcoming and it was a very easy spot to stay in.
1018204,11380344,2014-03-31,13424083,Remy,"I stayed at the back cabin loft for one night, it is very convenient, close to bus stop. This is not very big but ok for sleep. The hosts are very friendly. 
"
1018204,11489588,2014-04-05,10666759,Alistair,Definitely a great location and cool little piece of Seattle to base yourself. I enjoyed passing through here on my big west coast trip. 
1018204,11620616,2014-04-09,13080150,James,"I actually didn't see anybody there. For whatever reason, anytime I went to use the bathroom, I didn't see any guests. So overall it was a quiet, secluded experience which I didn't mind. The back cabin loft was clean, with fresh sheets and towels. It's the perfect size for two people traveling on the cheap. Also, I loved that there was a bus stop right in front of the house that would take you to and from downtown Seattle. Overall, the price and the housing were perfect and I wouldn't mind staying again."
1018204,12615551,2014-05-06,12761618,Jason,"What a wonderful little spot right next to heart of Downtown Seattle.  The room was exactly as described and I could not be happier with the accommodations and the hostess!  Thank you so much, I can solidly recommend this."
1018204,13163175,2014-05-20,10993718,Sara,"The loft was as expected, and the housemates were welcoming. I had an allergic reaction in the middle of the night which cleared up as soon as I left- it may have been from the cat in the main house. I don't see any previous reviews with this issue, but I wanted to mention it for others with allergies. Otherwise, the loft is exactly as described in the listing."
1018204,13818980,2014-06-05,10440475,Susan,"This was a cute place to stay and the description provided was accurate. It's a shed in the backyard in close proximity to the house. You stay in the upper loft of the shed (which you can't stand up in) and it's cozy. They include a fan and keep the window cracked open so it stays cool; the bed was comfortable and the area was clean; it has several power outlets. Only minor issues with the loft were we were only given one towel for two people, the ceiling light was burned out, and the lamp next to the bed didn't work because it was missing the chain.

Access to the house for the kitchen and the bathroom was easy. There was some bathroom congestion in the morning, and the washer/drier was in near constant use, but the hosts made good attempts to clear out and accommodate you.

It's a great location close to downtown and you can easily walk or take the bus to get around. The hosts were friendly although we didn't see much of them (and they didn't mind that we arrived pretty late and got up very early some mornings). The loft was cozy and comfortable. I would definitely stay at this location again. "
1018204,13981619,2014-06-09,961715,Mindy,"Cherry Hill House was a nice place to sleep between our jam packed tourist explorations. The space is just as pictured, with clean sheets, blankets. It was comfortable and a good bargain. It's nothing fancy, good for backpackers, the cabin smelled a bit like sawdust, and a family of squirrels ran around on the roof every morning as they jumped from trees to the fence. I didn't realize that the restroom is shared with other Airbnb guests (in the front cabin, living room, and rooms), however I don't spent large amounts of time in the bathroom so there wasn't any difficulty accessing it. The neighborhood has plenty of parking, and buses driving by very often. The neighborhood feels safe. Monika left us very clear instructions. We did not get to meet her because we were out from morning til night. The garden and yard are under construction."
1018204,49496222,2015-10-04,12186978,Cristy&Gregory,"We did not get a chance to meet Monika but her house manager, Ryan was very nice. When we arrived early he was kind enough to show us where to store our bags and recommend some nearby restaurants. 

The loft was a cool little spot. We were a bit worried that we would be cold but the heater provided worked really well and the bed was very comfortable! 

Unfortunately one of the neighbours seemed to be hosting a party that was very loud which made it difficult to sleep, we had an early morning the next day. Wifi didn't work so well in the loft but was easy to access in the house. 

"
1018204,49839133,2015-10-06,39819714,Sergio,"The Back Cabin Loft @ Cherry Hill House was a cute little home away from home.  When we walked up the house we were instantly greeted by Ryan, was kind enough to let us know what we needed to know and answered any of our questions. The loft had a heater which helped with the chilly night and the bed was very comfortable.  We had no problem getting WiFi with our laptops, and it let us get some work done at night. Although we had the loft booked for 2 night, we only ended up sleeping there one night... Only because we watched the Seahawks game with a friend in bellevue and they offered to let us stay the night. Otherwise we would of had no issue staying there the second night, if we ever visit Seattle again this will be one of the first places we check for availability! "
1018204,50332653,2015-10-11,16356273,Andrew,"Had everything we need lined up and ready to go, for the cost we got exactly what we expected. A bed, a shower, and place to keep our stuff safe while we explored the city! recommended if on a budget. "
1018204,51324076,2015-10-19,44460367,Peter,"Place was very cozy and felt like a tiny house. The Cabin, Kitchen, and Bathroom were super clean. "
1018204,51655965,2015-10-22,44534328,Mike,The room was exactly as described.  It was a great stay.  Nice and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. It's also in a great location that's easy access to anywhere downtown.  
1018204,51767103,2015-10-24,27872824,Aurora,"Easy access, quiet, quaint. Excellent proximity to Swedish Cherry Hill (right across the street). Loft and house were clean. Excellent value! Thanks again! "
1018204,52515989,2015-10-30,6713082,Julia,"The cabin in the back yard and the location are really lovely. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to meet Monika but Ryan was super nice. Thank you."
1018204,52710405,2015-11-01,4773464,Delphine,The back cabin loft was cozy and totally adorable.  I enjoyed having a quiet space all to myself.  Ryan was super accommodating and happy to answer any questions.  The location is also very convenient.  I would totally stay here again!
1018204,53247173,2015-11-07,42586153,Angela,"We enjoyed the warm and cozy cabin, and the hosts were very helpful. Would absolutely love to stay with Ryan and Monika again in the future. "
1018204,53465083,2015-11-09,43441659,Chelsea,"I was checking in kind of late and left really early in the morning so I did not have a chance to meet either Monika or Ryan but my stay was absolutely lovely. The cabin was just as described and it was so cozy! I slept up on the bigger bed up top and slept great, so comfy! There was a space heater that warmed the space up really nice. Only about a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle (so nice!) Quick trip to Seattle but very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend Monika and Ryan's place to anyone looking for a homely place away from home to stay!"
1018204,54163244,2015-11-16,1973009,Chris,"Cute self contained unit. Facilities in house were good. Good location for practical stay in Seattle.
Thanks Monika"
1018204,54390576,2015-11-19,47585180,Jessica,"Monika was wonderful to work with. She was quick to respond to my messages and her listing was very informative. The Back Cabin Loft at Cherry Hill was adorable and the loft bed was very comfortable. Ryan made himself available to help us with anything we needed via phone if he wasn't at the house. Everything was warm and clean, and pretty much what I expected. We would definitely stay at the ""Big Kid Clubhouse"" (what my husband called the loft) again! All in all it was a great first experience with AirBNB."
1018204,54470184,2015-11-20,5565491,Elisa,"The location was very convenient, definitely a good deal for a short stay in Seattle. Nice and mellow, low key; what you see is what you get. "
1018204,56378851,2015-12-13,45477270,Brett,Ryan was excellent at accommodating myself and all other guests that were staying in the house. The location was great: close enough for easy access to downtown and Capital Hill but far enough away to have peace and quiet.
1018204,56735574,2015-12-17,49592250,Michelle,It was okay. It's really hard to share a bathroom with so many people. It's okay for one night but not for many nights. My friends and I probably won't stay here again.
1018204,56799629,2015-12-18,35065031,John,"I had a great stay. Monika and Ryan were nice and helpful. The location is fairly close to downtown with easy access to public transit. 

The cabin was nice and cozy. After a day of walking around in the Seattle rain, the sleeping loft was so warm and comfortable. "
9328278,56274023,2015-12-11,49668596,Rosemary,"Blake and Steven were amazing host. Their home is clean, spacious beautiful, and full of charm. They provided all the amenities you would need and more. They also have a ton of information of the nearby areas and some great suggestions. It was my first time using airbnb and they made experience enjoyable and unforgettable. If I am ever in the Seattle area I would be more than happy to use this listing again."
9328278,56429357,2015-12-13,50333531,Brandon,"Very wonderful place to stay in West Seattle. Private entrance, kitchen, and bathroom. Street parking was a plus. The bedroom was warm and full of charm. Loved the kitchen to make a cup of tea. There was even shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom with fresh towels. Really enjoyed staying here"
9328278,56648242,2015-12-15,37914548,Elena,"Storybook was extremely well organized. Information was clear, and when I messed up on the dates for my reservation they were super accommodating. The entire place smelt amazing and the decor and lighting were warm and comfy. I felt safe and like I was just at home. This was the third Air bnb I have stayed at and without a doubt the best. "
9328278,57000709,2015-12-20,20569605,Lydia,"From my arrival to my departure, Storybook was a completely enchanting experience. As I walked up the steps by the sweet garden, I suddenly felt all my stress melt away. As a solo female traveler, security is very important. So, first I want to emphasize how safe I felt on every level. As I walked into my immaculate space, I suddenly felt like I had come home. Not only did I feel comfortable, but my hosts, Blake and Steve,provided me with a concise and clear write up of the local area and information about Storybook . As I walked into the crisp and clean kitchen, I discovered that Blake had written a warm and welcoming  message to me in colorful chalk on a very cool and unique chalkboard!  As I walked into the bedroom, I heard music...It was coming from a beautiful video of winter scenes ...relaxing and festive. A very nice touch. My hosts had also decorated my room with sparkling lights. It had felt like a favorite aunt was welcoming me back home. Before turning in for the night, I had a delightful conversation with both Blake and Steve who were intent on making my stay as pleasant as possible. What a lovely and caring couple! My bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was very quiet and restful. In the morning, I made myself a cup of delicious cup of coffee, and I perused the incredible assortment of lovely children's books and art books that were thoughtfully arranged throughout the studio. For a while, I could fondly remember my favourite childhood stories. As I packed up my belongings and locked the door behind me, the chimes from above bid me adieu as I walked back into the busy world. I'll be back! Thank you, Blake and Steve! :)"
9328278,57680009,2015-12-28,9424284,Matt,"We had such a amazing time staying at Storybook! If you are looking for a cozy, quiet , and perfectly located home in Seattle this is the spot!  The hosts Blake and Steven were very prompt and helpful to any questions we might have had! I most definitely will recommend this amazing studio to friends and family who plan to visit the area! Thank you again Blake and Steven!  You helped us make our holiday weekend the best of all! Anyone with a group of 4 or less would be silly not to stay there!"
9328278,58177743,2016-01-01,38182489,Olivia,The room is exactly as it appears in the photos. Blake did a wonderful job of providing information about local activities.
9533803,55540289,2015-12-01,545048,Kyle,"Paloma and her boyfriend were so wonderfully welcoming. We were their second guests but we would have never been able to tell. 

They gave us all the info and were really great to communicate with. Would definitely stay again!"
9533803,56966657,2015-12-20,26472201,Rudolf,"A wonderfully clean place and a very nice room in a perfect location in Fremont. Paloma and her boyfriend were perfect hosts, easy to talk to and accommodating. A good place to stay!"
1750681,14119216,2014-06-12,5892300,Carmen,Beth is probably the most warmhearted and sharing person I have met not only through airbnb. Her place is a real home and her whole family seems to immediately adopt new guests if they let it. I had lovely talks with Beth and some of her relatives. She was helping out wherever she could to make my stay perfect. The house is bright and very clean and furnished with loving care. Busstop and supermarket are not even 5 minutes away. I loved staying with Beth and if I ever come back to Seattle I'll surely stay with her again.
1750681,14213780,2014-06-14,542105,Cherlynn,Beth is absolutley wonderful. Such a loving gentle spirit and great traveler herself. I feel I've made a new friend
1750681,14309824,2014-06-16,14254772,A May,自己一个人在美国停留的第一站，房间简洁干净又整齐，地理位置很方便有到市区和机场的轻轨，也有到市区的巴士而且收班收得很晚的。Nice stop in Beth's home. It's very clean and tidy. The most important is very convenient to go to downtown and airport.The first stop of USA makes me feel like home.Thank you Beth for your kindness.She even drive me to the Link station.
1750681,14487070,2014-06-20,16401031,Silvio,"Beth and her family were wonderful hosts! I barely spent any time at her house, since I was sleeping only 4 hours a night, but the little time I was there she was very courteous and hospitable. The room and the shared bathroom were kept very clean. Of course I tried to be clean and tidy as well. They were offering coffee and the use of their kitchen as well. I will not hesitate to reserve any of her cottages for my next trip to Seattle!"
1750681,14657200,2014-06-23,16784562,Janet,"Quiet stop in Seattle.   Bed was comfortable and room was clean.  I never met Beth but her Aunt DeDe waited up for me until midnight to show me to my room and was very kind and hospitable.
"
1750681,16747442,2014-08-01,18504010,Jenn,"Stayed at Ethiopian cottage for a few nights. Warm welcome from DeDe (Beth's aunt). Very nice blackberries to snack on from the bush in the backyard. Clean,secure,fluffy towels.
Thumbs up!
"
1750681,17294686,2014-08-10,7117893,Brittany,"Beth (and her aunt DeDe) were very generous and kind hosts. They went above and beyond to help me during my trip when I needed. When the bus broke down, DeDe even picked me up. 
I have stayed in Seattle several times at different places and Beth's is at the top of my list.
The home was so clean and quiet. It was exactly what I needed. As a student with a busy schedule I wanted somewhere clean, safe, drama-free to lay my head at night and it was exactly that. The room was nice and spacious with closet, across from the bathroom. 
The neighborhood was nice, too. It was very close to several bus routes (which I took everyday) and walking distance to light rail, which goes to the airport and/or downtown."
1750681,17534824,2014-08-13,8612775,Desi,"I enjoyed my stay with Beth and DD at the Ethiopian Cottage. I was greeted warmly by DD the evening I arrived, and both DD and Beth were so helpful with directions and very accommodating. The space was quiet, clean, and had a wonderful view. "
1750681,17605836,2014-08-14,17483693,Paulina,Beth is an incredibly sweet and warming host. She took me in on a last minute request and responded within few minutes. The room itself is clean and great space for the price. She offers full use of her house and suggested great running locations as I like making my morning runs. I didn't actually get to sleep in the room as I ended up enjoying Seattle night life till the early morning but would highly come again for the price. Location is a bit of distance from downtown but if you have a car it's completely doable. 
1750681,17783509,2014-08-17,16932328,Clifford,"beth's place is very clean, very homely! it is super convenient to get around seattle from where she is. she is extremely engaging to have a conversation with & i would love to stay with her the next time i go to seattle!"
1750681,18102119,2014-08-21,20244943,Rebecca,"The host made me feel very welcome--I had a hard time finding the place, and I called her and she was prompt to answer and stepped outside and waved me to her house, which was just a few houses down the road. She showed me around and was very warm and kind."
1750681,18201196,2014-08-23,16932328,Clifford,"beth's place is very clean, very homely! it is super convenient to get around seattle from where she is. she is extremely engaging to have a conversation with & i would love to stay with her the next time i go to seattle!"

1750681,18586041,2014-08-28,17937309,Ben,"I have no complaints! Beth was a wonderful host who took tons of extra steps to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable. 

The listing was just as described, and the photos reflect that well. On top of that,  the room I stayed in had maps and travel guides left by previous guests, which was a helpful surprise. The kitchen, common areas, and bathroom were all clean and orderly. 

The neighborhood is quiet and easy to maneuver. You might want to check it out on google maps to get a feel for the area and see if it's right for you. 

All in all a great experience. I was begging to stay longer, but this house and its rooms are a great value and fill up quickly!"
1750681,18714229,2014-08-31,388722,Jennifer,"Beth was wonderful about responding to my questions months in advance (I'm a planner!) and was very helpful (which I greatly appreciated).  And it turns out that we both love traveling, so we had a lot to chat about!  The room was perfect for my stay in Seattle."
1750681,18832778,2014-09-01,13008673,Anna,"She is really nice and kind. The room was very cozy and clean. I could use a lovely kitchen and washroom as well. Even though here is little bit far away from downtown, I'd like to go over again."
1750681,18933674,2014-09-02,8728506,Ben,Stayed here once before. Great Place!
1750681,19155588,2014-09-07,20369170,Craig,A small simple room in a clean home located a few hundred feet from the 7 bus that tajes you right downtown.  Beth is a dependable host who makes her home your home.
1750681,19292740,2014-09-09,12419760,Jessica,"I had a short stay- arrived about 8pm and had to leave for a conference first thing in morning, but host was friendly and accommodating. Room was as expected, clean and orderly. Very helpful and pleasant! "
1750681,19473863,2014-09-13,11456156,Jessica,We had a wonderful trip and Beth's home was the perfect place for us to call home for the few days we were there. We didn't have any trouble with transportation into and out of downtown Seattle and enjoyed the neighborhood! Beth was a lovely host!
1750681,19581210,2014-09-14,20631073,Jon,"If you're a traveling solo, want a homey place to stay and trying to save money on lodging, this is the place. Free wifi. Nice deck in the back. Not too far but still driving distance (or a bus ride away) from downtown. Part of me wanted to stay longer than one night to get to know the kind host, Beth. "
1750681,20189389,2014-09-25,19747470,Max,"Beth is an incredible host, generous, kind and a joy to have stayed with. The room and house in general are immaculately kept, the area easily navigable and only a short bus ride from the heart of town. I would unreservedly recommend staying here to anyone visiting Seattle!"
1750681,20271453,2014-09-26,8530582,Nicole,"My stay at Beth's place was really nice! She is very sweet, a good listener and very welcoming! Just a really nice and genuine person. My stay was short, but I felt very welcome and really happy to be there. Next time when i'm in Seattle, for a longer time, I would definitely go back to Beth's place!

The room is cozy, comfortabel bed, nice breakfast and everything is very clean! Good location as well.

Thanks Beth, for everything! Say hi to Didi for me;)"
1750681,20400377,2014-09-28,8838512,Sarah,"I loved staying at Beth's home!  It was a quiet house and while I didn't meet Beth, I did spend a bit of time talking with her aunt, Didi.  Didi was super friendly and a wonderful conversationalist.  She understood that I would be in and out very early and late for work, and had always prepared coffee and breakfast in the morning, as well as tea in the evening.  The room is simple but very comfortable, and the bathroom is right across the hall.  Loved staying here, I would definitely stay again!"
1750681,20843773,2014-10-06,20284053,Linda,"This was my second stay with Beth.  She is a wonderful hostess.  Her warmth and friendliness make you feel like you are staying with a good friend.  The home is neat and clean.  The location is very convenient. It is easy to reach from I-5,  shopping and are restaurants nearby, and it is very close to the light rail.  I recommend this B&B highly."
1750681,24386000,2014-12-27,7265223,Segun,"Beth was very friendly, accomodating and helpful. The place was comfortable and in a good location. I would stay here again."
1750681,24673156,2015-01-01,15585252,Liyin,Beth is a nice person. The room and the bathroom are cozy and clean. Highly recommend.
1750681,24895846,2015-01-03,25242959,Nerissa,"Beth was wonderful!  I felt so guilty because I didn't call to confirm my arrival until right before (I'm such a BnB noob, I didn't see the emails!  It won't happen again).  Beth was so wonderfully understanding an open. I like most anyone who has participated in Couchsurfing before, and Beth definitely has that air of someone who enjoys the company of like-minded travelers, and I felt very comfortable in her home.  Thank you!!"
1750681,25215115,2015-01-09,14938324,Rachel,Very comfortable room and Beth was so helpful and friendly. We spent our days house hunting but when we turned in for the night she always greeted up cheerfully. Would stay again if we weren't already moving to Seattle! 
1750681,26072069,2015-02-02,26385692,Paolo,"Everything was perfect! Quiet neighbourhood, comfy and clean room and Beth is very welcoming and helpful! Tea coffee and breakfast is a plus. 
I can totally recomend Beth and her house.
"
1750681,26546862,2015-02-15,9289634,Janice,"Beth was a great host and made sure I was able to get settled even though she was not present when I arrived. She was very good with communication via email/messages. The house itself was clean and comfortable, and I slept very well all three evenings I was there. Because of my schedule, I didn't have much interaction with Beth, but she was friendly every time I saw her.

I was in town for a conference in Rainier Valley and picked this location due to its proximity. I'm comfortable with walking and taking public transit, and both were completely fine even when coming back around 11PM one evening. The location is relatively close to a major transit line (5-minute walk to the 7 Line), and there is a large grocery store right there as well. It's a few miles away from the downtown, though, so it feels quite suburby and less city in Rainier Valley. You're also about a mile away from the Columbia City center, which has a nice little strip of restaurants, cafes and shops."
1750681,26756192,2015-02-18,27211416,Jackie,"I was very happy to stay in Beth's airbnb because it was right where I wanted to be in Seattle and Beth made me feel at home. When I spoke to her she explained how she got into the program and made me feel comfortable about being there.
I had the use of the living room, dinning room and kitchen if I wanted them."
1750681,27031551,2015-02-23,27855113,Jamie,"I would highly recommend Beth's flat to stay in. It is easy to get uni Seattle, the flat is lovely, Beth is very welcoming and it is great value for money.

Thanks you Beth. "
1750681,27778281,2015-03-11,25452120,Stian,"The place was great and Beth was very gracious and hospitable as host! She was available for questions, and the coffee in the morning was a good way to start off the day!

Groceries is a stones throw away, as well as some chain restaurants. Neighbourhood is diverse, 39th street nearby takes you to the upscale neighbourhood of Mount Baker, where there's a beautiful view of Mercer Island at the end.

Loved Seattle, and would love to stay here again next time!"
1750681,28399488,2015-03-23,27673019,Brian,"Beth was welcoming and made our stay enjoyable. The bedroom we stayed in was clean and Beth provided fresh towels and a clean bathroom. While we didn't spend much time in Beth's home apart from sleeping, Beth was friendly and helpful. We really appreciated the little basket of brochures of things to do in the area and local bus routes. Beth's home's location was close to the bus stop and the grocery store and that was incredibly convenient."
1750681,28590410,2015-03-26,5454799,Luke,"Beth was extremely nice and I gathered she was very wise from our brief conversations. The place was just as described and you can't beat the location for groceries, etc. Lots of food nearby. Would definitely stay there again if I was in the area."
1750681,28791574,2015-03-30,27075537,Naomi,"Beth is a very nice, welcoming lady. I would recommend her place to anyone. It was neat and clean, and close to the bus line. The wifi was great, and there was tea, coffee, and fruit every morning.  

The room was a bit small for two people, but for a weekend trip it worked just fine. The bed is good for a couple, but if you need space to sleep it was a little cramped. 

The bathroom was tiny, but the water pressure in the shower was good and there was hot water right away. The kitchen space was small but accommodating, fridge to store leftovers, microwave, toaster, electric kettle, and coffee maker. I did see a few ants running around on the counter, but not more than one each time and maybe about 4 or 5 times over 5 days.

I gave 4 stars for communication, there was a hiccup in the beginning that could have been solved with a simple text message. But once that issue was resolved everything was smooth sailing from there.

I would recommend booking with Beth  to anyone; good location, good accommodations, and friendly host."
1750681,29232451,2015-04-05,10096185,승혜," Beth's house is good!!we are really satisfied the home. Even though we couldn't see each other, Beth's sister and daughter were so kind~ Actually, I have something to advice! If you arrive at the house at night, you lost your way and can't find well!"
1750681,29781914,2015-04-12,30363384,Alyssa,"Beth made me feel so welcome in her home!  I wasn't around a ton, but she welcomed me every time I got to her house.  The neighborhood is so cute.  Really close to a grocery store and bus stop to get down town.  Room is just like she says!  I would recommend staying here!  "
1750681,30272556,2015-04-19,13080273,Vivian,I had a good stay with Beth. Everything was nice and she had some fruits and breakfast items in the morning. She was also easily reachable by text. Very hospitable host.
1750681,30510909,2015-04-23,3625741,Debra,"I enjoyed my stay at Beth's.  She is a lovely person, easy to talk to, and likes traveling & talking with travelers.  Beth's home is clean & quiet.  A couple of suggestions for Seattle: 
(1) If you have a chance, go to Lake Washington which is just east of 50th Ave.  There is a nice walking path along the lake and it is a beautiful, park-like setting to escape the traffic & freeways of the city.  
(2) to get downtown, it will be a much more enjoyable trip if you take the Light Rail instead of the bus.  You can catch the Light Rail at the Mount Baker Transit Center with is only a 10 - 15 minute walk from Beth's.  
I would stay with Beth again and highly recommend her home to any traveler.  "
1750681,31863766,2015-05-10,32715803,Diana,Beth and her family were very welcoming. The neighborhood was awesome and quiet and the description if the house was very acurated. I totally suggest Beth's house. 
1750681,32468281,2015-05-18,16896844,Dora,"Bethy's house is really cozy and comfortable. It is near to the Mt baker station(you can take No.7 bus to get there) ,which is a link light rail station you can get from the airport.Around the house,there are Safeway, Starbucks, Taco Bell and Ross dress for less,so it is really convenient.
And bethy's aunt, Dede, is really friendly,she even agreed to take us to the Mt.Rainier, although the weather is not good,we are really grateful to her.
What's more , we made friends with a girl who lived nextdoor.
In a word, it was really a great experience! Thanks!"
1750681,32916586,2015-05-23,28154136,Emiko,"Bethy's so lovely & sweet person! her family as well. She's friendly, down to earth and very hospitable host. Enjoyed talking about random stuff with her and I got so much energy from her. Thanks Bethy! :D 
Everything was 100% accurate as described, communication was great too. Very clean, comfortable, convenient to transportation/grocery stores, safe and quiet neighbors.  Fresh coffee was made every morning and that was beautiful.
I highly recomend her place! 

I just wonder,,, why isn't she a Super Host yet???"
1750681,33236980,2015-05-26,28097261,Elise,"What an amazing experience. 

Only briefly met Beth as she was away, but her Auntie DD looked after us like we were royalty. Thank you for the food, cultural and life lessons. They will be treasured for a long time. 

The house is lovely, and the amenities are great. Use the 7 bus to get to town! Safeway is 1 minute away by foot. 

Thank you, and will return next time in Seattle!!!

Elise xxx"
1750681,33736945,2015-05-31,10436273,Elizabeth,"Most comfortable bed ever! Bethy and her lovely Aunt Dede made me feel just like family during my stay in Seattle! Unfortunately, I was too busy with a  wedding to spend more time there, but the room, kitchen and guest bathroom are super clean and comfy - and they were kind enough to offer me driveway parking spot (plenty of street parking too!).  Bethy's wonderful home is a delight and i would highly recommend it! My friends in Seattle said the location was a bit far from downtown and the neighborhood was a bit rough...  but honestly, it really wasn't! Super cute and close to all - i will look forward to staying with Bethy and family in the future."
1750681,33822779,2015-06-01,30449908,Janis,"We stayed at Beth's place after ten weeks on the west coast and we had some packing to do before we flew out of Seattle. Beth's house is very bright and clean. The kitchen is great, there's coffee and all. It's only twenty minutes to the airport and a supermarket is close by. We loved it and would recommend it!"
1750681,33974377,2015-06-02,19076916,Gigi,"I really enjoyed staying at Beth's place. It was close to where I was going during my short stay. Her hospitality was warm and inviting. The stay was easy and convenient. Upon returning after dinner, she was visiting with the other guests in the main room. She offered me to join with a glass of wine. I felt welcomed and enjoyed the evening company before calling it a night. 

I appreciated the extra blankets in the closest as I forgot to dress warm for bed because I tend to get chilly easy. 

Initially, when I was researching my options, I was impressed with the high volume of feedback (positive) with her listing compared to other Airbnb's. After staying there, it's understanding. Thank you, Beth and DeeDee!"
1750681,34949603,2015-06-14,24780659,Scott,"Excellent accommodation, helpful host, thank you Beth."
1750681,35338882,2015-06-17,35150828,Yezenia,"Room was exactly as described, clean, organized and private. Beth is a wonderful host and lovely person to talk to. Her home is easily accessible from airport and to downtown Seattle, where you can then get to any part of Seattle by public transportation. I will highly recommend the stay with Beth and will use this listing again when I'm back in the area."
1750681,35409947,2015-06-18,26157845,Rena,"I felt very comfortable and welcome at Beth's, and the location was convenient, easy walking distance, to a event in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle."
1750681,35527901,2015-06-19,35956164,Elizabeth,"Beth truly welcomes guests to her home.  It was a comfortable room, and I appreciated the bottled water, tea, and coffee, and fruit and snacks she provided.  "
1750681,35686271,2015-06-21,8090828,Bobby,"Beth is a wonderful host. Friendly and welcoming, she made me feel at home since the moment I stepped inside her house. The room was clean and the bed was quite comfortable. The best part of my stay though was hanging out with Beth and one of the other guests.  
Also, the neighborhood was quiet and green. I walked back and forth from the train station at night  and did not feel unsafe at any point. "
1750681,35900231,2015-06-22,36374155,Glen,Fantastic place to stay while in the Seattle area. Room and bathroom were very clean. Beth's aunt welcomed me and really made me feel at home. Very convenient to get to and from via bus. Highly recommended.
1750681,36568322,2015-06-29,34696193,Aaron,"Beth is a very nice person. She offered everything u need. The place is also good, near to the Safeway and easy to catch the bus to the downtown. The room is also same as the picture shows, very comfortable. Highly recommend. Next time, I'll also stay there."
1750681,36830789,2015-07-01,36490042,Azalea,Awesome place! Thank you Beth for being so kind to open your nice home. Walking distance to the bus stop and Safeway. Would definitely recommend to a friend! 
1750681,37341990,2015-07-06,1879137,Gautam,"The host was helpful and kind to give us a pleasant welcome. When I called her upon reaching, she picked up and helped us enter. So she's available even when away. The room was a bit small but two people can still manage. The neighborhood is a 15 min drive from downtown. But it's not the best neighborhood. The restaurants are not of high quality (especially the Chinese place at the Safeway complex nearby). But in this cottage, I liked the books that Beth stacked up in the living room. Made me interested in visiting those places covered by those travelogues. Beth was kind enough to also lend a small amount of her refrigerator space to put our food and water. Plus, you can use Beth's coffee machine to make coffee for yourself."
1750681,37783301,2015-07-10,35557778,Donna,Bethy and her aunt made me feel very welcome.  The posting was 100% accurate.  The location is great; I felt very safe.  
1750681,38168359,2015-07-13,35632113,Elizabeth,"Beth was my first Airbnb host, and provided a great first experience for me. I did not get to meet Beth the first day. DD her Aunt was their to greet me with a very welcoming smile and  a tour of the home. She was easy to talk to and i enjoyed the warmth she gave to the home. Coffee and snacks available every morning. The house was very clean and tidy, it was quiet, the room was as described and exactly what i needed. The bed was very comfortable it felt like i was home."
1750681,40281448,2015-07-29,514063,Timm,Beth's a great host. There are a few rooms - the house had other travelers from Europe in another room. And it was nice to have someone to chat with. The house is clean and the room is exactly as described in the picture. Great communicate leading up to the visit. Thanks.
1750681,40806321,2015-08-02,5720045,Tim,"Beth was an amazing host! Very accommodating and very helpful in providing information about the area. The room was exactly as pictured and very comfortable. I would absolutely stay at Beth's again and would recommend her as a host to others as well.

Thanks so much Beth!"
1750681,41951863,2015-08-10,34990774,Mateo,Beth is a really nice person and the house is very comfy. I loved staying there and would definitely recommend this house to other people who are looking for a nice place to stay. Thx for accepting me for the stay

1750681,42933952,2015-08-16,36133825,Alix,"Beth and Deedee were excellent hosts. Ethiopia house was extremely peaceful, clean and welcoming. They provided every amenity that you would expect at a four star hotel. Except this is a lovely private home that is close enough to taxi downtown but tucked back from the madness of Seattle. It was a perfect respite. 

Beth, thank you for opening your home to me. I felt like I was home with my family. Keep on rocking in the new world, lady. And please give your aunt a hug for me."
1750681,43151471,2015-08-17,29192052,Venkatesh,"Beth was very welcoming, apart from initial hiccup due to communication lapse. She very kindly agreed to house my luggage even after I had checked out. She even drove me to my destination late in the evening on account of my luggage. "
1750681,43386273,2015-08-19,29833894,Mikaela,"Fantastic place to stay! Really easy to get around & close to a bunch of shops and food :) room was pretty hot, but there was air con and a fan. "

1750681,44405529,2015-08-26,8218211,Don And Karen,Bethy is a wonderful hostess and hearing her life story is an inspiration to all. This is the roomiest and most luxurious of the three rooms at the Ethiopian Cottage.  The bed is comfortable and the entire cottage is very clean.  I especially liked relaxing on the the patio out back
1750681,44726173,2015-08-28,7246007,Bijal,"I had a great stay with Beth. Though I was not able to see her often, I was able to briefly meet her. Beth is sweet and the house is very comfortable. The room was clean and I was able to relax after a long day's travel. The house is very close to the city. I had no trouble driving in and out of the downtown area. Overall, I had a wonderful experience!"
1750681,46275308,2015-09-09,36932002,Christian Plesner,"I stayed at Beth's place for two weeks and she was a great host the whole time, super friendly and helpful. The location was really convenient too, easy to get anywhere and near Safeway. I'd definitely like stay there again if I go back to Seattle."
1750681,46667527,2015-09-12,31279165,Will,Beth was an excellent host and everything was as described.  She and her aunt were both most friendly and interesting and also very helpful in describing Seattle and how to best use its public transportation. Her aunt even drove me and another visitor around for a half-hour to familiarize us with the area.  
1750681,47023383,2015-09-14,35900792,Aiyun,"Beth is a very kind host! The room is clean and quite, it was a comfortable experience in Seattle! "
1750681,47755718,2015-09-21,25115060,Kah Wai,"I spent a week in Beth's place and I wanted to stay another week but unfortunately for me, all her rooms were fully booked. 

The rooms were as advertised with bottled water, clean towels etc but my favourite feature was Beth's sensitivity. When I'm jet-lagged she will leave me to nap the day away and when I want to explore, she's full of ideas.

As I was leaving for another AirBnB, Beth's mother was so sweet to drive me there!

Thanks Beth & Didi for your kindness"
1750681,49019384,2015-09-30,39259204,Aniruddha,"On behalf of my parents: 
I am writing this review on behalf of my parents who are the one actually stayed in the place. 
""Very nice neighborhood with easy access to the number 7 bus to downtown. Conveniently located Safeway grocery store and Ross clothing store.  The host Bethy and her aunt Dede were the nicest people we met and we bonded very quickly, like we were family members. Dede was so helpful we are fortunate to have people like them living among us. Will be back soon, ameseginalehugn! ""  "
1750681,49534692,2015-10-04,9499899,Vitali,"Very cozy and light house with wonderful hostesses Beth and Dede. In the morning and in the evening you can always enjoy a hot drink, everything has always been prepared on a table in the dining room. It was nice to come back every night as a home. Thank you."
1750681,50684374,2015-10-13,42591584,Ellen,"TY Beth for the warm welcoming into your home!! ""home sweet home""! The room was perfect and relaxing! Great energy in this home! I will be back again! And TY DeDe for the tour of downtown Seattle! It was FUN! "

We had a lot of fun and her family is also very friendly and kind! I will never forget these days living with them! Wish the best!"
1750681,53731190,2015-11-11,40575112,Robert,"I had a long week of travel before arriving at Beth's and I could not have felt more welcomed.  Right away you know this is a caring home and you comfort and well-being will be looked after.  The location is perfect in that you are in a residential area, but only a two minute walk to a Safeway, laundry, and restaurants.  The #7 bus stop is also only a two minute walk and will bring you to Pike Street downtown in 20 minutes.  The room is comfortable and well supplied with extra blankets, plushy towels, and clean everything!  Coffee is made every morning and a big bowl of fruit is ever present.  The kitchen has everything you may need and Beth readily shares the common areas for cooking, dining, or just to watch TV.  Safe, privacy, and the warmth of people await you at the Ethiopian Cottage.

9156273,53290820,2015-11-07,47130255,Célia,"The room is just near the stop bus, in a very quiet place. We need only 20 min to go to downtown with the bus. Griffin and his two roomates are very friendly, fun and flexible ( we arrived at 12 pm in the house, without matter). We spend very great time with them talking, going out and they gived us some advise about Seattle. A really good and fun experience, and Seattle is really a city to go."
9156273,53718661,2015-11-11,11082794,Fiona,"My roommate and I stayed at Griffin's house for two nights. Both him and his roommate Charlie, were super friendly, and laid back. They gave us tons of suggestions on good places to go in the area. The house is super cute and cozy, and located in a very convenient area, everything was within walking distance. Overall we had a lovely stay! "
9156273,53774644,2015-11-12,10982476,Anne,"The neighbourhood is simply adorable. We had a great time with Griffin. Griffin is super nice, kind and friendly. I recommend this place: best place to crash after a late night in Seattle!"
9156273,55036720,2015-11-27,39967389,Takuya,His instruction about his house rule was so clear. He sent us the information what need to know beforehand so we could check in smoothly. 
9156273,55336706,2015-11-29,46423635,Tamara,Was awesome and accommodating. Griffin was perfect host.
9156273,55552403,2015-12-01,30934641,Courtney,"These gents were awesome hosts. Very chill group of guys who are open to hang out. For you runners, the house is within striking distance of one of Seattle's best parks."
5365612,28734818,2015-03-29,27077857,Timothy,"Jorge made us feel at home and was available via text and email, responding very quickly to our needs. The house was accurate to the description and didn't offer any surprises. "
5365612,39712420,2015-07-25,36112371,Yuki,"Unfortunately, I couldn't see Jorge, but everything was well prepared. The room is little tiny but very clean, the views from a balcony and a living room are beautiful. I drank beer seeing a night view!!
Access is also good both to downtown and SeaTac Airport."
5365612,41869442,2015-08-09,25904176,Anthony,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say that staying with Jorge was like staying with a good friend that I haven't seen in a long time. Jorge is a very warm and welcoming person, and from the get-go we were having great conversation about the city and many of its attractions. He is definitely an A+ host, and I would recommend anyone to book with him if they are looking for a mix of great hospitality and friendliness.

Now on to the details:

- Jorge was more than helpful with giving me directions from the airport to his place, as well as telling me step by step instructions on how to use all of the available public transportation methods Seattle has to offer. He also informed me of the Seattle culture and way of life, and made me aware of certain state laws that I did not know about (such as the recycling/compost/trash laws). Being my first time in Seattle, I was greatly appreciative of this level of detail. 

- When I arrived at his place, Jorge left out some welcoming gifts for me, which was totally unexpected and eased me into staying with him for the week. I don't know if other hosts are as welcoming as Jorge is, but he has really set the bar high on what I will come to expect from other Airbnb hosts.

- Jorge checked in with me daily to ensure that I was comfortable with my room, the bedding, the temperature, the bathroom and shower, and even went as far as to give me a personal tour of the city on my first night in. He was also really informative as to what kinds of activities I could get myself into throughout the city, and gave me lots of tips on what days and nights to check out particular hot spots.

- Jorge gave me access to make use of his kitchen, as well as the living room TV and the washer and dryer. Although I did not cook or wash anything during my stay, it was nice to know that those options were available to me. 

- When it was time to pack up and leave the city, Jorge was kind enough to drive me to the light rail station to help ensure that I got to the airport with enough time to catch my flight. 

I definitely feel fortunate and grateful that I got Jorge as my first Airbnb host. I would definitely book with him again if I need a place in Seattle. "
5365612,42369763,2015-08-12,29464281,Brooke,Jorge is a very welcoming host with a great place to offer to traveling guests! The bedroom and attached bathroom are very private and also cool in the hot summer months. I would definitely stay here again and I recommend Jorge's place to anyone visiting the Seattle area!
5365612,45023016,2015-08-30,9606640,Teki,"Jorge was an excellent host! His place is just how it looks in the pictures if not better! My room was set up nicely upon arrival; San Pellegrino and chocolate included :). Perfect accommodations for a solo traveller looking to lay their head. Great public transportation to and from the airport and downtown Seattle. Jorge provided some great recommendations for things to do in the area, some great coffee shops, museums, etc. I will definitely be staying with Jorge again, next time I'm in Seattle!"
3551668,17222119,2014-08-09,1567396,Rebecca,"We had a great time in Seattle largely in part to Scott's sweet little spot in the city! Firstly, he was incredibly kind and flexible when we accidentally arrived early and once we got settled we felt right at home. 
The space is warmly decorated, a perfect location to explore the happenings in Cap Hill (and a great springboard location for anywhere else in Seattle), we had clean sheets, fresh towels, a full kitchen (thank goodness), and a quiet seclusion because of his wonderful landscaping that is hard to achieve in the city. And a washer and dryer to boot!
Scott was incredibly easy to get in contact with although after arriving a tad early, we never needed to contact him again because the place was great. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here not only for the tranquil and comfortable space but for the location and ease of interaction with the host. Overall a wonderful visit and we would definitely stay here again. Thanks Scott!"
3551668,17455261,2014-08-12,7726925,Daniel,"The unit was definitely as advertised. Beautiful two bedroom with 2 bath unit. Immaculately updated and cleaned. Check in was extremely easy. The beds were out of this world soft. Water pressure in the showers was tremendous. Scott has done a great job of making sure his guests have a nice time while staying in unit A. 

The location is great for anyone staying in the heart of Seattle. Easy walking distance to all the major spots in Capitol Hill and public transportation down to all the tourist spots. Will definitely consider trying to book this unit for a future date. "
3551668,17949296,2014-08-19,11632859,Julianna,"Scott's place is great!
Very nice host and great central location."
3551668,18416680,2014-08-26,304651,Miles,"Scott was an amazing host, both he and his house were more than we could have asked for during our stay in Seattle!!  Scott was super responsive and helpful during the booking process and before arrival, and the house was exactly as described and pictured (very clean, comfortable, and functional!).  Not only was the house fantastic, but the location can't be (email hidden) place to explore Capital Hill and Seattle!

If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle, THIS IS IT!!!"
3551668,18578143,2014-08-28,12182726,Molly,"Had a great time during our 3 night stay!  Check in was easy, location was great, beds were very comfortable.   Would definitely stay here again if back in Seattle. "
3551668,18884347,2014-09-02,9791828,Kenny,"My friend and I really enjoyed our time at this residence.  Our host Scott was friendly & accommodating.  He provided some great local coffee as a welcome gift as well as clear/concise instructions upon arrival.  We also had a few questions during our stay and he was quick to respond.  The residence matched the pics in the profile perfectly.  The interior was clean, modern, spacious and private.  The neighborhood featured some excellent (walkable!) dining options & grocery stores.  We didn't have a bad meal during our stay (Poquitos was a particular highlight)!  If you're inclined, there's a nice park (Volunteer Park) & neighborhood (amazing houses!) due north to go for a run/walk.  Not to mention, an uber/taxi can have you down by the water within 15 minutes.  Would definitely stay here again during my next visit to Seattle."
3551668,19131843,2014-09-07,1169621,Rika,"As a former Seattle resident I knew their location would be very central and convenient, and given the photos and descriptions, our expectation was high.  But I have to say the place has even exceeded our expectation.  The unit was quiet, serene, extremely clean, stocked and comfortable. The host was beyond quick to respond to all our questions. They even let me ship a baby gear in advance. We went as a group of 3 adults and 1 baby, and we didn't feel cramped at all.  I would definitely choose to come back to this place during our next trip to Seattle."
3551668,19830500,2014-09-19,16684810,Terri,"Thank you Scott. The apartment is beautifully kept and I can think of nothing we missed. The coffee beans were a welcome surprise. As you can see we really enjoyed them. If you get this message twice I'm sorry. We are in the mountains and reception is intermittent. I have actually sent this once before. Your restaurant suggestions were well used. We ate at some of them plus more. Walked forever and felt very safe in all areas even though we were mostly wandering and exploring. Everything was within walking distance. However we bought transit tickets to get an overview of the city. Walking up Denny was a good workout!  Thank you for a clean, well equipped, and comfortable home. "
3551668,20093653,2014-09-23,10038482,Gerry,"We never got to meet or talk to Scott but we did talk with Ryan when we had a problem working the T.V which he helped us fix over the phone.
  The apartment was beautiful and in a perfect location for our needs.Everything is with in walking distance from Century ballroom which is the reason for our trip to Seattle.We were 4 people and the place was big enough for every ones sleeping needs.I would love to stay there again."
3551668,20561121,2014-10-01,3363587,Michael,"I truly wish I had more time to write this review, because Scott's place was absolute perfection. *So* happy I chose it! Peaceful, comfy, beautifully designed, and otherwise exactly as advertised/pictured and more. Such a good experience! Great communication, and zero complaints. Smooth as butter and highly recommended.  Hope to one day have the opportunity to return!"
3551668,21883785,2014-10-26,20236287,Arthur,"We had an excellent stay at this property. Scott was very helpful and the unit was perfect. Great location. Close to restaurants, shops and direct bus line downtown. The unit is spacious and we had plenty of room for the four of us. Would highly recommend the Urban oasis to anyone who wants to stay in a great location in Seattle. "
3551668,22655109,2014-11-11,3607202,Melissa,We had a girls weekend and had a great time! Scott was very available and responded quickly to any questions we had. Getting the apartment was swift and effortless. The place itself was very clean and in walking distance to everything we wanted and needed. It's a must stay place! When we come back to Seattle we will definitely be checking back in with Scott!!  Highly recommended.
3551668,23426470,2014-12-01,18219536,Joshua,"Great location and setup - perfect for hanging out and as a base of operations.  It's very convenient to Capital Hill, but in a quiet corner of the neighborhood.  The house is clean and comfortable, with a good kitchen setup where several people can organize meals together.  The host provides clear instructions and a list of local restaurants, stores, etc. and is very accessible if you have questions.  We would definitely stay here again."
3551668,26680819,2015-02-17,23356387,Bronwynn,"We had a wonderful stay!  The apartment was comfortable with everything we needed to feel right at home.  The best part was the location--we were just blocks from a park, dozens of restaurants, etc. but it felt so quiet and secluded when we got back to the apartment.  We will be back!"
3551668,27003564,2015-02-23,26967056,Rishi,This was a perfect experience. No issues at all. The place itself was very nice and Scott was a great host. All my questions were answered within minutes. The location of the house is ideal since it is located just a quick walk away from all the hustle and bustle of capitol hill. Definitely recommended. 
3551668,27554018,2015-03-07,28281505,Travis,My coworkers and I absolutely loved this place! Great location and just a few minutes from everything!
3551668,27769371,2015-03-11,11491445,Benta,"Great location. Fantastic unit A. Fully equipped kitchen, accommodated 4 for cooking. Thoughtful hosts provided clear details, emails with weather report and courtesy check-ins to see if everything was to our liking - absolutely was! COMFY beds, pillows, pillow tops made for restful nights. Absolutely WILL book again. Thank you for the relaxing getaway!"
3551668,30446604,2015-04-22,11650775,Lauren,The place was wonderful and in a great location! Very clean and set up perfectly for our group. Scott was helpful and very easy to reach via airbnb or the phone. Would definitely recommend staying here!
3551668,34573829,2015-06-09,29406081,Janelle,"Scott was there when we arrived to answer questions and show us the parking arrangement .  The unit was clean and beds comfortable.  We asked for fans to help with cooling and Scott was quick to bring over two.  The neighborhood was quiet but you should know there is a fire station on the corner that can have a call at any time.  Ear plugs were helpful for that reason.  The gardens, bamboo, and koi pond really help to make this an urban oasis. "
3551668,34898987,2015-06-13,2610322,Amber,"The ""hideaway"" was peaceful and beautiful, just like the photos and the beds were sleeping perfection. It's a quiet location but close to everything we needed. We walked to Pike Place Market, brought back fresh fruit and wine, then another day caught the monorail to the Space Needle and went through the Chihuly exhibit. We Ubered to the airport for $35 and back from dinner one night for $10. We will be back and will stay again at one of Scott's places. I highly recommend!!!"
3551668,38647678,2015-07-17,30556807,Kristin,"Scott was a very pleasant, responsive and accommodating host.  He graciously allowed us to drop our luggage off early (10am!) and even had the unit cleaned and available for us earlier than promised.  We really appreciated his flexibility.  The unit was very nice and very quiet - surprising, in a such a busy, bustling city.  We would definitely stay here again!"
3551668,39497430,2015-07-24,33777398,Kathryn,"Thank you so much for a wonderful place to stay in Seattle.  The Urban Oasis was perfect for our group of two couples.  Plenty of privacy and comfortable shared spaces to cook, eat, and relax after a day in the city.  You've done a great job with the property to create a real sense of ""oasis.""   The location worked out well for us; we mastered the buses pretty quickly and did not miss having a car.  Walking around the hills in Capitol Hill neighborhood was fun (and good exercise.)  We would be thrilled to stay here again next time we are out west."
3551668,40885243,2015-08-03,15767091,Angela,Scott was great! He made sure we had a great experience in Seattle :) The location was perfect. The house was beautiful. I would highly recommend.
3551668,41573561,2015-08-08,16296481,Tim,"An exceptional place! We (2 adults, 2 teenagers) stayed in both Unit A and then in Unit C. Unit A is on the ground floor with 2 large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (1 ensuite) and a very large kitchen/lounge area. Unit C has 2 larger bedrooms both with ensuite bathrooms and a smaller kitchen/lounge area. Both Units were immaculately clean, tastefully decorated and very well maintained. The beds are huge and very comfortable and there are some really lovely touches including coffee beans and a grinder and an iPhone5/6 charger (useful as we were using 1 power adapter for 5 devices). The washing machine and drier were useful for us as well. Capitol Hill, the city's coolest neighbourhood, is 30 minutes walk to Pike Place market, the Space Needle and the Seattle waterfront but also has great restaurants locally.

I recommend this 'urban oasis' 100%.

3551668,50760488,2015-10-14,42698151,Pat,"The listing was quite accurate.  The place was nice, clean and comfortable.  Scott was very accommodating and seemed very keen to make sure that our stay was nice."
3551668,51112452,2015-10-18,6459039,Lucie,"We had a great stay in this nice and well equiped apartement in capitol hill. Perfect for two couples! There are  a lot of restaurants and bars  around. Great and quick communication!
Highly recommended!"
3551668,51562912,2015-10-21,5786761,Rachael,Scott and Ryan's place was so cute and in such a great location! We had such a lovely time staying there. Everything was clean and tidy and the beds are super comfy! 
3551668,52343316,2015-10-28,26136325,Cosmo,"Scott was helpful and courteous by providing answers to most of my basic questions even before I asked them, and then patiently answering the others I still had. The neighborhood was exactly as described, and the house even better. Set inside a charming wooden gate and fence, surrounded by bamboo and other flora, it was the idyllic small town house experience with the convenience of a city location. 

The neighborhood is bustling just a block away, with many incredible restaurants and shops, but the house somehow remains nearly silent. This was great for me, as I'm a light sleeper. There's also a bus stop that takes you straight to downtown Seattle less than a block away.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone planning a visit to the Seattle area. One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had."
3551668,52975095,2015-11-03,5357454,Blake,"What an exceptional Airbnb! Great hosts, location, physical layout, amenities, and cleanliness. I absolutely recommend this spot and these wonderful hosts to other travelers. One tip: If you have a car, opt for the on-site parking because the neighborhood is dense (which is great because it's so walkable.)"
3551668,57751833,2015-12-29,5656569,Jerome,"This was an exceptional unit; clean, beautifully appointed, peaceful fenced koi garden in front yard and extremely comfortable beds.  Scott even provided a lovely lit Christmas tree and seasonal decor which made our holiday bright!  The living room had a very nice and comfy sectional so as to watch TV and the large dining table enabled us to play our family board games.  Thank you for a most enjoyable stay in Capitol Hill."
3551668,58183519,2016-01-01,50486130,Tracy,"We just experienced our first Airbnb ar Scott's very comfy apartment.  The location was perfect as our daughter lives nearby and we were within walking distance of many great restaurants and shops. As others mentioned, the bed is very comfortable as is the large sectional sofa.  The unit was very clean and well equipped, but we were disappointed there was no cork screw. Luckily, the Safeway is not too far. 

Don't miss Bakery Nouveau on 15th...a short walk with exceptional bread, pastries and more.

We slept well in the quiet bedroom and loved the Apple TV as well.  We will definitely book again next time we are in town."
8174389,48022388,2015-09-22,25348500,Marcus,it was a perfect spot for our guests and the appreciated the contact with you. We would come again. 
6557297,33558788,2015-05-29,21065501,Josh,"Shannon and Ben are easy going folks who made me feel very welcome in their home. Which is large, like a castle built into a hill. Room and bath are accurately described, bed was super comfy! In addition to receiving a delicious homemade cookie, I was invited for dinner and impromptu breakfast. Highly recommended. Most honorable mention: Muggsy the cat! "
6557297,33638686,2015-05-30,342635,Bir,"Comfortable, convenient place especially if you have to be close to the airport. There's an adorable cat. Shannon wasn't home, but her husband Ben was there to welcome and settle me in. Lovely host and we had a wonderful chat before I had to turn in for my morning flight."
6557297,34106678,2015-06-04,34706629,Chris,AmaIng hosts! Shannon and Ben made us feel right at home and even have us cookies! Also muggsy (the cat) is as friendly as can be. Would definitely recommend.
6557297,34184165,2015-06-05,26026761,Hyunjune,"Me and my girlfriend stayed just a night. Shannon and Ben welcome us even though we were late the check in time. It was 11pm... 
We really really really enjoyed and happy because the room is better than fancy hotel. And very important thing is people which is their personality. What can I say... Just they are great people!! 
"
6557297,34374020,2015-06-07,18388879,Jean,"Shannon & Ben welcomed us  with fresh baked cookies even tho we arrived quite late. Their hosting and travel experience were obvious as they were spot on for making it comfortable for us. Wish we could have stayed longer. Really nice, interesting people. Beautiful house, wonderful view of Lake Washington.  "
6557297,34602416,2015-06-09,5228412,Aggie,Shannon was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Her place is very accommodating and close to the lightrail which meant that we could leave the car to go explore the city more freely. The cat is lovely too!
6557297,34742184,2015-06-11,34706629,Chris,"Shannon and Ben were amazing hosts. They welcomed me with open arms into their home. Along with their adorable cat Muggsy, they made our stay in Seattle comforting and awesome. I would definitely recommend others to stay with Shannon and Ben as well as bring my business to them again anytime I return to Seattle."
6557297,35006204,2015-06-14,34522728,Abbi,"Very welcoming and lovely couple. Close by to supermarket,restaurants and a nice walking trail. "
6557297,35149894,2015-06-15,1499274,Rachael,"Shannon and Ben were excellent, accommodating hosts. My friend and I had a wonderful short stay with them, and they were very helpful in giving us recommendations for nightlife and helping us feel at home in a new city. Their home is lovely, the bed was comfortable and we enjoyed cereal on their balcony before setting off. Definitely encourage others to stay with them."
6557297,38298322,2015-07-14,16783560,April,"Shannon and her husband were out of town during our visit, but we did meet her husband on our last day. He was super nice and respectful. We had everything we needed and more. The patio was such a nice touch for evening wind down. Thanks so much for everything! P.s. fell in love with their sweet kitty :)"
6557297,38607093,2015-07-17,31226201,Julia,"I stayed in Seattle for 2 Nights for sightseeing during my Roadtrip. As i had a discribtion how to get to Shannon's house it wasn't difficult to find. Shannon was super nice and had a big smile in her face when she opened the door. I felt like coming home, really comfortable and welcome. The room was clean and comfi, i had a hugh bed, a table and a bathroom just for me. Shannon also prepared some prospects and a map so i was able to prepare my sightseeing trip for the next two days. I was positive surprised by Shannon and also her house and my accomodation. Thank you for that Shannon."
6557297,39065725,2015-07-20,37183762,Ruth,The hosts made our arrival easy and the house was clean and comfortable.
6557297,39700971,2015-07-25,7849200,Jessie,"My stay here was great. Easy location to get to, and very friendly hosts. The room had everything I could need as well. Highly recommend. "
6557297,39819160,2015-07-26,37696338,Semiotic,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it worked out great for us.  We stayed one night in order to be in walking distance from friends we were visiting.  We came back late and were easily able to access the room without disturbing anyone.  The hosts were friendly and helpful.  

I highly recommend checking out the Japanese Garden in the neighborhood if you stay here."
6557297,39953412,2015-07-27,8755096,Perrine,"We arrived late and left the following morning so we didn't really get know Shannon but she seems friendly enough and was definitely very easy to get in touch with.
The room itself is ok and so is the bathroom which has everything you may need and more. Both could do with a little dusting though.
Finally be warned that the house is within walking distance of a link light rail station but up a fairly steep hill so probably not the best option if you're wheeling a lot of luggage.
Overall a pleasant airbnb experience."
6557297,40821871,2015-08-02,38586350,Ulrike,Nette Unterkunft! Die Gastgeber waren freundlich und unkomplizirt. Wir hatten eine gute Nacht!
6557297,42153568,2015-08-11,37362727,Adam,"Wonderful room and wonderful people hosting said room. Everything was clean and our needs were well attained. Extremely good for the price, Shannon and Ben were very nice people as well.

Their cat Mugsy was very friendly and a joy to be around too. 

Thanks for the experience guys!"
6557297,42757666,2015-08-15,39971025,Mu,"It was my first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic! The hosts, Shannon and Ben, are helpful and friendly. We enjoyed everything that they provided. The location is near Rainier Beach Station, which is convenient to downtown area. Ben even gave us a free ride to the airport at the last day. Thank you Shannon and Ben, you two rock!"
6557297,44145824,2015-08-24,1628089,Fabien,"My girlfriend and I are from San Diego and we were traveling back from Alaska (1 week vacation). We were looking for a quiet place in Seattle to spend the weekend (instead of doing a 2 hours layover at the airport). 

Shannon was very nice and flexible. She gave us clear directions and it was very easy to get to the place from the airport through the trolley (we didn't rent a car for this weekend). She was out of town this week end.

It was our first time with only a ""private room"". Usually, we book a whole place. The others guests were pretty loud and not really considerate so we ended up leaving to spend the 2nd night in a hotel downtown. That was not a good experience but I will not put that on our host, I guess that's part of what can happen when you share a place. I feel it would have been easier if Shannon was there to talk to them. The others guest were 6 young guys, pretty drunk. I just didn't think a calm and constructive discussion with me would have led us anywhere. So we just left . 

We paid for the two nights of course. "
6557297,44647999,2015-08-28,14469743,The,"It was such a relief to get to this oasis the night we arrived.  We had a long day of traveling the day before and a flight to catch the following day.  We were so thankful to have the friendly welcome and the wonderful hospitality that they showed.  Our only regret is that our schedule and tired bones prevented us from meeting these lovely people.  We would highly recommend this spot to any traveler, and would welcome these two in New York should they ever need a calm in there traveling storm.  "
6557297,49496316,2015-10-04,43035975,Misha,"The best thing that has happened to us was the place where we have been staying. Surrounded by trees, lake Washington and beautiful parks made our Seattle experience unforgettable!"
2536507,11310757,2014-03-29,9171798,Kristen,"Marian was such a wonderful host, she was prompt with correspondence and very friendly. The Beach House that we stayed in was more of a studio apartment, which we thought might be the case, and it was wonderful, great views of West Seattle and within walking distance of fabulous restaurants. 

Parking on the hill was kinda tricky but other than that we had a great time and next time we visit Seattle Marian will be our first choice."
2536507,11377841,2014-03-31,13357261,Jesse,Thank you for the wonderful stay. The view was spectacular and your generous advice about where to go out made our stay very comfortable. Your accommodations were exactly as represented online. The service you provided makes all the difference in the world and is why we continuously come back to Airbnb. We look forward to staying with you next time we are in Seattle.
2536507,12229063,2014-04-26,1416606,Zac,"I would happily stay in Marian's studio again. This was a fantastic alternative to a hotel and, as I travel to Seattle often, I will certainly be staying here're again if I can. (4.5 / 5)
Thanks! See you again soon."
2536507,13054086,2014-05-18,7966452,Osama (Sam),"If you want to experience the taste of west coast living, Marian's place would be awesome choice. We found her studio cozy, peaceful, and very relaxing. Loved her decorate and colors choices as well. You really want also to walk in west seattle (the best area in Seattle my opinion). Marian's is available if you need an advice or had a problem. I d highly recommend the place for future stay. "
2536507,13701108,2014-06-02,4601513,Noah,"We had an amazing experience at Marian's studio. The space was pristine and well-designed and the view was fantastic. Marian was super communicative which made getting there a breeze. The space isn't *right* on the water, but it's an easy downhill walk a block or two to get to the beach. We loved the Alki Beach area and it was also super easy to get to other parts of Seattle."
2536507,14690126,2014-06-24,1962688,Pam,"Marian was the perfect host! She was in contact with us before, during, and after our stay; always ready to be of help. The apartment was just right for the two of us, with a comfortable bed and a great shower which, along with Marian providing a bottle of wine, toiletries, and food in the frig, made us feel right at home. The bus stop at the bottom of the hill made it easy to catch a bus to the water taxi or to downtown Seattle, but it was also a short walk along Alki Beach to the restaurants and coffee. Our favorite part, though, was sitting on the patio watching the sun go down behind the mountains as the ferry boats sailed across the Sound - absolutely beautiful and a great way to end the day! We highly recommend Marian's place, especially if you are staying in West Seattle."
2536507,14841189,2014-06-27,8167343,Amanda,"Very clean, well-appointed, private space, with beautiful & peaceful views of the water. We were traveling for work, but with dinner on the porch while watching the sun set over the mountains, it felt like vacation! Marian was very easy to communicate with, and the door code makes it easy to check in/out and come and go.  "
2536507,14866997,2014-06-28,13553150,Yue,"My mom and I had spent a wonderful day in Marian's house. If u wanna find a cozy and private place which also has an amazing ocean view, here will definitely be ur first choice.！！很棒的地方！！

2536507,15204157,2014-07-04,10911316,Tawni,Gorgeous view! Relaxing getaway spot. Comfortable and clean. It was nice to have a care basket. There were actually a few things I had forgotten and were provided. I would definitely recommend this stay.
2536507,15752678,2014-07-15,12930488,Kirk,"Marian and the studio were lovely. She was always very quick to respond from the initial booking all the way to while we were in Seattle. There were a lot of little things that made our stay enjoyable: a bottle of wine waiting for us, slippers, handmade soap, a binder full of answers/things to do. They also had a keyless entry so we didn't have to worry about losing keys.  Initially I thought maybe we were too far out from DT Seattle, but the location ended up being perfect for us, just a 5 min walk from the beach. I'd stay again. "
2536507,16085982,2014-07-22,15893150,Bob,"We truly enjoyed staying in Marian's studio. After a busy day exploring Seattle, most fun to come back to the beach and sit on the porch with a glass of wine. Such a theatre before us to absorb. Easy access via the water taxi into the city. Salty's a fun eatery. Enjoyed walking the beach. 

Apartment was clean and pretty much all we needed. Lovely retreat."

2536507,16344931,2014-07-26,15616467,Laura,"Marian is a wonderful host! Very detailed descriptions of what to do, where to eat and schedules of water taxi was much appreciated. The basket of wine and even little items of toothbrushes was very thoughtful (I had forgotten my toothbrush). The room and bath were very clean and the small refrigerator was packed with soda, water and even yogurt.  She even thought to include umbrellas for our unexpected Seattle downpours!   Most gorgeous view and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend this private romantic oasis and it was a most pleasant surprise for my boyfriend :)
"
2536507,16561015,2014-07-29,13307531,Stephen,"We Enjoyed Marians Studio very much and it was just as advertised. Marian was very helpful and responsive when it came to questions about getting around and seeing the sights.

The studio was nice and clean and perfect - just a 5 minute walk down the road to the beach. We were very pleased with the studio.

The location on Alki beach was beautiful and quiet. However getting to downtown Seattle requires some coordination including bus to water taxi which only ran once per hour on the weekends. I would recommend renting a car if you plan to really venture out quite a bit.

All in all I would give Marian's place 5 stars. We had a great time."
2536507,18676950,2014-08-30,4943515,Tamara,Marian's beachfront studio is the perfect alternative for those who want all the amenities of a hotel but who also want to experience a different side of Seattle. The views were stunning and the studio was very clean. I was very happy to stay there and I would be happy to return.
2536507,19282883,2014-09-09,20086122,Brett,"Marian was a great host! We were sad that we could not meet each other due to conflicting schedules. The description of the room and neighborhood were spot on. Very clean, private, and accessible to Alki Beach (just a 3 minute walk away) as well as a hop away from downtown Seattle if you rent a car. We never did take the water taxi, but I'd imagine that's a cool experience and quick as well. Not to mention the bottle of wine upon arrival! Thank you, again! "
2536507,20620664,2014-10-02,13347123,Tristan,"While we only met briefly, Marion was a very warm and welcoming host.  The studio was lovely, perfect for our brief stay.  Quiet, beautiful neighborhood, very easy to get downtown via the water taxi or driving.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!  "
2536507,20919345,2014-10-07,19007248,Rick,"The studio was just as Marion described and her communication was excellent, hassle free. It is clean, sleek and modern and well appointed. Location to the beach is awesome, easy walk - mind the hill!
Views of the Sound and Olympics are ideal for sunsets. If it is cold/cool weather note that the radiant heat in the concrete floor takes a long time to heat the room. We were excited to be there and took off to the beach after unloading, and should have taken a moment to bump up the heat first. If you are looking for an awesome place to stay in West Seattle, you have found it - look no more!"

2536507,21217075,2014-10-13,20764863,Tina,Marian's place is beautiful. Loved the decor. Loved the privacy. It was well furnished and well stocked with everything we needed to stay three nights. The view and the neighborhood awesome. If you are driving to West Seattle for the first time definitely drive in the daylight as some  of  the streets  were tricky. We  used to water taxi to visit  downtown Seattle twice and it was so convenient.  There were lots of Seahawks fans on there on game day. Alki Beach is also a very nice waterfront to stroll on and lots of people are there. I would love to stay at Marian's place again and would highly recommend it.
2536507,21305590,2014-10-14,17784113,Richard,"Convenient location away from the city.  Room was modern, clean, and well kept.  Parking was easy to find and in a safe area.  "
2536507,21749965,2014-10-23,10891336,Amanda,"Marian's studio was the perfect place for our brief stay in Seattle. The room was well-appointed, and we were greeted with a very thoughtful welcome basket. The view from our window was incredible! The water taxi made traveling to downtown very easy and fun. Overall, the studio is a very affordable and comfortable option-- I'd recommend it to anyone looking to avoid the hustle and prices of downtown. "
2536507,21891971,2014-10-26,1178026,Rachel,"Marian is the BEST. She was there to greet us when we arrived and show us the around the studio. She went above and beyond to leave a welcome basket and even slippers for us to use (they came in handy!). The listing is spot on, looks and feels exactly like the photos. Perfect location for us - it was removed from the city but still very accessible. We will definitely stay again is we return to Seattle. It was the perfect place to call home while we were on vacation."
2536507,22307044,2014-11-03,2093273,Chris,"We had a wonderful stay at Marian's beach studio and really enjoyed Alki Beach and the amazing views from our window. The beach studio is quiet and clean with perfect welcoming touches like new slippers, wine and toothbrushes. Highly recommend staying with Marian and taking advantage of exploring West Seattle. "

2536507,22933885,2014-11-17,21580308,Justin,Marian was an amazing host. The location was easy to find and had one of the most beautiful views ever!  Check in was easy and everything was up to or above expectations!

2536507,23682450,2014-12-08,19202464,Wayne,Marian was a great host. She made an effort to see us and make sure everything was set for us. The location is great with a fantastic view right outside. Street parking was easy to find and not too far from getting to downtown. 
2536507,23951296,2014-12-15,12433805,Rebecca,"Marian was an excellent host and made the whole process seamless. Lots of attention to detail gave it a special touch, from the assortment of complimentary teas and coffees, to the toiletries like extra tooth brushes and other items we tend to forget when packing! The room had everything we needed and the location near Alki beach and its restaurants and cafes was ideal. The unit was quiet, cozy and private. Would definitely stay again!"
2536507,24065259,2014-12-18,3771032,Tom,"What a fantastic studio...beautiful, clean and modern, and in a part of Seattle I'm sure I would never have discovered had I not stayed here. Marian's correspondence was through, friendly and professional and her welcome amenities left for my arrival were wonderful. If I didn't know better, I'd say Marian has a background in hotel management. A definite recommend!"
2536507,24148891,2014-12-21,6433755,Feng Yi,"We loved every bit of our stay at Marian and Jone's place. From a lovely welcome basket containing everything from amenities to even a bottle of wine, to the detailed homemade guidebook that provided great tips for sightseeing and transport around Seattle... to the umbrellas thoughtfully provided (in anticipation of Seattle's rainy weather). Marian checked in on us midway to ensure that everything was fine. We are sorry we didn't get to meet her in person, but our stay was perfect and we are very appreciative! "
2536507,24246446,2014-12-23,24681087,Melody,"My husband and I wanted a one-night local getaway, and Marian's place was perfect! We were greeted by Marian, who was so welcoming and friendly, just like she'd been in her emails leading up to our stay. The studio was modern and cozy and the perfect size for the two of us. We especially loved how close it was to the waterfront (great for walking/running!) and restaurants. We're from Seattle and are familiar with the area, but if we weren't, Marian's binder full of local information would have been extremely helpful. She definitely thought of everything for her guests! Thanks for a great experience, Marian!"
2536507,24310427,2014-12-25,6807430,Lynn And Tim,"I rented this space for my parents and did the walk thru with them... I was blown away by the awesome location, beautiful studio, and breathtaking view!  Although we did not meet Marian personally, she greeted us via email and let us know she would be there to help if we needed anything.

It rained almost the whole time my parents stayed at the studio, but that did not dampen their visit.  They drank coffee on the covered patio, used the umbrella's that Marian provided to walk the beach, and enjoyed wine in their space looking out the windows at the sound.

Would definitely rent again for ourselves or future guests!"
2536507,25237804,2015-01-10,24384174,Katie,"Amazing little studio just close enough to downtown and most places my mother and I went without being swept up among  all the traffic and people. Great neighborhood and area of the city, and Marian made our stay fantastic. She was so kind and made us feel welcomed. Amazing experience and would love to come visit again. Thanks again Marian! "

Not only did Marian provide us with a beautiful hip place to stay, she made sure we understood the area down to a google map of where to park (ample and close by).  We felt at home immidiately, the bed was comfortable and pristine ( I almost felt bad climbing in ha)  The view was incredible. she even thought to put comfy chairs outside to sit and watch the boats, birds and clouds drift by.    As a business owner I was VERY impressed with her customer service.  You won't regret this spot we are already planning another trip back later this year. "
2536507,25979357,2015-01-31,258822,David,Marian is a terrific host! Great communication and wonderful apartment

2536507,26061075,2015-02-02,19968203,Helena,My boyfriend and I had an absolutely lovely stay at Marian's home. Unfortunately we did not get the chance to meet Marian in person but she was incredibly helpful with all of the questions I had. The room was clean and beautiful and looked just like the pictures. Would definitely recommend staying here! 
2536507,26276009,2015-02-08,26975084,Erica,"We had a great time in Marian's studio!  
The location is excellent - close enough to walk to the beach and to shops and restaurants. It's a quick drive into downtown, too.  
The studio was exactly as pictured.  It's stylishly appointed, very clean, and has everything to make for a comfortable stay.  
Highly recommend!  "
2536507,26488633,2015-02-14,1345515,Lynn,"I was delighted to find this studio since I live nearby and wanted to share the incredible views and friendly neighborhood with visiting family members.  They appreciated the privacy, the spaciousness, and the bottle of wine.  It's a steep walk down the hill, but they were able to manage it just fine.  Marian responded to all my queries quickly and answered any questions I had.  "
2536507,26542588,2015-02-15,25504704,Corey,Marian provided a wonderful first Airbnb experience.  The room was very simple but modern.  The bed was very comfortable and the view was top notch.  Quiet hilly neighborhood within walking distance to the beach and many little restaurants and cafes.  I recommend this studio as well as Airbnbing with Marian!  She was always quick in her responses and gave clear instructions.  She made it very easy for us to enjoy ourselves.

2536507,27005138,2015-02-23,16595155,Sven,Had a fantastic time at Marian's beach house. Waking up and turning your head to see the sea and the mountains from your bed was just marvellous. Always again!
2536507,27322673,2015-03-02,25583414,Mary Kay,"We have been looking for some time in West Seattle for a modern, up to date spot to stay, as our daughter and family now live there. Marian C's studio with bedroom and bath was perfect. We are usually not B& B folks, preferring our privacy, again, Marian's unit, with private separate entrance offered a feeling of staying in our own private spot. Parking can be an issue, but not one that would keep us from returning again and again. Finally, the view is amazing. 
"
2536507,27633009,2015-03-08,15215467,Dave,"We really enjoyed our stay at Marian's place. The room was modern, exceptionally clean and stocked with useful things for a short stay like shampoo and teabags. The room has a separate entrance and feels completely private too. Marian is friendly and welcoming, and even gave us a discount for the minor inconvenience of our checkin being delayed by 10 minutes due to some repair work being finished.

Everything about the stay was awesome, there's a great view from the window and if you want to walk up the road for a few minutes you can see the Seattle skyline from Hamilton Viewpoint Park.

Easily 5 stars!"
2536507,28603368,2015-03-27,22300574,Brit,Marian was a great host!  The place was clean and the views were amazing. In my opinion Alki beach is one of the coolest places in Seattle.  I would love to return some day!
2536507,28786741,2015-03-30,3293309,Duy,Had a wonderful time at Marian's beach house. The view each morning was breathtaking and Marian was very responsive to any inquiries I had. She even went out of her way to help me procure some lovely Macarons for my wife. A completely pleasurable stay and would love to visit again. Can't recommend highly enough. 
2536507,28915531,2015-03-31,21580308,Justin,Marian was a great host yet again. Amazing communication and a super clean space.  It couldn't have been a better stay!  The location is awesome and close enough to the beach to take a walk down to enjoy the beautiful views and awesome shops and restaurants!
2536507,28997333,2015-04-02,2147903,Lisa,"Marian was very helpful, even before arrival, by providing us with recommendations of things to do in the area. The space is modern and clean and was perfect for our short stay. It has a very pretty view of the beach from the space. Loved that there was soap, water bottles, toothbrushes, among other amenities for travelers! "
2536507,29180799,2015-04-05,28162729,Salvador,Not only was this my wife and I's first time using airbnb but also visiting Seattle. We were not sure what to expect Lucky Marian made our first experience a excellent one. Although we did not meet Marian due to us arriving late I did speak with her a few times on the phone. She made sure everything was going ok with our stay. Her studio was very clean and the views were amazing. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Alki beach area. 
2536507,29574718,2015-04-09,842096,Lauren,"The studio in West Seattle was absolutely perfect - great location, amazing views, and great host. Marian has provided a ton of amenities within the little studio, which made our last few days on our trip very easy-going and relaxing. We highly suggest checking out La Rustica and Cactus if you stay here. Thanks, again, Marian!"
2536507,29828329,2015-04-13,932864,John,"I loved this place! One block walk to the charming community of Alki Beach.  There is a great paved path along the beach that I took for a spectacular seven-mile run that provided a majestic view of the mountains and downtown skyline.  There are a handful of bars, restaurants and coffee shops in Alki that are more than adequate.  And the California Avenue strip of more upscale restaurants is a short jaunt away.  The unit itself is quiet, clean, modern and has a nice view of the water.  Marian made the entire process seamless.  All in all, a great option for a Seattle getaway."
2536507,30009628,2015-04-15,5786616,Marley,"The space was clean, clear and beautiful. "
2536507,30381369,2015-04-21,4556756,Jordan,"Amazing place for a getaway in West Seattle! It was our first visit to the Seattle area, and I can't imagine a more perfect place to stay. Marian was very accommodating, allowing us to leave our bags in a safe location as we arrived before the checkout time. She was there to greet us when we arrived, and offered up plenty of recommendations for things to do in the area & downtown.

Alki beach is very short walk, providing some great views. Getting downtown was also an easy 10-15 minute drive. We decided not to rent a car, so we used uber, which was fairly reliable in getting us around. The water taxi is also short walk away and another great way to get downtown.

It was great to come back from a long day downtown, and enjoy the spectacular susnet views off the porch of the studio. The room was beautiful, and had everything we needed for 2 people. I was worried about staying so far from downtown, but it was easy to get around and we greatly enjoyed the quiet natural scenery surrounding their home.

We can't wait to come back!"
2536507,30678039,2015-04-26,20586778,Ashley,"Marian was kind enough to meet us upon our arrival and show us around the studio-which was both helpful & so nice to meet the hostess. 

Waking up to the sound of waves crashing & the sun rising was so peaceful and really made us feel completely relaxed. 

The binder that was left for us covered everything from great food to directions regarding the water taxi (which we highly suggest if you have time!) We woke up each morning to sit on the patio and sip our coffee & plan the days adventures. 

It was such a wonderful stay and we can't thank Marian enough for the perfect getaway. I wish we never had to leave. "
2536507,30775569,2015-04-27,20586778,Ashley,"Please see my review above :) we decided to add on one extra night...we just couldn't get enough. 

Wish we were there right now! "
2536507,31141997,2015-05-02,29072828,Tyler,"Marian was attentive to my itinerary, made herself available during my stay (thanks again for the toothpaste), and overall a fantastic hostess!  The home is absolutely gorgeous, modern and private.  The beach is a stone's throw from the studio with lots of local conveniences.   I'd stay here again in a heart-beat!"
2536507,31453200,2015-05-05,14819003,Faith,"Excellent place to stay, private entry with motion security lighting.  Thoughtful and accommodating host.  Quiet, clean, contemporary,  if you like ""DWELL"" magazine you will love this space!  A nice 15 min walk to dining and coffee if you should choose a morning walk. "
2536507,31952300,2015-05-12,500076,Adam,"Nice quiet neighborhood, great view of the water, sky, and coastline; about a 15 min drive to downtown except during morning or other peak traffic time.  Great place to stay, street parking is not a problem."
2536507,32706386,2015-05-20,32100740,Christina,"The studio is perfectly located within a quick stroll to the beach or restaurants. I loved how quiet it was, yet close enough to the water to hear waves at night while we slept. We used plenty of the amenities including the Roku box, wireless internet, coffee pots and guest basket and still left so many untouched because of how much was available to us. It was a breeze to come and go and I love that no key was required for entry (one more thing to worry about losing on vacation). Marian was very quick to respond to a couple questions I had during our stay. "
2536507,32873704,2015-05-22,7811123,Megan,"This studio was perfect for my short stay and I wish I could have found a few more days in Seattle to spend enjoying the view and the beach.  Everything was spotless and the room is decorated in a minimal, serene style. Check in is smooth and the hosts are incredibly responsive.  Great shower and very comfortable bed. I hope to stay here next time I'm in the area.  "
2536507,33413320,2015-05-27,301323,Amy,"Marian was very accommodating when I overslept and needed to check out late-- Thank you!  The studio is cozy, quiet, and situated in one of the best neighborhoods in West Seattle.  Miss that view!"
2536507,33595556,2015-05-30,4461053,Allen,The host was amazing and extremely welcoming.  The view.  Nothing else to say. 
2536507,33922303,2015-06-02,15893688,Chrystin,"This place is breathtaking!! The photos don't do it justice. Everything was absolutely perfect. Marian went above and beyond, responding right away to any questions and offering great recommendations. Alki beach is such a peaceful, fun, and gorgeous area, and it was really neat to take the ferry to and from the city. Waking up to the water and mountains in the morning was divine. I can't imagine staying anywhere else--what a treasure! Thank you, Marian and Jone for a flawless stay!"
2536507,34276357,2015-06-07,23337071,Josh,"Can't say enough good things about Marian as well as the rental unit itself.  The property is well maintained and has a great view and is so close to the beach (where we spent most of our time).  Marian was a great host, she made a great effort to ensure she greeted us and gave us alot of info about the surrounding area.  Even with her family living above the unit, it didn't disturb us one little bit and she made herself available to help us at anytime.  I highly recommend considering renting this unit if visiting Seattle.  It is so easy to get downtown via Water Taxi or Uber and the beach location is great!  Thanks Marian!"
2536507,34637653,2015-06-10,13700966,Akhil,"This was an amazing property to stay out. Less than a mile from the beach and bedroom view of the open water was extremely peaceful. The room was a simple but well maintained studio. Uber drivers have a little trouble finding it due to the area and roads but you will know it when you see it due to its distinct architecture and color. The area of Alki beach was calm and relaxed during the day, although it had some younger nightlife in the evening. The shuttle stop is close by and free to the water taxi, which costs $4/person, but takes you directly into the city in less than 10 mins. Everyone in the area is very nice and Marian was extremely helpful and responsive to inquiries. Would stay here again when I go back to Seattle. "
2536507,34756826,2015-06-11,33251201,Tom,Everything was perfect. Marian was great 
2536507,35131323,2015-06-15,34212884,Erik,The place was great! The host was welcoming and quick to reply to emails or questions. It was a nice little studio with a great view of the water. The location was great - just a quick walk to the beach and restaurant area of Alki. The room and neighborhood were quiet at night so no troubles with sleeping or being kept awake.
2536507,35439881,2015-06-18,35874985,Derik,"What a way to splash into the world of Airbnb!  My first experience and let me tell yA, this place is awesome!!  Super clean and modern..  Views are stunning.. Looking out at the sunset over the water from the comfy bed is hard to beat! Wonderfully private and quiet..  Easy to get to by public transpo or renta car..  I took the water taxi back into Seattle and it was so easy and scenic!  And to make the trip even better, Marian couldn't have been a more helpful or gracious host.. She was incredibly prompt, thoughtful and sweet in all of our correspondence. And even nicer in person.  The only place I want to stay from now on when I'm back to Seattle..  Book it!  "
2536507,36039785,2015-06-24,31184787,Harriet,"A great area to be in - off the beaten path and gorgeous.  Too bad we only had a one-nite stay.  Studio was perfect with a great view of the water.  Marian's communications were clear, precise and complete.  Everything was just as stated.  "
2536507,36312626,2015-06-27,19148857,Mark,Wow what a view! A beautiful bijoux studio with everything you could need and more. Marian was a lively host.

2536507,37613456,2015-07-08,32989633,Chloe,"Felt right at home! The location was perfect, quick walk to the beach before my boyfriend and I left. Marian even accommodated me due to time conflicts, which I extremely appreciate still! Definitely coming back to this studio in the future :)"
2536507,37879385,2015-07-11,30124446,Casey,"Marian was a wonderful host! Her place was exactly as described and she gave lots of great recommendations for places around the area. We were heading to Vancouver after our stay there and she gave even more suggestions for there as well. It's such a beautiful spot and close walk to everything, but we just enjoyed sitting on the porch drinking some wine (that she provided) and enjoying the beautiful views and weather!  We will definitely stay there again!"
2536507,38547116,2015-07-16,34248437,Yasir,Everything is nice overall.
2536507,38746544,2015-07-18,31483430,Iliana,"The studio was exactly as it appeared in the pictures - clean and welcoming. Marian was a wonderful host and had a welcome packet prepared for us with some toiletries and a binder full of things to do in the area. She even checked in with us at the beginning of our stay to greet us and see if we needed anything, which was much appreciated. The studio is located about a block from the beach and parking is pretty easy. Overall, the stay was enjoyable and convenient, could not have asked for more. Would definitely stay here again when we are back in Seattle. "
2536507,39566709,2015-07-24,1390497,Phil,Really great place. Perfect quiet studio near Alki beach. Marian was a great host. 
2536507,41179654,2015-08-04,6530487,Brian,"Marian did a great job of welcoming us into her home. It was bright, comfortable, and the checkin process was very smooth. There were plenty of small touches that made the experience better than most. 

Her communication was excellent, we'll definitely stay here again!"
2536507,42319324,2015-08-12,4020349,Alex,"Marian's home is a beautiful perch above the beach-community vibe of West Seattle. Although I've been to Seattle many times, it felt like a totally new unique experience calling this place home for a night. The building is beautiful, the room is small and well-appointed with a terrific view, and the overall experience was wonderful. Would definitely recommend.  "
2536507,42561791,2015-08-14,12120039,Trish,"Perfect location, quiet end of the beach. Alki and surrounds never fail to please. Two nights- one hot, sunny day and meteor storm followed by thunderstorm and welcomed rain squall. Quick and clear communication. Early checkin appreciated. "
2536507,43726140,2015-08-21,37510126,Erica,Marian went above and beyond as a host. Her place was so beautiful and cozy. I absolutely loved the view and all the extra accommodations she provided to make is feel comfortable. I can't wait to go back and stay again!
2536507,43875348,2015-08-22,9681242,John,"Wish we could have stayed longer! Felt like we were in a 5 star hotel. Super comfortable bed, amazing shower, and stunning view. We did not hear our hosts at all, even with it being underneath them. Right in the heart of alki. Will definitely stay here again! 

Kate & john "
2536507,45076730,2015-08-31,7450406,Kevin,Great place with a very attentive owner. Amazing location and view. Would recommend it to others. 
2536507,45447721,2015-09-02,4827616,Joey,"Marian's house is gorgeous. I understand why it was featured in NW Life Magazine! Our room was basically a better version of a nice hotel room. Super cool modern feel with a mini fridge and microwave. It is only a short 5min walk to Alkai Beach where there are many places to eat. (Go to the Alkai Cafe for brunch!) We had such a nice stay here, and would do so again in a heartbeat!"
2536507,47440680,2015-09-18,3529485,Tyler,I don't have the words to express how thankful I am to have stayed at Marian's place.  I booked last minute and the communication was flawless.  When I got there the place was jaw dropping.  The architecture is beautiful and the view cannot be captured in pictures.  A short walk down to the waterfront for breathtaking views of the Seattle skyline.  I'd never heard of west Seattle before but after staying here would not stay anywhere else.  Don't bother looking at other listings in Seattle if this one is available.
2536507,47711714,2015-09-21,40747069,Acen,"My girlfriend and I decided to take our first trip together up to the Pacific Northwest to the beautiful city of Seattle. It was our goal to not only enjoy the city and sights but as much of the local lifestyle we could. After stumbling about Marian's listing, we knew instantly that we'd be staying there. From the jump, Marian was receptive, reliable, and quick to respond to any inquiries we had. It didn't take long for us to finally book the place.

Photos really do not do the home justice. The architecture was beautiful, the space was clean, and the views were breathtaking. We loved being able to walk down to the beach and taking the ferry out to downtown whenever we wanted to be near the hustle and bustle. It was the perfect balance!  

Marian was detailed in her instructions for the home (locking the doors, accessing WiFi, etc.) as well as how to get to various places in town via public transportation. She also provided an expansive list of spots to see, places to eat, and local activities - never did we feel lost or without anything to do. The next time we're back in Seattle, we'll be booking with Marian again!

TL;DR: If you are able to, seriously...pick this place, it's nothing short of perfect."
2536507,48463117,2015-09-26,30870666,Virgil,"Before we even set foot inside this ridiculously amazing property, Marian went out of her way to make us feel at home.  She was kind, responsive and generous.  Once we arrived, we found the studio in excellent condition.  My wife and I are both relatively obsessive when it comes to cleanliness, but this place was SPOTLESS.  The bath robes are a nice touch, and the basket full of local attractions and restaurants was perfect! We ate at a restaurant she recommended (Matador!) and we loved everything about it.  We chose to skip the wine she left for us because we brought our own along.  However, the two bottles of local wine she made available were excellent and we would have loved either the red or white she left.  
The location is amazing, the view is worth every penny and more, and I think the shower in the studio is roughly the same size as my first apartment.  The radiant heat floors are to die for, and I'm pretty sure I could live the rest of my life in the chairs on the patio in front of the studio listening to the waves crash gently onto Alki beach below.  Thank you for everything, Marian.  We loved everything about our experience.  You are truly a blessing. "
2536507,52038164,2015-10-26,17045734,Chase,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for an extended birthday trip for 9 days and it was exactly what we needed. Marian was a great host and responded quickly if we had any questions. The view from the porch is absolutely stunning as well. Don't let the lack of a full kitchen deter you, as there are numerous affordable restaurants located a short drive down the beach. "
2536507,52674314,2015-11-01,10034600,Amber,We loved staying here. The studio is quiet and very private. Street parking was pretty easy to find and the views and location made it worth it. Walked down to Alki beach on our first day - such a fun neighborhood. It's great being able to explore the city and then go back to the West Seattle for some peace and quiet. Wish we had been able to relax longer there but we were busy exploring. Highly recommended!
2536507,53158550,2015-11-05,33602211,Kj,"We loved our stay here.
Very private and serene.
Close to downtown Seattle and the host is very kind and responsive.
Thank you for hosting us,
Kat"
2536507,53456367,2015-11-09,40998941,Nancy,"Everything was so easy and this studio room met our requirements.  Architecture of house was clean and very attractive. Views were amazing!  Marian is very considerate host; great directions to house, restaurant and sightseeing recommendations provided. Would visit again! "
2536507,54231430,2015-11-17,38711581,Theresa,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Marion's place did not disappoint!  The listing was exactly as described, with plenty of parking opportunities and quick access to public transit, restaurants, and shops.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is traveling to the Seattle area.  Thanks again for helping us have such a fantastic trip!  "
2536507,54397790,2015-11-19,22862482,Andrew,"This was a sweet place. Clean and simple, and comfortable. The directions were easy to follow and we got there, parked, and got in with no problem.  It would have been great to use the patio chairs shown in the listing but we happened to stay during a cold, rainy, windstorm!

"
2536507,54967994,2015-11-27,26863096,Will,Great place and can't beat the location. We had a really awesome time there. Thanks very much.
2536507,55559744,2015-12-02,12486540,Monika,"Marian is a wonderful host and the apartment is fabulous!! It is spacious, very clean, and has a great view. The bed was comfortable with plenty of extra blankets. There were several big windows to let the light in. The location is in a very quite residential area, short drive or walk to parks, beach, restaurants. There is a private apartment entrance. Marian is available for communication anytime. She is very accommodating, kind, and caring. I felt like I was right at home and would love to stay again. I highly recommend!"
2536507,56371535,2015-12-13,13161020,Linda,"My boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better experience here in Seattle without the help and beautiful home and Marian and Jone. Although we never had a chance to meet, Marian always made sure my questions and concerns were always answered. She offered a great folder full of restaurant recommendations and sights to see in Seattle. This was tremendously helpful! 

We love that her place was so close to the beach, and we loved waking up to the beautiful view every morning.

Thank you Marian and Jone for opening your beautiful home to us! We can't thank you enough for the wonderful experience! We're missing Alki Beach and Seattle already!!"
2536507,56720306,2015-12-17,13467605,Rod,"Marian was a wonderful host.  She communicated with us before, during, and after we left the well appointed apartment.  The apartment is cozy with a great view just as the pictures depict.  West Seattle is a great place to stay while visiting Seattle.  We would love to stay again during the Spring or Summer months.   "
2536507,56848608,2015-12-19,5050795,Neena,"Very clean and comfortable condo with a great view. I also love the neighborhood - it is  beautiful,  quiet and so close to the beach. 

Marian is great in communication and making sure that we have everything we need. Thank you Marian!"
2536507,57100991,2015-12-21,24270452,Cory,"We had a fantastic time at Marian's place! It is a perfect combination of very clean and comfortable amenities, with an amazing location within walking distance of the beach and great food.
We've been to Seattle many times, but never to the West side and Alki beach.  It's now our favorite place in the area.  Thanks Marian!"
2536507,57516572,2015-12-27,45492879,M,It was a well insulated house which kept out the cold. Very clean and tidy. Peaceful area. The hosts are very professional. No problem giving this 5 stars.
7222136,41239952,2015-08-05,37921507,Neil,"Nice, simple and clean apartment. It was very comfortable and had a nice breeze with the windows open. Great location with easy access. We were able to walk everywhere. "
7222136,42159656,2015-08-11,1605121,Kelly,"Loved everything about our stay at Meredith's AMAZING apartment in Seattle! From her guide regarding the apartment itself (I'm so jealous she gets to live in that space everyday!) to what to see and do and how to get there, to welcoming us when we got in super late, to checking in to make sure everything was going great, to being available when we inquired about a 'hood that wasn't on her list...  It was a perfect stay! Her apartment has so much ridiculously awesome character and is in a great part of town, central to a beautiful walk or short uber away... If we find ourselves back in Seattle, we would definitely stay here again! Thank you Meredith! "
7222136,43080682,2015-08-17,36080830,Teresa,"The home was so cute and Meredith was a nice host. She left great information of surrounding restaurants and places to go. The apartment was a little chilly at times but had extra linen in the closet. Overall, it was a lovely apartment and location. Thanks Meredith!"
7222136,45096935,2015-08-31,8499437,Ian,"Meredith was helpful and her place was a joy to stay in. The place is decorated very nicely and everything was clean, neat and comfortable. Thanks for helping make my stay enjoyable!"
7222136,46899266,2015-09-14,5303463,Jack,"Meredith was the consummate host: she responded immediately to communication, had fantastic tips about the city, and couldn't have been more accommodating. Her apartment is exactly as advertised being both stylish and in the middle of Capitol Hill. She made our trip to Seattle one to remember, and if I could have her as a host for every airbnb I would. "
7222136,51368356,2015-10-19,28049113,Jordan,"Meredith could not have been any more welcoming. She met us at 11pm! We got in she showed us around walked us through all the little quirks of the house like how to unlock and lock the door. She left us an INCREDIBLE list of what to do in the neighborhood as far as coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The neighborhood was so quite and lush with trees and grass. The condo itself immediately felt like home.We kept all the windows open our entire stay. There is a co-op that is less than a block which is great to stock up on the necessities or snacks AND local produce! I will without a doubt be returning to this hidden gm."
7222136,51956009,2015-10-25,3873114,Emmaline,"We loved our stay at Meredith's cozy apartment! It is ideally located for exploring Capitol Hill by foot with easy access to bus lines to other parts of Seattle. The decor in the apartment is, as the pictures show, unique and fun. We found everything to be clean and in good working order; the shower had good water pressure and temperature control. The bed was extremely firm, but not uncomfortable. Meredith was a great communicator and very friendly, both over email and in person. She shared a great list of places to eat, drink, play, etc. in Seattle, and we had an amazing dinner at one of the places she recommended. One thing to mention: parking in the neighborhood is very challenging, so if you are driving, be prepared to hunt for a good spot. We parked and then got around as much as possible by foot, which worked out well. Thanks, Meredith, for sharing your lovely apartment with us!"
301059,1007108,2012-03-17,540312,Christine,"From start to finish, Darik and his employees made it easy - unlike several other property owners I contacted, Derik responded promptly, answered my questions, and made sure we had plenty of information that we needed to get there and get settled easily. They even offered great restaurant recommendations. We were met at the front door promptly, given a tour of the building, and shown the very nice condo. It's a great spot to use as home base if your destination is the museum/waterfront/pike place market. Macrina bakery is right outside the front door of the building, which sure makes it easy to get a great start on the day. Thanks to Darik for a great spot!"
301059,2482106,2012-10-02,2872755,Lisa,This was a beautiful space! I rented it for my mom and aunt when they were in town. It was clean and good size for two people. You can not beat the view of the sound. It's a great area to stay in because you are walking distance to everything. I would saw the only thing is that it would get really hot in there because of the sun coming in but you can't really comlain about that when you are in Seattle. 
301059,2506048,2012-10-04,1407228,A. Heather,"It's even better than it looks.  All the amenities of a high-end hotel (pool, hot tub, roof deck, extra fluffy blankets, shampoo and conditioner in the bath, wifi, etc.) plus the comforts of home (fully stocked kitchen and laundry, free parking downstairs).  The view was fabulous and the location in the heart of Belltown could not be better.  Our contact met us at the appointed time with no issues at all, gave a friendly orientation to the building and apartment, but if you aren't paying attention they very clearly lay everything out in the welcome packet for reference.  Really could not have been a better place to stay.  Only small complaint is that the night before I traveled they sent 30 pages of lease forms to download and sign which seemed excessive for a 2 night stay.   But absolutely worth it to pretend you live in a luxury condo in the coolest part of Seattle for a couple days. "
301059,2593573,2012-10-13,1632099,Catherine,"We had a great stay in Seattle. This apartment is in a great location - lots of restaurants, easy walk to ferry terminal and downtown. Darik and Sarah were great - excellent communication and accommodating to our late check in and early departure. Would definitely stay here again."
301059,2612571,2012-10-15,3264092,Eric,"My wife and I went up to Seattle for a quick weekend for a football game and our experience was fantastic.  From start to finish, the experience we had with this place was amazing.  Wonderful accommodations, friendly staff, and close to everything we wanted to see.  We highly recommend this place!"
301059,2874520,2012-11-13,2755301,Jenna,"We had a great stay!  The location was close to many attractions/restaurants and has a view of the water!  The host was very helpful with organizing our departure.  We didn't use much from the kitchen, but it was fully stocked.  Very safe, the street noise was somewhat loud in the mornings.  I would go back there in a heartbeat!"
301059,4395371,2013-05-02,553345,Roger,"This Belltown apartment is very well presented and organised with a lovely view out over Puget Sound, where it's possible to watch the ferries coming and going.  Kitchen, bathroom etc are all well appointed and equipped.
The location itself is excellent being in walking distance to Downtown and Pike Place as well as Seattle Centre and Space Needle.  Seattle itself is magnificent and the apartment was a great base to explore the surrounding areas, with parking easy in the basement garage,  If in Seattle during the baseball season, a visit to Safeco Stadium is recommended: 'Take Me Out the Ballgame!'
We can also recommend the nearby Belltown Pub, and heaps of restaurants and bars nearby, including an excellent Macrina Bakery in the building itself. 
Communication and checkin was smooth.
"
301059,19518403,2014-09-14,12095734,Nicki,"This is a lovely spot to land in Seattle. We dumped our car and walked along the water to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum as well as to their fabulous outdoor sculpture garden, to the numerous nearby restaurants with incredibly delicious food that we indulged in each night, as well as the boutiques and bars that are all a stones throw away in the Belltown neighborhood. The water view from the living room and small balcony is wonderful, and Darik and his staff were extremely kind and accomodating. We were able to check in early and to leave our bags in the condo on our last day past check out time. When I couldn't get the living room TV to work, they sent someone over the very next day to fix the problem, and the check-in was made easy with their excellent office staff. We had incredibly warm and sunny weather on our stay, and so the condo did heat up in the afternoon sun, but there was an air conditioner in the bedroom and 2 fans in the main living space, so with the curtains closed to keep out the afternoon sun, it was ok. But because we left the windows open at night, and because of the night life and proximity to the freeway, it was a bit noisy. Generally the weather in Seattle would allow windows to stay closed at night and the sound level wouldn't be an issue. The kitchen was well equipped and the whole place is tastefully decorated and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. And Darik and his staff are organized and helpful hosts."
301059,24691968,2015-01-01,735493,Joe,"Right in Belltown, Darik's condo was very nice, very clean, and it was professionally managed. The condo was cute and everything was well thought out. They were able to accommodate me late the same day. Everything about this place was great."
301059,30714818,2015-04-26,10212841,Emily,"We had a wonderful stay at the apartment on 1st Avenue.  The location was perfect, within walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle, many great restaurants and shopping as well.  Our host was extremely accommodating to our super late check in.  They really go over and beyond taking care of you.  The apartment itself is equipped with almost everything that you would; washer/dryer, ironing board, iron, blow dryer, umbrella, extra blankets, plentiful towels, and kitchen amenities.  This AirBnb experience really set the bar high and we only hope to experience the same wonderful service with future hosts.   I would highly recommend any of Darik's apartments.  Thank you so much! "
301059,31649756,2015-05-08,21283245,Xuena,"Great stay with Seattle Oasis, great location with a few blocks walking distance to the Pike Place Market and shopping malls. Apartments' everything is considered and well arranged, clean and exactly same as the photos online. Darik is very responsive and easy to communicated with, I will come back to stay with Oasis next time and highly recommend my friends to rent here too for sure."
301059,41071510,2015-08-04,6320938,Anne-Gaëlle,"If you appreciate organized things, this is it ! Darik and his team have everything planned, instructions, e-mails are very clear and communication is easy. Though it is not a common Airbnb experience as we usually do, but we know it at the beginning.
The appartment is exactly as on the pictures, even bigger than we were expecting.
Stunning views on the bay and boats, a big pool and hot tub, a fitness center, a rooftop with a barbecue, tons of restaurants, bars in the surroundings, and Macrina bakery just outside the building ! What else ?
Parking lot, washer and dryer and everything you need in the kitchen and bath.
We really recommend it ! 
Just 2 things to know : a bit noisy but you are in town, hot when the weather is sunny but you have fans and AC in the bedroom.

7646637,42062596,2015-08-10,40275347,Ralph,"We made this booking at the last minute, about a week before our trip to Seattle. Davis was very responsive to our questions before the visit. He was welcoming and helpful when we arrived, suggesting things roun Fremont that we could do. he also made sure that his home would accommodate us and our three teenage children, cringing in comfortable beds for the kids. We all enjoyed our stay very much. David even offered to wash some of our clothes (which we did not need). I needed to see a doctor on the night of our arrival and David pointed me towards the local hospital. We asked for a shower mat at one pojnt and he provided one instantly. In all, this was a great start to our vacation in Seattle and we'd stay again without hesitation."
7646637,43438275,2015-08-19,5633718,Jeremy,"Dave was easy to communicate with and responsive. My colleague was pleased with the arrangement and left the following review:

Dave’s space is nice and clean.  I saw Dave only once on the first night after checking in, he respected my privacy very much. Dave was very helpful and provided full support during my stay. We contacted each other via text messaging the whole time. He offered towels cleaning service and restocking miscellaneous even without my request. I really appreciated his nice gesture.  His home is lovely and easy to commute (only 5 minutes drive / 30 minutes walk to Fremont). The neighborhood is safe and beautiful. You will enjoy the walk around there in the morning."
7646637,44047140,2015-08-23,3085286,Anna,"Dave was very flexible and accommodating about pets and check in/check out times.  He was really easy to communicate with and texted us during our stay to make sure everything was going smoothly.   His place was clean and he had thoughtfully provided maps and suggestions of things to do in the area.  He even had an awesome ""emergency kit"" with bandaids, razors, etc.  Bed was really comfortable.  He has a fenced off yard which was great for our dog!  The neighborhood  around the house is quiet and safe with a great park nearby where you can bring your pet to play.  At the same time, it was a quick walk to Fremont and its plethora of coffee/food/drink/shops.   Great option for those looking to explore the city, especially if have animals!"
7646637,48632779,2015-09-27,30723814,Trish,Great location for Fremont/Ballard excursions! David was very responsive and flexible in arranging everything.
7646637,55401318,2015-12-01,46586625,Elsbeth,"David welcomed us to his home and was available and helpful when anything arose. Comfortable house, great neighborhood, very conveniently located for us. Potential renters should be aware that the big couch shown in the photo is not there. The only seating in the living room is the single chair shown in the photo. There is also only one chair in the kitchen."
7828222,44220978,2015-08-24,19443460,William,"The room is simple and the neighborhood is quiet, it's 10 mins walk to downtown, very convenient!
Lubna was amazing, never get to meet her since she's out of the country, but she checks on me to make sure everything are well, great communications!  "
7828222,44366506,2015-08-25,41516550,David,Nice and friendly hosts. The place was very spacious and cozy too. Great location. Recommend!
7828222,48543086,2015-09-27,4250360,Will,"Lubna's place was great! Very centrally located, enough room to sleep and relax, and very clean and tidy. We were able to get around very easily, walking to Capitol Hill and Downtown and using Uber and Lyft to get up to UW for a football game. She met us at the apartment and even drove us to dinner on the first night! Thank you so much!"
3168651,16683477,2014-07-31,4441105,David,"Jami was the greatest host ever! Friendly, knowledgable and always willing to go the extra mile to assist me. She even cooked me dinner one night. Can't recommend her enough.

The room was great and her location was great. Her place is right along Alki Beach which is a beautiful spot to walk along without the touristy-ness of downtown Seattle.

If I am back in the Seattle area I definitely plan to stay here again.

"
3168651,17025228,2014-08-05,5235003,Betty,"My host was generous about loaning me her bike, sharing dinner and carrying my bag up 3 flights of stairs.
The apartment was nicely furnished without a dining spot. The room was
Thankfully away from the busy, noisy Alki Beach. It is very convenient for walking to dining spots and for watching the sunset. "
3168651,17474057,2014-08-12,11478997,Richard,"The neighborhood location is perfect. across from the beach, in the middle of a lot of commercial activity -- bars, restaurants, coffee houses, bike rental shops -- it's all within a block or three. the room is on the top floor of an old brick 4-story apartment building. if you're not in decent shape, it could be tough to navigate the stairs. but it's worth it. the bedroom is in the back of the building and the back of Jami's apartment. translation: QUIET, very quiet. that's saying something in the middle of this very busy, touristy area. there is also a reserved parking space in back. Jami is very accommodating, offering coffee ready to french press, with croissants tagging along. overall, a pleasant experience.  "
3168651,17662563,2014-08-15,10592675,Fartun,"Jami was a very helpful and gracious host. As mentioned, perfect location and the room was very quiet with an extremely comfortable bed. She offered to make us dinner and provided us with snacks for the road. She also gave us several suggestions for food and coffee options in the area. Thanks! "
3168651,17950115,2014-08-19,16209376,Bill,"Amazing location and host!  You literally walk across the street onto the beach.  Great breakfast and lunch venues within walking distance as well as kayaking, rental bikes, etc.  Not much of a view from the room, but its quiet. And although the bathroom is shared with the ultra cool host, it was never an issue.  It might be a little cozy for two people, but it would be fine.  Nice bed, and I slept perfectly!  Great coffee and fruit in the morning, perfect for solo travelers!"
3168651,18210161,2014-08-23,17743915,Claude,"It was the perfect fit with what I was looking for: a clear and quiet room at walkable distance from my son's house.
Jami is a great and thoughtful hostess."
3168651,18444995,2014-08-26,20070914,Barbara,"Jami made me feel very welcome both before and during my stay - a great host. The location is fabulous, right on Alki beach and if you like cats, this is definitely the place for you. "
3168651,18897367,2014-09-02,18198541,Eike,"It was a beautiful stay. Jami was a perfect host. We had everything we need. The room is cozy and the bed is very comfortable. The location is great, direct at Akli Beach with breakfast, coffee, lunch spots next door. "
3168651,33708600,2015-05-31,29833384,Loretta,"I stayed with Jami for 11 nights while working in Kent. She was a wonderful and accommodating host. My first night I arrived after traveling, working and commuting by bike to a delicious salmon home cooked dinner. She showed me around her apartment I meet her cats and we chatted a bit about our backgrounds.

I asked if I could keep my bike in her apartment and she made room in her place to secure my belongings. I really appreciated that!  

The room was very comfortable (definitely better than my own bedroom!)  and I had amble room for my things and there were plenty of clean linens. 

I was there for some time so access to the kitchen was helpful. Jami had food available for me to eat if I liked and I also did some cooking myself. 

Jami left midway between my stay so I had the apartment to myself. She did call and text several times to make sure I had everything I needed.

I would highly recommend staying at Jami's place on Alki beach. The commute to work everyday was beautiful. The sunrise and sunset along the beach was breathtaking!

I look forward to my next visit to Seattle and hope I can stay with Jami again!"
3168651,37057428,2015-07-04,33322054,Paul,"Jami was exceptionally warm and inviting, helping me to feel right at home from the instant I showed up until the day I left. Very comfortable little room right on Alki beach. Would definitely recommend! "
3168651,37879348,2015-07-11,33322054,Paul,Jami was very welcoming! Definitely a nice little spot right there on Alki beach. Plenty of nice restaurants right next door and beautiful scenery all around!
3168651,40629800,2015-08-01,18529343,Jordan,Jami is a fantastic host who clearly has experience in making her guests feel as at-home as possible. She might even cook a meal or two - things like that can elevate a stay. 
3168651,41826567,2015-08-09,5151184,Nicola,"Jami was a perfect hostess.  She welcomed me into her quaint cosy and comfortable home upon my late afternoon arrival, ensuring I had everything I needed for a week of work and a little weekend adventure during my stay.  Alki beach is a busy location but I enjoyed every minute I got to be there. The views were stunning and I miss them already!!!   The commute into Downtown Seattle was a little over 20 minutes by car.  

I would highly recommend Jami's home and would definitely choose to stay with her again when I return to Seattle "
3168651,42766973,2015-08-15,14294788,K,"Jami was the perfect hostess and her room is very comfy.  The location is excellent, the beach lively and fun and our room was beautifully prepared.  Jami had kindly reserved us refrigerator space and offered generous kitchen access, a beach chair and blanket.   Her whole home is immaculate. I enjoyed swapping stories with Jami.   She also very kindly gave us a ride to the airport.  "
3168651,46880545,2015-09-14,37507337,Jack,"Jami was very helpful and nice, room was clean, neighborhood was great, across from beach and close to good restaurants."
3168651,47784550,2015-09-21,15310771,Mike,I enjoyed playing beach volleyball all afternoon literally across the street from  Jami's place.  I also enjoyed having numerous places to go for meals and drinks that were a short walk away.  Jami was very accommodating.    
3768742,17033411,2014-08-05,222969,Joshua,Her place is in a great neighborhood and the view from the back porch is great. She was quick to get back with questions and everything was clean and easy to figure out.
3768742,17246982,2014-08-09,1489517,Mike,"I was thrilled with my brief stay. Though we did not meet, Annie and I communicated with each other often to make sure the logistics were sorted out in advance of my arrival. Though Annie was out of the country, she was responsive to my questions. My stay with Annie went off without a glitch. 

It has a good location with regard to places to eat and is very safe. For me, Annie's home had a wonderful smell that reminded me of a house I used to live in, so that made my stay a bit extra special. 

Thanks Annie...."
3768742,17412875,2014-08-11,15721709,Daniel,"The home is nice and well kept in a quiet neighborhood. Great views from the back porch. 
Due to traveling in Asia, Annie and I had communication problems the first night, but Annie more than made up for the inconveniences and she did it proactively without me asking. She is a great host to deal with.  I would recommend her to anyone. Thank you! "
3768742,17655775,2014-08-15,19344157,Pulkit,"It was a great experience living here!  We got an awesome home like environment and the place is beautifully decorated. Annie is a great host, is very friendly and  always communicated promptly. Will definitely recommend the place,  it's a work of art."
3768742,17808566,2014-08-17,10698140,Viena,Annie's bungalow is a jewel in a great part of Seattle. It was very comfortable and has a very eclectic feel. I loved the photographs!
3768742,18612523,2014-08-28,7861969,Corinna,Annie's place was a lovely home base for our visit to Seattle. It is a sweet and very eclectic artist's apartment in a quiet neighborhood walking distance to both Wallingford and Fremont. Annie's was traveling while we were there but all our needs were totally taken care of.
3768742,19443276,2014-09-12,5091043,Eva,The kitchen looks very nice in the morning. And you can see the downtown of Seattle from the porch!! Great location to downtown but traffic in the morning to downtown is very busy. It's a little pricy for what you get but this is the best option I had at that time. 
3768742,19575679,2014-09-14,18749576,James,Great neighborhood! Annie was very welcoming and had some excellent suggestions for food and fun. The house has a good view and awesome décor.
3768742,38576031,2015-07-16,11567733,Chuck,"I appreciate that Annie let me in with very short notice. She met me and showed me around. Everything was as expected, thanks.  "
3768742,41835927,2015-08-09,29967486,David,"Annie really saved me when another airbnb host cancelled on me with less than 10 days until my arrival. Due to the event I was going to, there was nothing reasonable available. Annie made an exception for me and I'm truly grateful. 

The house itself has a lot of character. I had no real issues and although I was at my event for upwards of 15-16 hours a day, Annie was always very kind when I ran into her. I would definitely stay there again."
8052307,44745533,2015-08-28,41773085,Brittany,"Skyler's communication was great. He was helpful when I asked questions before booking, made sure I knew where I was going, and that I was comfortable when I got arrived. It was very thoughtful, asking if I had any dietary restrictions for breakfast. He also shared some of his homemade goodies... I felt very lucky! I was a little disappointed to see that the couch is actually a love seat. Though it was cozy to sit on, it probably would have been small for sleeping. Luckily, Sklyer happen to have another open bed he let me inhabit for the evening. That was above and beyond and, again, very thoughtful. The airmatress on the bunk bed wasn't the most comfortable, but I can't complain and it's not the bed I'm reviewing! Walls are thin in the apartment so you can hear a lot. The rest of the house is definitely a dude pad with a big screen TV, games, Netflix, and a bare essentials bathroom... So if that works for you, as it did for me, you'll be set!"
8052307,45227466,2015-08-31,32078479,Austin,"Skyler and his friends were accomodating, easy-going, respectful and just all around good people! They really made me feel at home Skyler was a perfect host. Highly  recommended."
8052307,45760225,2015-09-05,43237914,Dejan,"This room i rented for my friends, because they left with no place to stay at the last moment (room that they rent, was to complicated to reach and the owner was not stated that). I contacted Skyler because i already rent his Comfy bunkbead2/breakfast and we arrange everything immediately for my friends and find them place to sleep. Staying at Skyler`s place was great, and i would recommend it always. If i come back again in USA i will stay there again. Place is well positioned just 2 stops with light train from Sea-Tac airport. And for Skyler and his friends i have just to say, keep it up."
8052307,46089723,2015-09-07,34693274,Oli,"Nice place with very nice/welcoming/generous hosts. Comfy airbed and good facilities. Was a little worried when I first arrived that it was in the middle of nowhere, but just a short hop on the citylink will get you right into the heart of seattle. Would recommend!"
8052307,47946966,2015-09-21,43547858,Timothee,"Great host. I came in, got comfy, and fell asleep. Netflix was available. Also a few snacks. The room was clean and comfortable."
8052307,55994039,2015-12-07,49892615,Jo,As described
9509279,54962360,2015-11-25,10174007,Kayla,"Ash was very easy to communicate with, and accommodating on the check-in time. However the place was not very clean. :( 

"
9509279,55956105,2015-12-07,15241647,Denny,"Cool host who communicates easily and timely. Can't get a better location and a great space. Wasn't 'hotel' standard clean but didn't bother me. No parking available and actually got a ticket. Also, lost host's keys and had to pay a 100 fee because of the electronic buzzer attached. "
9509279,56540169,2015-12-14,12550673,Anthony,It was great! Ash's place is in a great location that's close to everywhere. He was also very easy to communicate with! 
9509279,57187410,2015-12-22,37042793,Samantha,"We had a great stay at Ash's apartment! Location was perfect, walking distance to Pike Place Market, light rail, downtown shopping and lots of food and bars. We got in pretty late and he was super accommodating and easy to get in touch with. If you get in before the light rail shuts down for the evening I would recommend taking the light rail to the Westlake station from the airport, $3.00 one way (the station is 0.5miles from the apartment) compared to a $30.00 uber drive! Overall great stay! "
4607830,23795572,2014-12-10,24010700,Baibing,"Devin and Linda were fantastic! Devin greeted me the night I arrived, gave me the keys and showed me around their wonderful apartment. The apartment was really nice and clean, simple and comfortable. It really is in an awesome location. Even though I didn't have any time to explore the neighborhood (or Seattle for that matter) due to my busy schedule during my time in there, I did notice that the neighborhood has a lot of really nice spots such as coffee shops and bars, it's close to the subway/metro/train (very easy to get to and from the airport), and not far from the main downtown shopping and dining areas. 
All in all, I would stay at Devin and Linda's again if I come back to Seattle. Too bad I didn't get the chance to get to know them because I of my busy schedule, but from our brief interactions, I think that Devin and Linda are genuinely awesome and fun people. I am very glad I chose to stay at their place during this trip."
4607830,23826176,2014-12-11,21463364,Jonathan,"Devin and his wife were easily the best hosts I could ask for for my brief stay in Seattle. Though it was my second time in the city they helped it really feel like home. As people they were incredibly warm and receptive and absolutely lovely. They had provided Seattle coffee, a french press, a growler for beer for a local place around the corner it was fantastic! I almost didn't want to write a review so that I could stay at this place exclusively every time I was in town. The apartment was clean, well kept and stocked with everything you could reasonably ask for. 10/10 would definitely come back to this location. "
4607830,23915985,2014-12-14,596423,Kim & Pete,"Great location, comfy place, and spacious too. Devin was super friendly and easy to communicate with. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with lots of tasty eateries. Walking distance to all the great sites. Free parking under the building. What more could you ask for? We enjoyed our stay and are confident you will too. "
4607830,23961247,2014-12-15,18883151,Will,"Our stay was perfect!  The apartment was clean, in a great location, and the host was super accommodating!  I would highly recommend this place if you're coming to Seattle."
4607830,24113079,2014-12-20,23993647,Jonathan,"Awesome location, comfortable and all-around pleasant! This apartment really is amazingly located; walking distance to downtown Seattle and Pike Place but also near all of the great bars and restaurant in Capitol Hill. Great public transportation options as well. I was visiting Seattle for work and had no problem making it to Pioneer Square every morning by bus.  I would strongly suggest this apartment to anyone visiting town!"
4607830,24152519,2014-12-21,3034505,Pit,"Beautiful new apartment, great neighborhood, we walked everywhere! Added bonus: free parking in the secure garage. Communication with Devin was great, we will be staying here again!"
4607830,24239607,2014-12-23,3851674,Jimmy,The apartment was very comfortable. It's located in a great location that is easy to get around. It was wonderful having a parking spot for our rental car as well. The apartment is large and incredibly comfortable.
4607830,24309065,2014-12-25,24480367,Sonya,These folks were super welcoming. The place was exactly what we needed for our stay and the location was perfect! The only downfall was we only stayed there one night! I will definitely book here again on my next visit to Seattle. 
4607830,24429825,2014-12-28,9308689,Maria,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Devin's place for 3 nights over Christmas. His apartment was very spacious, clean, warm and above all, an amazing location. Devin was very accommodating and meeting him for the keys was very easy. He was very helpful with advise for restaurants and places to visit. The overall experience was great! "
4607830,24545686,2014-12-30,10593363,Sebastien,"Communication with Devin was easy and efficient. He did his best to make us feel welcome and was very flexible for the checkin and checkout.
There is no lie about the location, it is indeed ideal! Plenty of nice restaurants and bars within a 5mins walk radius.
The apartment is really spacious and the bed comfortable.

We unfortunately did not had the chance to hang out with Devin but he seemed like a very open minded and interesting person !

Thanks Devin! :)"
4607830,24852593,2015-01-03,6036506,Steve,Awesome location!  Close to the Public Market and easy freeway access. The rooftop view was incredible!  Sunrise & sunset photo ops daily.  The only thing that would have made our stay better was if the unit had a dining table & chairs.  We would stay there again if given the chance. 
4607830,25039377,2015-01-05,19935047,Joe,"Great place to stay! Awesome host, and location, would definitely stay there again!"
4607830,25203143,2015-01-09,2498064,Alessandro,"Awesome apartment in a great location! I was attending a conference at the Washington State Conference Center, this apartment is only a 10 minute walk away.
There's a nice coffee shop right next to the apartment, where I had breakfast every morning, and a tiny sushi bar around the corner serving delicious food.
Devin has been very helpful, I definitely recommend staying here!"
4607830,25243590,2015-01-10,24416108,Kendall,"Apartment was very clean and in a great location.  Devin was super helpful and provided recommendations for places to eat nearby, and flexible with checking in/out.  I would definitely stay there again!"
4607830,25297167,2015-01-11,7037546,Jordan,"Devin was incredibly warm and helpful. I only stayed a night, but I felt right at home. "
4607830,25386712,2015-01-14,24764529,Jill,"We had a great stay at Devin and Linda's apartment.   It was clean, comfortable and modern.  The location in Capital Hill was very convenient to buses, restaurants and coffee shops.  The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe walking everywhere."
4607830,25443957,2015-01-16,15528437,David,Place was nice and in an excellent location.  Devin was friendly. The free parking and low cleaning costs were definitely a bonus! We would stay again
4607830,25597336,2015-01-20,2985002,Shayna,"Wonderful host! Super quick response times, and we had everything we needed in the apartment. Wonderful stay!"
4607830,26097392,2015-02-03,9501943,Nick,Stayed at Devin's gorgeous apartment for 2 weeks while visiting on business.  Wonderful location and unit.  Devin met me upon arrival and made sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  He and Linda are awesome hosts and delightful people.  Highly recommended Airbnb'ers :)
4607830,57596121,2015-12-27,51584964,Zixuan,Devin was a great host. He made things so much easier for both of us. Sweet little place in the middle of everything. Highly recommended. 
4607830,57954897,2015-12-30,19603296,Karl,"Devin was there to greet me and show me around. He gave me several great suggestions for nearby restaurant and bars. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and the bed and bedding were comfy, I slept pretty well and the shower worked well. 

This was and excellent spot to walk and bus around from, I thought that parking my car during  He day was a bit of a hassle but there were plenty of spots around and there were no problems over night. 

I didn't end up using the small kitchen but I would have if I had stayed longer. Also, Devin hooked up a chromecast that I didn't end up using but it was nice to have available. Overall this spot was great!"
4607830,58412848,2016-01-02,37357300,Karyn,This apt was clean and great location. Had the basic amenities to have a hang out before going to celebrate NYE. Devin and his wife were responsive to our questions. 
25002,37440,2010-04-23,106760,Anthony,"First, would I stay here again - YES.  The room is a little funky because its a converted garage, but its not expensive either.  The bed is most comfortable you will ever find, the bathroom is totally new and very well done, the back yard is lovely, and Amanda is very considerate host.  Stay here."
25002,39798,2010-05-03,73959,Bob,"Amanda's apartment is convenient and comfortable.

Amanda and her daughter were very welcoming.

I hope their room is available when I next need to be in Seattle."
25002,44334,2010-05-20,107717,Rita,Amanda and Luisa were great hostesses. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom and room were clean. I would definitely stay here again. Ballard is a special place and the transportation to get around was easy.
25002,47792,2010-05-30,119746,Chad,"The images of the room do not do it justice. It is a large, well furnished room that Amanda continues to improve. It is a very nice, comfortable place to stay with all of the convenience of home. I felt very safe in the neighborhood if you are unfamiliar with the area. There are many local places to eat, shop, and explore in Ballard. Right next door is Freemont, which has even more to offer. An easily accessible bus can take you downtown in 15-20 minutes.

Amanda is a great hostess, willing to help out in any way possible. She also knows a lot about the city if you need some help finding things to do.

The room was great and made our trip to Seattle easier, more fun, and less stressful because we saved money we would have spent at an expensive hotel.

I have absolutely no complaints, our trip was great, thank you very much!"
25002,52594,2010-06-13,88943,Veronica,"Amanda's room was perfect for me.  It was clean and comfortable, cool on a hot day.  Nothing fancy but everything I needed was there.  She even left a plate of cookies to welcome me.  The neighborhood is nice and walkable, Amanda was very friendly and I would definitely stay there again."
25002,55944,2010-06-21,147121,Ellen,"Amanda's neighborhood was beautiful, quiet, friendly and full of fabulous flowers.  We had everything we needed for a lovely stay- very comfortable bed- great coffee- nice bowl of fruit and very addictive chocolate cake.  Amanda told us about a bakery 3 blocks away, that might be worth the visit all by itself.  Amanda's is not luxurious, except for everything that is important."
25002,57184,2010-06-25,147877,Peggy,"We were coming to Seattle to pick up relatives from their cruise; the location was perfect because we were able to avoid early morning Seattle traffic. And what a bonus to have such great accomodations.  The room was large and lovely; I felt at home immediately.  Amanda, thoughtfully, had provided a book of Seattle attractions which we used to guide us over to Green Lake and enjoyed a brisk walk around the lake on a gorgeous summer afternoon.  After a late dinner in the U district (but there are two restaurants nearby that we'll try next time) we settled down for the night in bliss -- absolute peace and quiet ...and the most comfortable bed.  I sometimes have trouble falling asleep when I'm out of town; not here.  A bite of fresh fruit in the morning, and we were on our way to the cruise ship terminal, rested and refreshed. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
25002,58492,2010-06-28,138911,Stephanie,"This was a lovely room and bathroom. Totally private, clean and in a lovely neighborhood. Private entrance, and she left us brownies and fruit! Highly recommended."
25002,60006,2010-07-02,145060,Michele,"What a great hostess. Amanda was friendly from the first email contact to the last goodbye. The room, a converted garage, was very comfortable. I was greeted with a place of homemade brownies, fruit, and milk in the fridge, a private bathroom full of conveniences, and warm helpfulness.  I was traveling light, so things like extra bathroom items, lotion and shampoo, were especially welcome as was the use of Amanda's washer and drier. There are restaurants and shop within walking distance, and the area is perfect for early morning runs, or walks to pick up a paper. It was also great to see Luisa wearing English World Cup Team socks, and to have my only decent cup of tea on my travels - British people take note!"
25002,61500,2010-07-05,35189,Sherry,"The room and bath had everything I needed to relax and be comfortable after busy days around Seattle. Amanda is very welcoming and helpful. The coffee/tea,fruit, and brownies were nice extras. I was even invited upstairs to watch an early morning soccer match! The room is pleasant and homey and I could read, write, and sleep peacefully. I will go back again."
25002,62676,2010-07-09,64613,Sue,Great place to stay. My stay was brief but Amanda was a wonderful host and great brownies and comfortable bed.
25002,65314,2010-07-16,7960,Kate,"My friend and I needed a quiet, well-equipped place to stay for an overnight in Seattle, and Amanda's place fit the bill. Everything was just as described and we were welcomed with a plate of yummy homemade cookies and a fruit bowl. Amanda was friendly and helpful. The room is in the basement and we could hear someone walking above in the wee hours, not really a problem, but might be for some. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wants a comfy, relaxing stay."
25002,70100,2010-07-28,144662,Rebecca,"I went to Seattle for a training at UW (and to write) and  I couldn't have found a better place to stay!  The bed was comfy, the coffee was amazing, the place was very clean (and newly remodeled, including the bathroom), and Amanda and Luisa were incredibly welcoming.  As soon as I walked into the apartment the cheerful, warm vibe hit me (as did the delicious fruit and cookies)!  It is close to two lines of public transport, and within walking distance of several cafes and good restaurants.  I was traveling alone, didn't have a car, and felt totally safe walking the three residential blocks back from the bus stop at 1AM (if you drive, there seems to be tons of street parking).  The yard is gorgeous, and I spent many a morning sipping coffee on the deck.  Amanda and her daughter are both wonderful hosts; they possess a nice blend of laid-back and accommodating.  Amanda teaches elementary school and is very interesting to talk to, and pointed me in the direction of some great things to do in Seattle and Ballard.  (The Ballard Locks/English garden was a nice half-hour walk, and Phinney/Greenwood about fifteen minutes).  The bus to Fremont took less than ten, and my trip to the university was 45 minutes, tops.  

Even if I could afford a downtown hotel, it was much nicer to stay here--a ""home away from home.""  I am already wondering how soon I can plan my next trip back to Seattle and ""Beautiful, Quiet, and Friendly Ballard""!

25002,72283,2010-08-01,82393,Merala,"It was a pleasure to stay in Amanda's home. The room is spacious and cozy and everything you need is available including fresh brownies and fruit! The bathroom is across the hall. I was able to access wifi and enjoyed the ""i-home"" clock. The neighborhood is quiet and residential and fun to walk in. Because it's a former garage it was a little damp but not a problem for me. I appreciated the sense of privacy."
25002,75757,2010-08-08,118405,Joe,"GREAT place! Amanda is a wonderful hostess and we felt right at home, especially with her little extras: fruit, Melitta coffee filters & cone, tea, cookies. The bed was very comfortable, and the apartment is modern, clean, with a very nice bathroom.

The neighborhood is quiet, and close (by car) to downtown Ballard, which is wonderful.  We highly recommend Ray's seafood restaurant, near downtown Ballard.

Again, Amanda is great -- highly recommended!  Thank you, Amanda!

Joe & Donna"
25002,78296,2010-08-14,58569,Jenny,"Amanda is an absolute delight, she's helpful and fun, and her downstairs room and private bath are lovely, with everything wished for for a comfortable stay.  And more; I did NOT wish for the brownies but they were yummy.  So thoughtful. 

Lots of parking, public transportation is close by, as are a nice coffee house/bakery, pizza place, great market and assorted restaurants. Perfect!"
25002,81488,2010-08-19,170897,Carol,"Nice, clean, and pleasant room in which to stay.  Amanda is very welcoming and made us feel comfortable and safe. She even helped us with directions for getting places and suggestions of places to visit."
25002,82422,2010-08-21,13071,Kevin,Amanda was great and the room/bathroom was awesome! Very clean! Amanda was also very accommodating on short notice! Would totally stay again if in the Seattle area!
25002,88271,2010-09-01,181336,Wendy,"Staying with Amanda was awesome.  She is great in responding via email before you arrive.  The room was clean, the bed/bath was private enough for me and my husband, and the extra amenities (washer/dryer, wireless internet, access to the backyard and the quiet family neighborhood) made it seem like home.  Of course, the cookies and fruit she has in the room waiting for your arrival are pretty awesome too.  I highly recommend a stay at Amanda's for any out of towners.  "
25002,89713,2010-09-03,205346,Chris,"I had such a great experience staying here.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.  The room is spacious and cozy, the bed quite possibly the most comfortable i have ever slept on, and the fresh fruit & cookies a nice treat.  The location is quiet & safe, very close to several bus stops, and a short lovely walk to dowtown ballard.  Amanda is a wonderful host.  In emails as i planned my trip and in meeting her when i arrived she was clear, helpful, and kind.  She has created a wonderful space for travellers to enjoy Seattle from.  Thank you Amanda!"
25002,90596,2010-09-05,192306,Laura,"My parents stayed with Amanda while visiting. They had nothing but great things to say. Comfy bed, great location. She left fresh baked cookies, fresh fruit, and had extra odds and ends for the forgetful or light traveler. Thank you!"
25002,93379,2010-09-08,215483,Andy,My son and I had a wonderful time staying ay Amanda's place. The bed and sofa-bed were both good for sleeping. All facilities were excellent. And Amanda is a terrific host.
25002,100676,2010-09-19,237080,Alex,Fantastic place. The other reviews have covered a lot of the great qualities of both the room and Amanda as a host. Highly recommended and I would love to stay here again if I were in the area. Thanks Amanda!
25002,105248,2010-09-26,178993,Jacque,"This was a great place to stay.  I felt very safe and comfortable.  There was everything I needed to meet my needs for the week and yes, the brownies were great!
J.S."
25002,109566,2010-10-01,244900,Katerina,"Amanda's place was so cozy, super clean, quiet and private ~ it was just perfect! She must have put a lot to thought into making the place so nice and welcoming. I also appreciated the herbal tea, organic fruits! I would definitely sign up for future stays when I am in town again! Thank you for being a great host!"
25002,119384,2010-10-15,144127,Rikke,"I was doing a cookery course for 2.5 weeks in Seattle (Oct 2010) and it was important for me to find a place where I could really feel at home and safe whilst there. Amanda's studio was like an oasis of calmness and cosyness with fluffy soft towels, an amazingly comfy bed and a smart newly renovated bathroom (with heated floors!) to boot. And a real sense of privacy since there is a seperate entrance and bathroom.

Amanda made sure I was looked well after and was full of helpful tips and suggestions. She is also a really wonderful mum and a fun and interesting person to get to know. And her daughter Luisa gives you renewed hope in teenagers - so mature and well-behaved! Looking forward to my next stay already.

25002,128810,2010-10-28,238019,Ellen,"very nice and comfortable,will recommend to family and friendsm"
25002,130123,2010-10-30,244900,Katerina,"We very much appreciate the thoughtfulness that Amanda put into this nice resting place. It is clean, cozy and quiet. Convenient location.  Thank you for the organic fruits, and healthy beverages!"
25002,137676,2010-11-12,270117,Richard,"Amanda has created a beautiful, private studio in her basement.  She has thought of everything: homemade brownies when we arrived, refrigerator, microwave, dishes, cutlery, information on Seattle highlights, a very comfortable bed, and heated bathroom floor.  We were able to prepare light meals which is great when you are on the road a long time.  But just around the corner are several restaurants and a great French bakery/coffee bar (some of the best croissants to be had in Seattle).  Amanda was available to answer questions and seems to really enjoy having guests in her home.  I hope we can stay again."
25002,149723,2010-12-06,298137,Amelia,"We arrived to a cute little garage door adorned with warm yellow tube lights, beckoning us in to a heated refuge with a scrumptious plate of chocolate pecan brownies welcoming us from our late night flight from Chicago. 

The room was as seen in the picture, with more amenities than I had imagined (think mini fridge, water jug, hot water boiler, microwave, plates, mugs, cutlery, weighing scale.. do bring your own hair dryer if you are the type that needs it). The bed was comfortable and the room was well insulated and you can adjust the temperature to your own comfort level. Parking was easy with ample street parking at no cost. 

Amanda is no stranger to hosting guests, very responsive with emails, and knew how to prepare important notes in advance, like providing wireless codes and compiling maps and travel brochures on things to do around Seattle and WA. We had an amazing stay with Amanda and would love to come back to live with her again, unless I decide to permanently settle down in Seattle!"
25002,156540,2010-12-21,215419,Jessica,Our stay with Amanda was short but certainly sweet! She went out of her way to help two girls with very large suitcases find her apartment. As previous guests have said the range of facilities on offer are fantastic and the location is great. Next time we pay a visit to Seattle we'll certainly be seeing if Amanda has availability.
25002,165428,2011-01-04,277031,Alexandra,amanda is a lovely person and very welcoming. On my arrival there was some delicious brownies waiting for me to gobble up. She lives in a leafy quiet street which was exactly what I was looking for. The bed was incredibly comfortable! I was looking for somewhere quiet that wasn't too far from downtown and this place ticked all the boxes. If I ever go back to Seattle I will surely stay here again! also there is an excellent pho place just around the corner.
25002,190532,2011-03-01,342290,Paul,Amanda was quite simply a wonderful host. She was very responsive to emails and I felt that she was always willing to 'go the extra mile' to make my stay with my six-year-old daughter as enjoyable and pleasant as possible. I would recommend staying at Amanda's place to anyone who is visiting the Seattle area.
25002,195833,2011-03-10,349513,Louis,We had a great week at Amanda's apartment.  Very clean and comfy....will become our home away from home when we visit our grandson.  Walking distance to everything you need.
25002,201772,2011-03-17,410045,Gemma,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Amanda's studio in Ballard, and hada  wonderful time. Her studio is is comfortable with an AMAZING bed and brand new bathroom, and there were the most delicious brownies waiting for us when we arrived. It's little touches like this that set's Amanda apart and makes for a lovely stay. Her place is very near all the action in Ballard, which is a very cute and trendy neighbourhood.Infact, we only ventured into the city centre once as Ballard has it all. There is a fantastic bakery, pizza place and Mexican within walking distance. I would definitely recommend Amanda's place to anyone staying in Seattle."
25002,214540,2011-04-01,435405,Moe,"it's was really nice, comfortable and quiet. "
25002,216749,2011-04-04,411335,Rebecca,"Lovely!  Very warm and friendly...and the most comfy bed ever!!
"
25002,222216,2011-04-10,426974,Jennifer,"we loved amanda's space in ballard! it was quiet, comfortable, cozy, and private--everything we needed. amanda was such a kind host--super friendly and thoughtful (yummy brownies upon arrival!). thanks amanda for the perfect stay :). i will definitely recommend this place to anyone passing through!"
25002,236573,2011-04-23,22331,Mary Beth,"Amanda's place is cute and well-cared for. She has two very, sweet cats! My parents stayed at her place while they were visiting me, and they had a great, cozy experience. Amanda is easy to connect with in person and by email and phone. Her home is in a quiet area on a quiet street that is well-located for getting around and enjoying places like Ballard and Fremont (neighborhoods in Seattle)."
25002,246815,2011-05-01,499339,Charlene,"Friendly decor, homemade cookies as a greeting and wireless internet made our stay really enjoyable."
25002,250724,2011-05-03,284455,Chandra,"Amanda was a friendly host and her space was clean, well-located,  spacious and fairly comfortable.  Lots of people haved raved about the bed which perhaps inflated my expectations; I found it to be pretty  standard (however I did appreciate that it was placed to allow access from both sides).  The only caveat is that due to its basement-location, it can be slightly musty (even with the windows open), so if that is an issue for you it might not be the best fit (however I am admittedly rather hyper-sensitive to that sort of thing so it is probably fine for most people).  The garden is lovely and there was plenty of light from the windows; it doesn't feel like you are in a basement since the door opens into it from the front yard.  Amanda was easy to talk to and had great recommendations for local eateries.  She also very considerately left a lovely bowl of fruit for us to enjoy when I mentioned that we would prefer not to have brownies or cookies in the room.  Thanks Amanda!"
25002,277603,2011-05-23,594252,Rena,"Amanda's was perfect for our weekend in Seattle!  Ballard is a great neighborhood.  The place as warm, welcoming and had everything we needed!  Thanks Amanda.  We'll definitely be back!"
25002,280372,2011-05-25,446134,Alissa,"Amanda's house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood in Seattle.  We had no problem getting around using public transportation (there are bus stops within a couple blocks), although in retrospect it would have been nice to have a car.  Easy check in and lots of little touches, like a variety of teas and brownies upon arrival, made this a wonderful stay.  "
25002,285588,2011-05-28,620277,Robin,Amanda's home is beautiful and in a wonderful location. She provides comfy touches to your stay and the room/bathroom are very clean and neat. I hope to return soon!
25002,298976,2011-06-05,512361,Jonathan,"We had a great time staying at Amanda's. Clean, comfortable, private and  super handy to Ballard. Recommended!"
25002,311067,2011-06-13,509799,Barbara,"We spent 8 days sightseeing and each night looked forward to a restful sleep in a very comfortable queen-size bed.  It was truly a pleasure to stay at Amanda's:  she's a great hostess and I have to agree with other reviewers that she makes the best brownies ever!  I know we'll plan another visit.....thank you, Amanda!"
25002,320343,2011-06-18,354828,Dody,"Clean and comfy – everything you need is provided for you.  Lots of drawers, as well as a closet for hanging items (hangers included).  Wonderful bed, lots of pillows, extra linens and towels also provided.  Room was originally the garage (under the house), now finished off very professionally.  Newly added bathroom (with heated tile floor) is a few steps away in the unfinished basement.  Washer/dryer/iron & ironing board also in the basement, and Amanda generously offered to let me use them.  Beautiful yard and back deck, vegetable garden, quiet street, lovely neighborhood, ample parking.  All the great reviews are true, and the best part is Amanda – a wonderful friend and terrific host!"
25002,323602,2011-06-20,520447,Richard,"Quiet, clean, mellow location and space.  Slept like a rock each night after I taught class all day.  I arrived to a fresh bowl of fruit and yummy brownies. She has organic coffee in the room, wi-fi. cable and a clean bathroom with a heated floor.  I only saw her once during the entire stay. "
25002,329675,2011-06-23,472495,Bronwyn,"Fabulous. Very comfortable (the bed was particularly good), clean and quiet, with extra touches that made my stay in Seattle so good. Amanda was a wonderful host: friendly, respectful and very helpful. Highly recommended. "
25002,340848,2011-06-28,346867,Brian,"Amanda was a great host and was extremely organized and helpful the entire time. When I arrived, she had delicious brownies ready along with instructions for everything in the apartment. I also changed plans at the last-minute and had a friend stay with me as well, and she was more than happy to accommodate. I highly recommend staying here as it's a great place and Amanda is an awesome host."
25002,356255,2011-07-06,328781,Sabine,"Large, spacious accommodation, well equipped with attention to detail, in a charming quiet neighbourhood, within walking distance to supermarket and bus stops. Amanda went out of her way to make me feel comfortable. My best airbnb experience so far."
25002,371816,2011-07-14,467369,Sheau,"Amanda is the most wonderful and thoughtful host!  We stayed there for 8 days with our two year old and that was the best accommodation experience we had in our two month trip.  Very kids friendly, and Amanda even left some toys and books out for us.  Very clean and comfortable room and bathroom.   Will definitely stay there again.

"
25002,376876,2011-07-16,749519,Amy Jo,"We had a great time staying in Amanda's home. It was really like a home away from home. We arrived to brownies and a bowl of cherries! There's a hairdryer and shampoo and even tampons in case you find yourself in that situation. Tons of closet and drawer space, and even an iron to press your clothes. There was always parking on the street and the neighborhood is very cute. If I ever return to Seattle I would definitely consider staying here again. The price is certainly right for all that you get! "
25002,389570,2011-07-22,459611,Charles,Great little spot.  The bus is not far.  It is like you have your own apartment.  
25002,392140,2011-07-23,414831,Annie,"Just needed to stay near Ballard as we were heading to the wonderful downtown area for dinner while passing through the area. Amanda's place was perfect.  Clean, comfortable, private  and quiet. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
25002,399671,2011-07-26,851868,Lynn,Amanda's apt was exactly as described and her brownies are perfect.  She has everything you could need and the place is immaculate and very comfortable. 
25002,400734,2011-07-27,16925,Sanya And,"We had a brief stay at Amanda's place, but it was great all the while. We were so glad Amanda allowed our late check-in as we were just coming in town from a late flight.

The place is welcoming and for such a small little space, it is well-equipped for guests. We appreciated the fresh fruit and treats that were left for us. In addition, the place is very clean and looks like it has been recently renovated.

Overall, it was calm and private just what we needed after a long flight and one of us being ill!

Thanks for letting us stay at your lovely space!"
25002,411010,2011-08-01,719553,Barbara,"A very welcome alternative to hotels.  Quiet, clean, comfortable - great 'welcome' brownies!  The only trick is the on-street parking.  If you rent a car for your visit, make sure it's a small one."
25002,417989,2011-08-03,415377,Jessica,We had a very relaxing weekend staying here. Perfect location. 
25002,453189,2011-08-17,141021,Deborah,"Wonderful cozy room with all that you need.  The location was great, close to Ballard and a great coffee shop.  We loved being able to water the garden and have fresh veggies and dahlia's ia in our room.  Amanda was super friendly, even though we only got to meet her at the end of our stay.  We will definitely be back and have already referred a friend to stay there!!  Thank you"
25002,464941,2011-08-22,554665,Alison,"What a great little space! I arrived to fresh fruit, flowers & home made brownies! A perfect space to have a home away from home with all of the amenities. Amanda was a fantastic host & made my first airbnb experience a super postive one, looking forward to returning!"
25002,497200,2011-09-03,737188,Carol,Amanda's place was perfect for us.  Quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking.  A great location with many places to go eat or grab a cup of coffee.  She was very friendly and her brownies were delicious.  The flowers and bowl of fruit were a wonderful touch to the room.  Thank you Amanda for making our stay very comfortable and feel like home. 
25002,522649,2011-09-12,666872,Marjo,Apartment was very cosy and comfortable and the neighbourhood peaceful. Two bus stops nearby with an easy distance to downtown. For some Ballard might be too distant from downtown but if you like to stay in a residential area and experience more than just tourist attractions - it's the perfect spot. 
25002,556011,2011-09-22,742259,Robert,"We had a very pleasant stay at Amanda's while visiting our daughter in Seattle. Well supplied, clean and comfortable accommodations. "
25002,585739,2011-10-01,988079,Jim,"I enjoyed a comfortable 3 day stay at Amanda's B&B.  The location was perfect for me and close to coffee shops and bus lines.  She offered the use of her deck and back yard in addition to the B&B space provided.  
she is a friendly and knowledgeable host.  Amazing brownies!   I'll stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.

25002,610971,2011-10-09,122417,Cecilia,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful experience staying here!!! Amanda was soooooo nice, warm, and respectful. The perfect host. The room is exactly as it is pictured - lovely, clean, and welcoming. The Ballard neighborhood is great - good food and a nice yoga studio downtown. Ideal for folks who do not want to get tangled up in the traffic and noise of downtown. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. (FYI - Amanda bakes killer brownies!!!) "
25002,721574,2011-11-15,1302082,Betsy,"This home is comfy, cozy, and exactly as advertised. Great place to stay if you are wanting to be near the action but not in the heart of downtown, only 5 min from historic Ballard & 15 min from Pike Place Market. Two thumbs up!"
25002,739136,2011-11-22,782148,Tejas,"Amanda was a great host and we had a great time at her place. She also baked us warm muffins, Thanks Amanda"
25002,765404,2011-12-05,98431,Kristin,"What is not to like? The location is outstanding, within walking distance of everywhere you will want to go and everything you will want to see. The hostesses are superbly kind, very welcoming and incredibly accommodating, helping us make sure the space would work for our two-year old daughter who would sleep in the portable crib we brought for her (and who historically has not done well sleeping in the same room as us - they gave as what we needed to put up a little ""wall"" made from a bed sheet). 

The apartment is comfortable, well-appointed and clean. The bed is cozy, firm but not hard with a super comfy comforter. The bathroom is clean and adorable, and we wanted to spend more time in it just hanging out (gotta love those radiant heat floors). The welcome brownies and fruit bowl were a really nice additional touch. We cannot wait to go back; our two-year old talks about the Seattle apartment all the time. Thanks so much for having us!"
25002,770310,2011-12-07,803526,Ivar Nelson & Phoebe,"What a nice surprise this gem was. Amanda and Luisa have clearly thought through every aspect of providing a refuge for travelers.  Clean to a fault, my usual slovenliness stood out in sharp contrast to the meticulousness of the accommodations.   I'll not indulge in the effusiveness of my full gratitude lest I make this place never available again.  Nevertheless, highest recommendations.  "
25002,785619,2011-12-14,1389392,Cindy,"We got to stay at Amanda's 4 nights. The room was nice and clean, she had extra ammenities that you wouldn't get at a hotel, easy to find, lots of great food and entertainment in the area, communication was GREAT. We are Very Grateful!"
25002,801917,2011-12-23,1364879,Ankur,she is such an awesome host! Very helpful and the place was exactly what we were looking for. It is in a quiet neighborhood yet close to almost everything you need to get started/setup.

25002,820406,2012-01-01,1455148,Toni,"I booked a stay for my parents who visited for the holidays. Amanda was excellent with all communications. After their weary late night arrival they were greeted with a well lit walkway, seamless check-in, and decadent brownies.  They stayed for a week,  enjoyed all the amenities, and request to stay here when they visit again. "
25002,850233,2012-01-08,1530523,David,"Amanda was an excellent host and incredible individual. The basement floor had a great amount of privacy and quiet to match a peaceful residential neighborhood. Amanda clearly enjoys the process of hosting, making your stay warm and memorable."

25002,909367,2012-02-08,1612356,Klaus,"Amanda was the perfect host! She was very friendly, uncomplicated, helpful and diligent. We even found an ice scraper on our car after a frosty night! Her home is located in a charming neighbourhood, not far away from Green Lake, which is well suited for exercise and relaxation. Hopefully we will be meeting each other again!

25002,920707,2012-02-14,207469,Caitlin,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our weekend in Seattle. The ""apartment"" was very cozy and comfortable and Amanda was a great hostess. Ballard is now one of our favorite areas in Seattle and Amanda's recommendations in town did not dissapoint!
Will definitely stay here again for our next visit."
25002,933187,2012-02-20,110487,Demetrius,"Amanda Guyler...  what a wonderful being and thoughtful host.  My best airbnb experience, thus far.  The apartment is C-L-E-A-N and cozy.  The bed is ""off-the-charts"" comfortable.  The brownies are from the place in heaven where angels just bake brownies all day!!  =)    Amanda's apartment is a wonderful way to begin and end your days in Seatlle.  I happily and highly recommend."

25002,1014883,2012-03-18,1884627,Katie,"Great stay--clean and comfortable, perfect value, nice neigborhood, easy parking, and I had everything I needed plus some!  The separate entrance/key allowed for plenty of privacy, but I was still glad that I got the chance to talk with Amanda and get to know her for a bit as well.  Amanda was very friendly, and she had excellent recommendations for a great place (Sunset Hill Park) to go for a walk during the unexpected sunny afternoon in Seattle.  Thanks so much for everything!"

We met some problems during our stay, but Amanda was really helpful. The house is located at a quiet neighborhood, which is not far away from downtown. Love this experience! "
25002,1100313,2012-04-09,1144743,Katie,"Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful! We spent eight days in gorgeous Seattle (and it really was gorgeous - beautiful weather!). Amanda was a fantastic host. We had yummy brownies and fruit waiting for us when we arrived. We were able to use the washer and dryer in the basement, just a few steps outside of our room. That was a huge help for us and really cut down on the amount of clothing we packed for our trip.

The room was the perfect size for us - all three of us (two adults and one child) had plenty of room to spread out. There was definitely ample storage - two dressers, one desk, two nightstands, and a large closet with room for shoes, luggage and hanging clothes (hangers included!).

Both beds (the queen bed and pull-out love-seat) were very comfortable. I never sleep well my first night away from home, but I slept like a baby on the very comfy queen bed. My husband's contribution to this review: The heated floor in the bathroom was awesome!!! Oh, and the water pressure in the shower rocks!

Having a refrigerator and microwave in the room was definitely a plus! They were both put to good use with leftovers from Delancy (fantastic pizza place - try the bittersweet chocolate chip cookie with gray salt for dessert) and Honore (delightful bakery - try everything). We had no leftovers from The Fat Hen, but we did eat brunch at a table next to Penn Badgley and Zoe Kravitz! We quite enjoyed having such excellent dining options within easy walking distance.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience. Great host, great room, great neighborhood, great city!"

25002,1166667,2012-04-23,1681807,Lura,"We chose Amanda's rental because it was in the same neighborhood as our friends that we were visiting. Now that we have stayed there, I would choose it just because it is an amazing place to stay! We arrived to a cute, newly remodeled, very clean room with yummy homemade brownies awaiting us! Amanda chatted with us on several occasions and we hope to visit this wonderful guest again! The location was perfect for us. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet with lots of parking available in addition to her driveway. We rode our bikes to the Burke-Gilman trail and rode for hours. We ran to the zoo and around Green Lake which was beautiful. Thank you Amanda for everything!"
25002,1191947,2012-04-28,2096899,Thomas,"I have been to Seattle a few times before, but always for work. This time my fiance and I got to do some proper exploring. Starting with Amanda's neighborhood. Ballard is amazing! So glad we chose her guestroom. High in the hills, Ballard is really charming and its clear that those who live there understand what a great spot they have. Mountain views and lush foliage are everywhere. As well as many local independent shops and restaurants. Amanda recommended the local bakery Honore and it was amazing. Macaroons to go for the plane ride home and the best croissant I've ever had. And speaking of tasty baked goods, when we arrived at Amanda's, there were fresh brownies waiting for us. We ate them immediately, of course, and they were excellent. No doubt we will stay there again whenever we visit Seattle again. Which will hopefully be soon. We had a great time. Thanks Amanda and Luisa."
25002,1199631,2012-04-30,1702981,Christine,"Amanda was an excellent hostess.  Her space was comfortable, cheerful, and had everything I needed.  I would love to stay there again."
25002,1220469,2012-05-03,1651874,Monica,"My daughter and I arrived late to Amanda's place and what a joy it was to feel welcomed by some warm lights at the entry and some home made brownies awaiting us inside. We were a little road weary so the thoughtfulness was even more appreciated! We found her place easily - even in the dark!

The suite is welcoming, clean and nicely appointed. I would stay again any time we are in Seattle again!"
25002,1248819,2012-05-08,2173470,Duane,"Had a lovely stay at Amanda's this past weekend. Clean, comfortable, quiet. Location is super walkable to Delancey's for pizza, Fat Hen for breakfast, Honore for French treats and, with a little longer walk, anything in downtown Ballard.

Honestly, you can stop searching for your Ballard apartment and go ahead and book Amanda's."
25002,1266682,2012-05-12,2092421,Jody,"Amanda's place is clean, comfortable, inviting, and private.  It is within walking distance to a bus that will take you downtown in about 15-20 minutes depending on traffic.   You can also walk to some shops and a delicious bakery!  This is a wonderful option if you want to stay in a quiet area, take some walks in the neighborhood and get a good night's rest.  There is also a refrigerator and a nice big desk.  The water pressure in the shower is very nice, too.  It's clear to me that Amanda knows what a traveler needs and has thought carefully about the organization of her space, and what to include in her space-- (the alarm clock was very helpful, the shampoo and conditioner, the hair dryer, etc.).  I would stay here again.  "
25002,1297055,2012-05-17,2348245,Darcy,"Amanda's place was very nice and comfortable, and she was a great host. Since I didn't spend much time there I never actually ran into her, but she left a nice note with instructions and a place of brownies! Very quiet, private, and spacious room. "
25002,1310731,2012-05-20,1814035,Toni,Amanda was a terrific host and her place is warm and welcoming.  Thanks for that awesome assortment of fruit and the amazing brownies.  Loved staying there!
25002,1381075,2012-05-30,683800,Nancy,"Wonderful neighborhood.  Spring is breathtakingly beautiful in Ballard.  The apartment was so clean, and newly and attractively finished.  Amanda is a warm and gracious host.  We enjoyed wine on her large deck with friends.  Great to have laundry facilities too.  Note to those who need darkness to sleep: the eastern exposure is bright very early in the morning in May.  I hung our coats on hangers on the door and window frames to give us a few extra hours of sleep.  We didn't have a car and there were two bus lines that stopped very nearby - very convenient.  Would definitely return.  Thanks!"
25002,1428100,2012-06-06,2393597,Herman,"Amanda's place felt like a fully furnished studio apartment. The location is within walking distance to all of the unique things to see in Ballard. Amanda gives wonderful privacy and the room is very cozy, clean and homey. Parking was never a problem, as the driveway is always available. I would definitely stay here again."
25002,1440492,2012-06-08,1581651,Karen,"This was a very comfortable room in a quiet neighborhood.  The owner was very accommodating.  Yes, there were the brownies and yes I ate them all.  A plus for me was the nice bathroom with a tub."
25002,1469310,2012-06-12,1329445,Leah,"Cozy, charming, welcoming...wonderful! Great house, great neighborhood. Amanda is very sweet! And the heated bathroom floors were incredible too. "
25002,1485296,2012-06-15,2350923,Susan,"Amanda has a very clean and comfortable downstairs bedroom that comfortably aoccommodated my two daughters and myself. The privacy was appreciated and Ballard was a great neighborhood to be in. It was close to a beautiful park where we jogged each morning and the bus to Seattle was close by and convenient. My daughters loved the home made brownied that Amanda left for our arrival at night, so it is a great place to stay."
25002,1502356,2012-06-18,1219591,Ralph,A really good  place to stay with a wonderful host who was extremely helpful and kind. Highly recommended.
25002,1566720,2012-06-26,2333919,Beth,"Amanda is very nice and very accommodating. On top of offering us her comfy, cozy and private studio apartment, she placed a plate of homemade brownies and a welcome note in the room! :)  

This place was a perfect homebase for our 4-day stay in Seattle!  We were able to get to and from all parts of the city quickly.  It is nicely stocked with everything you might need. As parents of a young baby, we especially appreciated having access to a washer and dryer!   "
25002,1611576,2012-07-02,2488508,Valentin,"We had a wonderful time!  Andy and I were in Seattle for his first visit.  We loved the quiet neighborhood and the hospitality.  It was so great to sleep in, go for a run, have a shower in a super-clean bathroom, and feel like we were a young couple in a cute neighborhood.  A nice place sets such a tone for a trip!"
25002,1646904,2012-07-07,1813476,Ken,"A lovely quiet place to stay. We were greeted with a plate of  the now famous Amanda brownies, a bowl of fresh fruit and were able to savor some off the the peas and lettuces growing in the garden during our stay (yummy). It is a nice quiet and friendly neighborhood with the #28 bus to downtown (20/25 minutes) just a few blocks away made getting into the city ideal. It stops near the Seattle Center, Pike Market, Pioneer Square and easy to connect with the light rail system. While we didn't have much of a chance to sit and chat with Amanda she is a vary warm and friendly host and took care of anything we might have needed. It was a great visit to Seattle made even better by our stay at Amanda's place"
25002,1660120,2012-07-08,2471316,Priya,"Amanda was a fantastic host! The place was pristine and beautiful, just as described. She had every amenity conveniently located in the room with complete privacy. Amanda shared lots of useful Seattle knowledge and encouraged us to reach out to her if we needed anything. Highly recommend and will definitely stay with her again when I'm back in the Seattle area! "
25002,1716171,2012-07-16,1666097,Violet,My mom and I took a short vacation to Seattle and decided to go with this beautiful studio. I love the neighborhood.  Amanda is a great host!! She pays close attention to  the fine details and was very helpful with any of our needs. I will definitely be visiting someday again and will look to stay with her!
25002,1759433,2012-07-21,210156,Luke,"Fantastic location - quaint, stylish, coffee shops, bakery, breakfast joints! Amanda was an incredible host and was very accommodating to our two year old. Close enough to Seattle but just far enough away from the hustle and bustle. We enjoyed Green Lake, the Fremont Troll, the Ballard locks and much more, all which were a couple miles away. I would recommend her place in a heartbeat and will definitely think about her place for our next trip to Seattle. You will not be disappointed. "
25002,1787906,2012-07-24,2423254,Kristen,A charming place to stay in Ballard.  Very cozy and nicely decorated.  We had everything we needed
25002,1808248,2012-07-26,2960940,Thomas,Amanda is good and gracious host and the apartment very comfortable. And the location is excellent/quiet neighborhood.
25002,1826351,2012-07-29,2197097,Mary,"It was great staying with Amanda...I felt like I was at my daughter""s home!  Everything was clean and pleasant with many small amenities that you couln;t get in a hotel..And of couse..there were Brownies "
25002,1847881,2012-07-31,2260887,Jeffrey,The room was lovely and very private.  We arrived to a plate of home made brownies.  Amanda was a very nice host.
25002,1874148,2012-08-03,763453,Sabina,"Amanda is the most gracious host. We thouroughly enjoyed staying at her beautiful apartment. It's comfy, clean and has everything one might need. The perfect hub from which to explore Seattle. 
And yes, her brownies are to die for. "
25002,1882683,2012-08-04,763453,Sabina,Amanda's the perfect host! 
25002,1922923,2012-08-08,534535,Stephan,"Our stay at Amanda's beautiful apartment was overwhelming. She is the perfect host, welcoming and helpful with advice on all aspects that travellers might need to find their way around the neighborhood and the city. The description of the apartment is fully accurate, everything is tidy and cozy. And there is even a brand new huge flat screen TV with HD (although you probably won't find much time to use it, since there is so much to discover in the area). A highlight for us was sitting in Amanda's backyard and just watch the day go by in this quiet surroundings. Thank you so much, Amanda!"
25002,1954230,2012-08-12,2140481,James,"Our stay with Amanda was absolutely perfect. She greeted my girlfriend upon arrival, and offered to move her car in order to make space for ours in front of her house. We were welcomed with a beautiful, cozy room with a new swiveling flat-screen tv, homemade brownies, and all of the amenities a hotel would never provide (toothpaste, advil, tea, kettle, microwave, fridge). We also asked for a wine/bottle opener and Amanda provided us with one almost immediately. She was an amazing host with a beautifully-located house. Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful and I would recommend Amanda's place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. Hopefully we'll be back!"
25002,2025575,2012-08-18,3251257,Laura,"The location of Amanda's place is great and the place itself is very cute, quiet and private... She left peaches from her neighbour's yard and slices 
of fresh zucchini bread out for us (a nice touch!!) and the best part was that she was able to accommodate us even though if was fairly last minute. 
The bed was very comfortable and there's wi-fi and a tv with lots of channels. ... my husband and I were on an overnight trip to Seattle and we 
wanted to stay in Ballard... it was our first Air BnB experience and we were very happy. All in all Amanda's place is highly recommended... Thanks Amanda !!"
25002,2038837,2012-08-20,890237,Micaela,"Amanda's place is so cute and homey.  There were even fresh homemade zucchini bread and peaches from a neighbor's tree waiting for us when we arrived in the evening!  Amanda kept good communication before and during our trip via airbnb messages.  I felt safe and welcome here and would love to come back.  (All this, despite not even meeting Amanda!  Unfortunately, our timing did not align, and I was busy during the weekend I stayed there with a wedding and related festivities.)"
25002,2081235,2012-08-24,1459474,David,"This place was in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Seattle. Fruit trees and vegetable gardens everywhere. Close to public transportation to get downtown and within walking distance of coffee shops and restaurants. The bedroom was beautiful (nicer than a lot of hotels we stayed in) and we had access to laundry, a refrigerator and Amanda's backyard. Amanda was super nice and helpful. I highly recommend this place to anyone that like low key and city city environments."
25002,2109736,2012-08-27,2871196,Sandra,Nice comfortable room with all the amenities in a quiet neighborhood. 
25002,2213622,2012-09-06,611768,Gwendolyn,"From the moment I walked in, it was clear why Amanda is a Superhost: fresh cut flowers from her garden were in a vase on the desk beside a plate of fresh-baked homemade brownies and a handwritten personal note welcoming me.  Wow!  Add to that a spotless, cozy, welcoming room, a meticulously kept bathroom, fresh towels laid out, a pitcher of filtered water, and instructions on how to make myself at home noting everything from wifi information to instructions on how to adjust the temperature of the heating floor in the bathroom and more... it was clear Amanda had thought of everything.  This turned out to be true with every aspect of my stay: check-in + out couldn't have been easier, the bed was very comfortable, and Amanda was incredibly responsive.  Her place is exactly as described and pictured, and that's a good thing.  What's more, the neighborhood is charming - definitely check out historic Ballard if you get a chance - and a quick walk to a bus stop that'll take you right downtown, making it very accessible.  All in all, a terrific stay, no downsides whatsoever.  I *highly* recommend Amanda and her place!  "
25002,2273927,2012-09-14,1677317,Renee,"We had a great stay and really appreciated the fantastic job Amanda has done with this space.  It is exactly as portrayed in the photos and very clean.  Ballard is a great neighbourhood and we were easily able to access public transport.
We really enjoyed the advice Amanda gave us on places to visit and the brownies and plums she gave us during the week.  While Amanda was regularly around to ask for advice we also had complete privacy when we wanted it.
As travellers on a seven week trip we also really appreciated being able to wash and dry our clothes easily."
25002,2343893,2012-09-19,3045934,Paula,Very comfortable space. Clean and quiet.
25002,2417212,2012-09-26,2350058,Blaze & Paul,My Husband and I love Seattle and Amanda’s place was great – everything as we imagined. We arrived to fresh cut flowers in a vase & plumbs from her garden and a plate of homemade brownies. Amanda had also left us a welcome note explaining all the details. There was also fresh towels laid out for us and a pitcher of filtered water. The fridge & microwave sure came in handy as did the use of the washing machine & dryer. Amanda’s place was exactly as described and I would not hesitate in recommending her place and Ballard. It’s a great location. 
25002,2510531,2012-10-05,861806,Erica,"Amanda's studio was perfect for our nine-day stay. It was easy to get to, was spotless inside, and had everything we needed. When we first walked in, a plate of brownies, fresh-cut flowers, and a sweet note from Amanda greeted us. Amanda opened her lovely backyard for our pleasure, and made some nice recommendations for lunch and dinner. By the way, go to Delancey for artisan pizza and The Fat Hen for a dish of baked eggs (both around the corner)! Overall, if you want a quiet, clean, and easily accessible studio, come here!"
25002,2538245,2012-10-08,92250,Juan,"Wonderful, well appointed room (even got to watch Barça - Real Madrid in HD!) that was quiet and cozy.  Amanda was warm and welcoming, making it the most pleasant experience to spend a few nights away with our little 7 months old along for the ride!"
25002,2586253,2012-10-12,1316383,Brant,"Amanda's place is awesome! When we arrived, we were greeted by a fresh plate of delicious brownies and a friendly note from our hostess. The accomodations were clean, quiet and easily accessible with plently of street parking. My wife and I could not have found a better place to stay during our visit to Seattle."
25002,2620925,2012-10-15,1702981,Christine,This is my favorite place to stay in Ballard.  Amanda's basement apartment has everything I need and she is a gracious host.
25002,2749069,2012-10-29,2623460,Rochelle,"Sweet little studio, with super comfy bed and towels, fresh flowers, and brownies waiting for us. Amanda was easy-going and made it easy to book and stay there! We could even park in the driveway, what a treat! Loved it."
25002,2847518,2012-11-09,1931187,Joanna,"There is nothing that I can write that will say what hasn't been said about Amanda's guest suite by the previous 131 reviews!  Yes, read that again, 131 reviews.  Amanda came to my rescue when I experienced a hiccup in my travel, and in the cold Seattle night, she called me to work out a plan, which made me feel welcomed and supported.  Amanda is absolutely down to earth, mellow, thoughtful of a host - Awesome communication, awesome interaction, awesome outcomes.  131 reviews, ok?"
25002,2883540,2012-11-14,2942175,Meg,"We wish we could give Amanda 10 stars!  The apartment was clean, well furnished and had sweet little personal touches that can't be beat!  When we arrived we were greeted with beautiful flowers from her garden and a plate of amazing brownies! There was a little holder that had organic teas and coffees and an electric water heater for a quick cup of warmth.  A mini fridge proved useful as well (do you know how many hotels DON'T have a mini fridge these days?!?)  She lives within walking distance (5-10 minute stroll at most) of wonderful little local restaurants and is close to anything else you might need.  Amanda also let us park in her driveway which was wonderful because we learned we aren't good street parkers :) Oh, and the use of her washer and dryer was great so I didn't have to go home with 5 days of dirty clothes!

We got to talk to Amanda a few times as well and her hospitality, kindness and knowledge of local places is great! I text her a few times during our stay to find out where something in particular was and she always promptly responded with exactly what we wanted to know.  

Overall I would highly recommend her sweet little apartment to everyone I know! "
25002,2944584,2012-11-22,3635722,Craig,"Great spot, easy to find, and the best brownies were awaiting for us as we came in out of the rain.  We ate 'em before dinner.  Amanda was prompt in responding to the reservation request, I spoke with her directly over the phone, she was very accommodating to any of my requests.
Thanks, Amanda."
25002,3023220,2012-12-04,1355413,Courtney,"Yep, it's great! Read the other reviews, add them up and it equals awesome. 
Everything is as advertised - even the cleanliness! I am perhaps a bit OCD about cleanliness (clutter -not so much) but the place was immaculate, even the bathroom. (Side note: the heated floors in the bathroom are such a wonderful addition. Didn't know I was missing them until Amanda's place).
Unfortunately it was such a busy weekend that I didn't get to meet Amanda or Luisa but they made it so easy and wonderful.
We also loved walking to the Fat Hen for breakfast one morning: the egg bakes are simple and delicious.
And of course the brownies are amazing, particularly after a long day of travel. :)"
25002,3043286,2012-12-08,4170267,Anne,"We loved our stay at Amanda's!  The room was comfortable and had everything we could possibly have needed.  VERY comfy bed.  We were there for only a very short time, but it was the perfect place to stop to catch our breath and relax a bit.  Looking forward to staying again sometime soon when we return to Seattle for a longer visit. :)  "

We appreciated all the little amenities -- like toothpaste, shampoo, and conditioner in the bathroom. And fresh coffee in the morning. The studio is very cozy, clean, quiet, and private in a charming neighborhood. We hope to stay there again soon!"
25002,3111405,2012-12-18,2697736,Kelli,We had a great weeklong stay at Amanda's place. We came and went as we pleased and had access to just about anything we could need. She's really got a great downstairs suite going on...and I'm loving the heated bathroom floor:) Amanda is obviously a very experienced and talented hostess.
25002,3145458,2012-12-24,3985130,Chris,"Just returned from a 3 day stay at Amanda's in Ballard and I think the delicious brownies we're solely responsible for averting the Mayan's predicted apocalypse.  The space is warm,private and cozy and she's a very thoughtful host.  I hope her place is available the next time I come to seattle."
25002,3299666,2013-01-07,4225114,Lew,"My wife and I chose this location because of its closeness to our daughter's house. We loved the heated floor in the bathroom.  We were there for a week. It was convenient to have a mini fridge, a microwave, an electric water pot for making tea and coffee. The location was nice and made it easy to get around. Nice neighborhood, lots of restaurants, Walgreens and Safeway close by. We will definitely stay again at Amanda's when we visit Seattle next time. We highly recommend her place.

Amanda was very hospitable and checked-in to see if her guests were well!  We definitely enjoyed the soft, mint decor of the studio space and great amenities such as the microwave & kettle, a lovely selection of teas, mini fridge, wifi access, and widescreen cable television.  Other perks included a great desk & lounging area, a lovely double bed, and a charming bathroom with laminate floor heating :-).

25002,3444772,2013-01-30,4085538,Nathalie,"This is a really lovely, cozy, quiet space next to a wonderful Seattle neighborhood. Amanda was a great host, very accommodating to our check in/check out schedule, and even made us brownies (which were delicious)! The bed is really comfortable and the room has all the conveniences of a hotel. Parking was easy (there's a driveway) and the main drag of Ballard is only a 5-10 minute drive away or a nice 20-30 minute walk. We would definitely stay here again!"
25002,3468601,2013-02-04,1451349,Nancy,"We had a delightful stay in this location.  Amanda was a gracious host, calling to ensure we knew where to get the key because she wasn't home.  She left us a plate of delicious brownies upon our arrival.  It is a very walkable and delightful neighborhood.  The room was exactly as the pictures, and the heated floor in the bathroom was great.  We rode the train up so we didn't have a car, but the bus transportation gets you downtown in about 15 minutes.  Overall great stay."
