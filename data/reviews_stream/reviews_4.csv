456040,10109441,2014-01-31,7274055,Shing,"Although I got delayed in arriving, Chantel had already advised me how to let myself in, so it was a breeze checking in.  Since it was late, I did not get a chance to introduce myself until the next day.

Easy parking on the street in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The entrance was well lit with a motion detector light.  The place has a separate living room with a large couch and easy chair.  The kitchen was clean and convenient with a full-sized refrigerator and gas stove.  Coffee and tea were available.  The bedroom was cosy and the queen bed was very comfortable.

Overall feel was very cute, clean and comfortable.  The only negative I could think of was that the ceilings were low, so if you are a really tall person, you may not like it.  But I had no trouble.

Chantel and Zak are delightful people and I enjoyed talking to them.  I would highly recommend their home and would definitely stay there again if I could."
456040,10134897,2014-02-02,4061328,Matlena,We had lovely stay at Chantel's place! The space is great and very warm in these cold months which was lovely. There was a nice living room area and great little bedroom. Perfect size and close to the city by car. Great value for a great space!
456040,10293893,2014-02-11,8587297,Tana,"Very spacious and in such a convenient, trendy area! The price was spot on. It was so nice having a kitchen to cook a few simple meals in instead of going out all the time. Chantel and Zack were very nice and made me feel right at home. I will certainly stay there again on another visit."
456040,10974117,2014-03-16,8753884,Helen,"Perfect location, very convenient, and very comfortable place to stay. The hosts were very friendly and gracious. As a woman visiting on my own, I felt very secure in both the flat and the neighborhood. I also really appreciated having a kitchen and private entrance so that I could have people over for dinner. I would definitely stay there again - it's a really nice and cosy place, and they're really nice people. Actually I hope to book it again sometime soon!"
456040,24513788,2014-12-29,10606157,Loic,Chantel was extremely helpful during all my stay always promptly answering  my questions and my requests .  I will definitely go back there whenever I am in Seattle . Thank You so Much Chantel !!!
456040,24689680,2015-01-01,8796871,Laura,The neighborhood felt very suburban yet it had lots of venues to visit. The public transportation next to the house is convenient and surprisingly reliable. The room was a good size and the kitchen and the bathroom provided were perfect for those seeking privacy. The teas in the kitchen were all organic and that was a plus also the house pet was really quite and didn't mind strangers.
456040,24885941,2015-01-03,222228,Nina,Chantel's place was ideal for what I needed. Great location and cozy place.  
456040,25000296,2015-01-04,16635464,Stephanie,"The listing was very accurate. Checking in was easy, and both Chantel and her partner greeted us at the door! The basement was spacious and comfortable. "
456040,25121538,2015-01-06,25589734,Kyle,"My wife and I enjoyed our experience. The place was clean and inexpensive for what we got. We were glad to have it available to us at that price since we actually live in the area and had to leave our apartment quickly due to mold. My only complaints would be that I'm 6'2"" and the ceiling was low enough in some areas that my head could hit. Other than that we used the kitchen and it worked great as a temporary kitchen. "
456040,25388852,2015-01-14,25045038,Liliana,"Chantel's place is very comfortable to stay, it was walking distance from the university and the public transportation next to the house is convenient. The room was a good size and the kitchen and the bathroom provided were perfect. Chantel and her husband were very nice and welcoming, we definitely enjoyed our stay there  "
456040,25444761,2015-01-16,20534814,Christi,Very comfortable space with private entrance and full kitchen. Clean and homey. Chantel was gracious and welcoming.
456040,25489109,2015-01-17,21774059,Jackie,Chantel's sweet was an awesome place to stay at! Really close to the bus stop and a walkable distance from the university! My friend and I stayed there the first two days of our trip and chose her suite when we returned to Seattle. She's really friendly and helpful!
456040,25611446,2015-01-20,25505210,Laura,"We had a very comfortable stay. Great location, parking was easy, and our host was very welcoming. Highly recommended!"
456040,25782905,2015-01-25,10786690,Laura,"Chantel's home is amazing. My girlfriend Emily and I only stayed one night, but I wish we stayed our entire trip. The space was huge. Having a private entrance is phenomenal! Also a full kitchen! My girlfriend and I love cooking and kept wishing we could have done more while we were visiting the Pacific Northwest but our other accommodations just didn't allow us to. Also having a private bathroom was fantastic. There were comfy robes and fresh towels. Seriously this place has EVERYTHING YOU NEED. Don't hesitate. This is the place you need to stay in. Stay away from the hustle and bustle of downtown this area is beautiful and quiet. Thank you Chantel!!! "
456040,25879571,2015-01-28,3530608,Viki,"This was a great location in walking distance to 45th Street which has tons of restaurants, walking distance to bus options that take you straight downtown without a transfer, super convenient. Great private set up downstairs with two bedrooms, small kitchen space, living area and bathroom. Had it to ourselves since the other room wasn't rented out but that's certainly not a guarantee. We only saw Zak & Chantel when we checked in but they would've been available if we needed them. We're kind of private and spent a lot of time visiting our niece who lives nearby. Hosts were wonderful about letting her come over for coffee and to visit which made our time together longer and more relaxed. Really appreciated that. Would definitely stay again."
456040,25948904,2015-01-30,20931989,Laura,"Chantel is a fantastic host and her place is lovely!  She has created a restful and comfortable suite, with lots of space, and decorated with objects and images that are a delight to see.  I think that the place reflects an unusual sense of intuition in terms of making it appealing as a guest space. I was really impressed.

Bedroom: soft reading light, good linens, really comfortable mattress, pretty colors.  I peeked into the other room and it was darling in its own way, a really pretty space.  Bathroom: clean, well-equipped, good shower, high quality body wash/shampoo/conditioner provided.  Sitting area: comfortable and sweet, with plenty of magazines to page through. Kitchen: nice bar area where I enjoyed sitting and having some wine; very thoughtfully equipped with everything needed, including a number of nice seasonings, utensils, good pots, etc.... Location: sweet Wallingford, quiet residential area with bungalows and lots to delight the eyes when walking; a few minutes walk away from Greenlake.

456040,26132062,2015-02-04,14250043,Rachel,Chantel was a wonderful host.  She has provided a very comfortable space for people.  We were very busy visiting family and her place was very convenient to everything we needed to do.   I highly recommend her as a host.
456040,26260267,2015-02-08,2041441,Pam,"Chantel welcomed my husband warmly. I had to come a day later and never actually met her, but we communicated easily through emails and texts. The room was as described; the bed comfortable; and the apartment was beautifully furnished. The neighborhood is great--especially Tangletown and Green Lake. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
456040,26454254,2015-02-13,20534814,Christi,"Second time staying with Chantel-and another excellent experience.  It is lovely, quiet, and comfortable."
456040,26602869,2015-02-16,25419823,Jared,"Great neighborhood to stay in. Very close to Greenlake and the Wallingford shopping area. Chantel greeted us at the door with her awesome dog, Echo, and let us be the rest of the stay. Fully stocked kitchen and great little room. Perfect for couples!"
456040,26850609,2015-02-20,27867049,Russeen,"i felt welcome in Zak and Chantel's place.  There was plenty of privacy, but Zak stopped to say hello when he saw me going out for a bike ride.  The bathroom has quality soap and shampoo and the kitchen has spices."
456040,27251296,2015-03-01,24938155,Michael,"Great place, very clean and comfortable.  Quiet neighborhood. Thanks so much!"
456040,27451810,2015-03-04,28434679,Will,very clean place and really nice host
456040,27485262,2015-03-05,8009607,T,"Chantel's basement apartment is comfortable with all the amenities.  I stayed one night (for the second time), showed up in the evening, and left in the morning.  I did make a point to walk to Green Lake that evening for a nice moonlit walk.  I did not see the hosts at all, but did definitely hear them a lot (it's a basement apartment)...not that this bothered me, but be aware of you're looking for quiet.  That said, it worked great and was totally comfortable for me."
456040,27783645,2015-03-11,28455341,Jennifer,"Chantel's place is super comfortable and convenient.  It has a private entrance, which makes early/late entry easy.   The neighborhood is safe and beautiful to walk in.  In the morning I would run to, and around, the lake.  There are lots of nice eating places and shopping very close.  Chantel has done a great job of stocking the rooms with everything you could need.  I would definitely stay here again.  "
456040,27970732,2015-03-15,28975190,Rob,Chantal was very helpful and hospitable. 
456040,28303773,2015-03-22,2808857,Conny,"The basement suite is about 10 minutes walking distance from Green Lake and a short walk to wonderful restaurants and coffee shops in a nice quiet neighourhood.
We did not meet Chantel, but were greeted by her partner and their deabeautiful husky.
We liked the personalized door sign and did not mind sharing the suite with another guest even so we must have missed that fact in the discription.
Allergy sufferers beware of the very strong mold smell for all others the room is a bargain in Seattte."
456040,28969364,2015-04-01,27870162,Christine,"Chantel met us at the door and was very helpful and friendly. She even took the time to introduce my boys to her dog! Her home was clean, well kept, and centrally located for the purpose of our trip."
456040,29080933,2015-04-03,29131289,Gretchen,"Cozy space in a nice location - close to the interstate, quiet, easy to find.  We were perfectly content to enjoy Chantel's well-stocked bookcase one evening and roam farther afield the next.    

We shared the suite with another guest but didn't feel at all crowded.  You do hear people upstairs from time to time, though we weren't bothered by it.  The bed was very comfortable.  I'd certainly stay there again."
456040,29124995,2015-04-04,27439986,Eric,Neat space in Seattle with all you could need for a short or long stay. Thanks to Chantel for a speedy response and to air bnb for the easy way to arrange accommodation. Much nicer than staying in a cookie cutter hotel.
456040,29409956,2015-04-07,25244641,Nate,The house was clean and having access to a kitchen was great. Located in a beautiful neighbor. I would stay again. 
456040,30186584,2015-04-19,25941342,Leonard,Our room and the common area were very neat and clean. Supplies were plentiful and the bed (queen) was very comfortable. On your ten minute walk to Green Lake you can stop at Zoka's coffee house for a delicious cup of coffee. We'll definitely be back on our next trip to Seattle.
456040,30477808,2015-04-22,3530608,Viki,"Chantel communicated that she'd be away during our stay but neighbor, Marie, was wonderful. Have stayed here once before. Cozy living room/kitchen area to visit with our niece who lives nearby and not feel we're in anyone's way. Convenient location to Wallingford/Freemont and near Ballard, as well. Great parking. "
456040,30629587,2015-04-25,16517595,Lisa,"My husband and I visited our son who studies in Seattle. We enjoyed the 3 nights staying at Chantel's, Chantel and her husband Zak are great hosts, they gave us total privacy and along with great community. Their home is very nice, clean and homey. And that it's so convenience to connect to the downtown by only 4, 5 minutes walking to the bus stop. My husband and I could easily visit around the city besides meeting with our son during these few days. They also letted us earlier checked in and later checked out, it's very sweet of them. No doubt I would recommend Chantel and Zak's home if you are looking for a neat, quiet and homey place to stay for visiting Seattle. Thank you so much, Chantel and Zak!  : ) "
456040,30750835,2015-04-26,12620049,Celia,"Hi, 
The room in the suite was just how described. It was nice and private, easy to get in and in a great neighborhood. 
We did not see the host, but is was not necessary as she provided all the instructions and information before hand. 
If I return to Seattle, i will stay here again!"
456040,31225290,2015-05-03,13010659,Bekki,"Beautiful neighborhood, lovely suite. Quiet, convenient. I would stay again."
456040,31677799,2015-05-08,7657221,Alex,"Chanel was a great host and kept me informed of details for arrival. The space was clean and enjoyable. 
"
456040,31811557,2015-05-10,11344365,Ying,"Chantel's place is perfect. Very convenient to go to the popular spots in Seattle. The house itself is very cute and homy. You will feel at home. It's close to the Green Lake park and I had a very nice morning run during my stay. Even though I didn't meet Chantel in person, she is a super nice host, very responsive and thoughtful. I will definitely recommend her place if you have a stay in Seattle. -Ying"
456040,32090471,2015-05-13,31073460,Pietro,"The place was very nice and cozy, clean and spacious. The room is in a basement separated from the host so you can have your privacy; the bed is big and comfortable and the bathroom clean and with everything that you could need. Also the neighborhood is full of green and quiet, a perfect place for an evening walk. 
Chantel was a very pleasant and discreet host. 
I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Seattle. 
"
456040,32205325,2015-05-15,32844326,Isabella,"Chantel and her husband were very friendly! On my check-out day, I had some problem finding the next place to stay, so Chantel offered me to hang around the house until I resolved my problem!
The house is very close to Greenlake, and a bunch of cool restaurants!

Great hosts! :)"
456040,32712101,2015-05-20,7332687,Lea,"Excellent place to land in Seattle! A+ for everything. Location in particular was fantastic. Great hostess, clean, cute bedroom, lovely to have access to kitchen and laundry machines. We were able to easily catch a bus heading wherever we wanted. Would love to stay again in the future!"
456040,32802920,2015-05-21,3029106,Victoria,"The room was lovely, in a basement suite with a kitchen and bathroom. The neighborhood is excellent with many shops and restaurants located close by. I didn't meet Chantel, but my stay was fine."
456040,32859533,2015-05-22,2080246,Chen,Sweet room and friendly host :) 
456040,32889240,2015-05-23,29379081,Alexander,"My girlfriend and I had an excellent 1 night stay with Chantelle. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet her, but very much enjoyed the room; it was comfortable and well appointed. We loved the awesome location--super close to Green Lake and also all the awesome spots in Wallingford and Fremont."
456040,32994929,2015-05-24,11431389,Dominica,"This was my second stay with Chantel in a few weeks' time- I've stayed in both rooms in the guest suite and both are very sweet.  Chantel is very friendly and she and her husband were helpful with any requests I had.  It is important to realize that since there are two independently listed rooms in the suite, you will be sharing common areas (including kitchenette and bathroom) with other random guests- some of whom were more clean and discrete than others.  :)   Overall I think this is a great place to stay, easy access to I-5 but not too close, and easy walking or biking distance to Greenlake.  "
456040,33162507,2015-05-25,3114014,Cristina,We only spend one night in Chantel's place but all was perfect amd ready for us! We felt like home. The suite is really comfortable and the area really quite! I Strongñy recommend it

456040,33580521,2015-05-30,17273140,Christine,"The description was accurate. It was a great stay for my parents. There were other guests in the other room of this house, but it wasn't a problem. I didn't get to meet Chantel in person, but her instructions were clear and she was always quick to respond. The house was clean, warm and cozy. Located in a very good neighborhood and within walking distance to Green Lake."
456040,33740352,2015-05-31,8337748,Wiwin,"I only stay for 1 nite and did not get a chance to meet Chantel personally, but she has been very responsive. I love the comfortable room that she has."
456040,34118025,2015-06-05,20508184,Olivier,"Great experience. Clean room, fully-furnished kitchen, quiet, and near the lake and University district."
456040,34200987,2015-06-06,19439142,Teresa,"Chantel was very easy to communicate with throughout the booking process. The room was clean and there is a bathroom located on the same floor. Chantel wasn't home when we stayed there, but she left a door code that was very easy to use. We would definitely stay with her again."
456040,34457453,2015-06-08,7304672,Christina,"It was a very lovely experience. The posting was accurate and the private room had everything that we needed. We wish we got to spend more time here to explore the neighborhood, but we were in and out a few times throughout the day. The side entrance for the suite made it very convenient to be on the go at all hours. Chantel was a great host that sent us messages to check in while we were out and about. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in the area. "
456040,34613335,2015-06-09,11292149,Elizabeth,"Chantel and Zak were wonderful hosts. The basement suite felt very private and we really liked the location. They were extremely accommodating and even allowed me to walk their adorable husky, Echo. Location was a short drive to downtown Seattle and a short walk from many shops and restaurants. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay with Chantel and Zak again!"
456040,35336539,2015-06-17,34875538,Alex,"Great place! Very accommodating and friendly. No tv, but the bed was comfy and a nice shower and kitchen with all your needs."
456040,35427308,2015-06-18,35569342,Matt,Chantel was great! We were only in town for a quick trip but she made sure she was there to welcome us even after she had given us the door code ahead of time. She also helped us navigate the public transit system from her place so we could meet a friend downtown without having to drive. We wish that we had more time to hang out as the space was great.
456040,35463667,2015-06-19,20039247,Zack,"I did not have a chance to meet Chantel, but the listing was exactly as described and very nice! She was very responsive to my questions, and was very accommodating with my late night arrival. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle! "
456040,35659632,2015-06-21,6918757,Dean,"We had a lovely two nights staying here.  It was quiet, comfortable and within easy walking distance of Greenlake.  We shared the living space and kitchenette with another couple who also happened to be from Minnesota- part of the fun about staying at Airbnb is whom you meet!  It would be easy for us to choose to stay here again.  Thanks Chantel!"

I was very comfortable for three nights, and I definitely recommend it. It was also fairly close to the University of Washington where my son is living. The bus route was also very convenient."
456040,36768078,2015-07-01,17052720,Penny,Chantel was very welcoming. Directions to her place were good. The room nice and location great for us.

456040,38409821,2015-07-15,32953361,Paul,It's good to stay there.
456040,38852813,2015-07-19,34393858,Colette,Chantel's place was very nice and relaxing. It is situated in a very cute neighborhood. Be aware that there is another room that people may be staying in. But this is a wonderful place to stay if you are visiting Seattle.
456040,39376142,2015-07-23,30613610,Jane,"Chantel was very responsive to my queries, and gave good recommendations on the must-see/must-do of Seattle. A pleasant stay overall!"

456040,40458709,2015-07-31,22888399,Arya,Chantel did a great job giving us instructions on how to access the unit as long as what to expect. We shared the suit with another person but never bumped into them during our stay. The suite is very charming and comfortable. It's also in a great location just outside of downtown in a quite neighborhood.
456040,40577738,2015-08-01,4143338,Jolene,The place was easy to find and she left great instructions on how to get in.  Great looking place.

456040,42383775,2015-08-13,31616487,Kristin,"We had a wonderful stay at Chantel's suite.  She came down to greet us when we arrived and was available upstairs if we needed anything (although we had everything we needed!).  The description was accurate, and the neighborhood is great to escape the bustle of downtown Seattle, but also have quick and easy access to it.  We took a lovely stroll around nearby Green Lake - a great area.  

There were other guests staying in the second bedroom of the suite both nights of our stay, but we only briefly ran into one guest.  "
456040,42554052,2015-08-14,10304857,Sydney,Perfect spot to spend the night in Seattle. My husband  took advantage of  the close proximity to Greenlake for a morning run. Would definitely come back if we ever needed to stay in Seattle again!
456040,43478298,2015-08-20,19920950,Jacques," Well   located close to I-5.  Chantel wasn't there for most of our stay, but Zach was very nice and helpful. The place was quiet and clean, and the beds were comfy.

456040,43881275,2015-08-22,36555558,Xutao,Chantel is a kind and considerate lady. Her room is so clean and the bed is comfortable. The location is so convinence for taking bus that just need walk 5 mins. I had a happy experience. 
456040,44282479,2015-08-25,31215901,Sheera,Chantel's place is so great. The location is perfect for visiting the city. The neighborhood is really beautiful and quiet. The separate unit was really nice and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to have a great stay in Seattle. 
456040,44526315,2015-08-27,32865475,Kam,We enjoyed staying at your place greatly for a couple reasons: 1/ the location is perfect as we enjoyed walking around the lake and all the shops nearby the lake; 2/ easy access to downtown and 3/ The space is clean and comfortable.  We would highly recommend this place!
456040,44899157,2015-08-30,34213535,Tasha,We had a great stay! The suite is lovely and supplied with everything we needed for our two nights.  The location is terrific!  We enjoyed walking around Greenlake and eating at the delicious local cafes.  We would stay here again and recommend to others.  Thank you!
456040,45243445,2015-09-01,20187129,Lauren,"We enjoyed our time in Seattle! Unfortunately, we weren't able to meet Chantal but the space was just as described. The shared suite was not an issue. We definitely felt like we had enough privacy. There was a lot of common area space, and even full kitchen area that could be taken advantage of. Great spot for this price point. "
456040,45948127,2015-09-07,37269044,Mark,"The listing description was accurate with clear instructions for entry to the basement suite.  A very nice, quiet neighborhood.  Chantel gave us a friendly welcome and was available if we needed anything.  (We didn't but good to know)  The suite was very clean and included a kitchen with nicely stocked amenities.  There were books and couch in the common area.  We got to talk with the other guests, who we enjoyed meeting and speaking with very much.  Overall an excellent and affordable accommodation.   We would choose to stay here again when in the Seattle area."
456040,46375006,2015-09-10,36264517,Stephanie,"Cute suite, super clean felt like home.Chantel was friendly and so helpful with any questions.great (email hidden)ose to downtown..loved walking neighborhood and absorbing true seattle vibe...would love to stay here again on a return visit to this beautiful city. "
456040,46715258,2015-09-13,37775133,Pamela,Chantel was very accommodating and friendly.  The place was clean and the neighborhood was very quiet and safe with lots of free street parking. Overall my mom and I were pleased with our experience. 
456040,47212494,2015-09-16,9125659,Will,"The apartment was very clean and the location near Greenlake was lovely.  Parking on the street was easy.   It was also easy to make arrangements with Chantel, and signs around the apartment were helpful and answered any questions we might have had."
456040,47296742,2015-09-17,2611661,Elaine,"Chantel was very communicative but I only met her husband as he was around.

The room was clean and easy to access, but it got chilly and we had to ask for more blankets as there was no heater. The blanket smelled like their dog, who paid us an unexpected visit when we arrived, which is why I thought that.

It was really loud in the room with people walking or being active overhead. It was ok as the evening went on, but it was really loud when I was lounging.

Parking was easy but follow her directions as google maps can get you lost. The lake area is really nice, but it's quicker to drive."
456040,47529740,2015-09-20,7027989,Owen,"Simple seamless experience, which was exactly what we were looking for. Thanks Chantel!"
456040,48217487,2015-09-24,33997749,Kelly,suited our needs for the night- never met our host but appreciated all of the amenities!
456040,48334642,2015-09-25,1705121,Julie,It comes exactly as advertised. Check in process was very straight forward and I was given clear instructions. The bus is also very close by and easy to take. Cute neighborhood!
456040,48546077,2015-09-27,25870083,Laura,Great location and the accommodations we're excellent!
456040,48996586,2015-09-30,38577088,Lance,"Great location, accommodations and fantastic hosts! "
456040,49517072,2015-10-04,2171288,Aryana,"Chantel's place was the perfect place to spend an evening. Clean, organized and super cozy. We didn't have the chance to connect with Chantel but check-in was super easy and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay! "
456040,51083540,2015-10-17,46251778,Wei,"Feel like at home. Very nice environment. Really enjoy the time here. This was my first time to use Airbnb. Of course, it was really nice."
456040,52016133,2015-10-25,47070029,Brian,"Excited! I was pretty enjoying the two-day stay there. Small but cozy and clean. If I went back to Seattle, I will go there again!"
456040,52569171,2015-10-31,34984842,Donna,"I arrived at night and I couldn't see any house number but I found the driveway entrance and was able to get in with the code and instructions from Chantel.  Yes, she came down and showed me the space.  One thing I didn't know from the site is that there is another bedroom that could have been rented to someone else, which would have meant sharing the bathroom, kitchen and common space with a stranger.  Happily that didn't happen.  It is in a super location with easy access to the freeway and public transportation.  All the houses around are well kept and the area has a real sense of neighborhood."
456040,53125090,2015-11-05,20534814,Christi,"It's always lovely to arrive at Chantels! I consider it my home away from home whenever I travel to Seattle. The downstairs suite is clean, cozy, and welcoming. I occasionally hear them upstairs and it is always sounds of laughter and happiness. I am always disappointed when she is booked and I have to stay somewhere else! Wonderful location wonderful hosts!"
456040,53272667,2015-11-07,16927272,Jessie,"Very convenient and excellent communication from the hostess. I arrived late at night but had no trouble figuring out how to get in or finding my room. Everything was clean and neat, and the room had lots of shelving and hangers which I really liked. I would recommend Chantal's place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
456040,54219153,2015-11-16,15940240,Audrey Jo & Paul,"Chantel was an amazing host with so many great touches to her place. The daylight basement apt is perfect for a couple with fully stocked kitchen, spacious bathroom with free soap and shampoos. The book shelves are full of great reads . You could spend a day or 2 just in her library. The house is walking distance to great pubs, coffee houses and more . We'll be back ..."
456040,54373571,2015-11-19,3562983,Mark,Great place to start. Chantel`s directions about how to reach her place were accurate and she checked in to make sure I had everything I needed. Her house is very close to transportation so getting around is no problem. I would definitely stay there again.
456040,54857598,2015-11-25,14092689,Tenaya,The room was super easy to access and had any and all amenities we could want! We appreciated having the kitchen in the suite to put food in the fridge and make coffee in the morning. It was a perfect location for our trip to explore Seattle and visit universities in the area and we would definitely stay here again. Thanks Chantel!
456040,55916017,2015-12-07,55195,Colleen,"This was my second time staying at Chantels. It is my favorite Airbnb in the Green Lake Wallingford/U District area for this price point. Two things that I really enjoy about this rental are that it has its own private entrance so I don't feel too disruptive when I come and go and it has a little living area and kitchen which is a really nice perk. I also loved the chalkboard on the door that said ""welcome back Colleen"""
456040,56164010,2015-12-09,50442385,Laura,Chantel was very welcoming and even had my name on the door! Cute and the place is quite comfortable with the usual necessities included.  Thank you chantel!
4783817,47909276,2015-09-21,39552082,Carolyn,"The room had a private entrance, was spacious, quiet, comfortable, and tastefully decorated.  Ron was very gracious and I enjoyed a few short conversations with him.  The kitchen was available, although I did not have need for it. The house was in a nice residential neighborhood and I could comfortably go jogging.  There is some parking on the street as well as a spot behind the house.  The bathroom is shared with the host.  This was not a problem at all, although it is on the other side of the kitchen and one might want a robe. All in all, a very positive experience.  I would happily stay here again."
4783817,49543162,2015-10-04,1821419,Katie,"Ron was an excellent host! Very welcoming but low key. The room and the house were both lovely and full of character. The cats were super cute, we especially loved Betty! Great Capitol Hill location on a quiet street."
4783817,57833443,2015-12-29,503063,Barry,"Thanks to Ron for being a great host! He was friendly and helpful with good recommendations for things to see in Seattle but he also respected our privacy. The house was very clean but also fun and inviting with lots of artwork. The cats, Betty and Nancy, were both really sweet.

The location was ideal because it's close to Capitol Hill but the neighborhood itself is quiet and residential. We hope to visit Seattle again and we'd love to stay at Ron's again if we can."
6921373,43308361,2015-08-18,1360058,Mitsuhiro,"We absolutely loved Jacqueline's place. The listing itself is warm, cozy, and well-appointed with wonderful furniture. The Fremont neighborhood is filled some cool spots to eat, drink, and explore. On top of all that, Jacqueline was very helpful and easy to reach throughout our stay. I'm a host myself and I definitely took notes for my own listing. We would totally come and stay again. "
6921373,44196206,2015-08-24,40441837,Mick,"We had an excellent stay at Jacqueline's place in Fremont.  The apartment was clean and bright and, because of the surrounding greenery, I felt like we were staying in a treehouse.  We were delighted with the book of walking tours we found at the apartment and walked lots of miles and climbed lots of stairs.  Fremont is a quirky, interesting and friendly neighborhood, packed with excellent restaurants and bars and friendly people.  I would recommend it, and the apartment, to anyone."
6921373,45218571,2015-08-31,22118806,David,"Jacqueline made sure to welcome me and provide many contacts during my visit to ensure everything was in order and working well. She left me two handwritten notes welcoming me as well as welcoming gifts! The neighborhood was beautiful, well located and easily accessible to all parts of Seattle."
6921373,46136635,2015-09-08,7197989,Kevin,"This was a great place to stay! The apartment is really comfortable and I truly felt like I was on vacation. Jacqueline was always quick to any question I had. She even remembered my reason for visiting Seattle months after the initial booking. I am so glad there are people like this working with Airbnb!

The location is pretty good. It is a short cab ride from downtown (about a 40 min. bus ride). The apartment is a really short walk to the center of Fremont where there is tons to do. You can also head to Ballard (20 min. bus ride, but I walked there on the Burke-Gilman Trail ) for a fantastic farmer's market, cute stores, and lots of great restaurants. I rented a bike in Ballard at followed the Burke-Gilman for miles."
6921373,46885283,2015-09-14,18203660,Daniel,"My wife and I loved our stay. Jacqueline was a great host and checked-in throughout our stay. She let us know that we could check-in early on the day of our arrival and also helped suggest some restaurants in the area. Fremont was EXACTLY our style. We loved being able to walk anywhere we wanted to go: great bars, great restaurants, even a paved path along the canal. All walkable. And it was only 12 minutes to drive to Seattle Center where my wife's conference was being held. Ballard was only 1 mile away with a handful of breweries and restaurants as well.

The apartment was comfortable and we were able to have 2 home-cooked meals easy enough during our stay. It was private but full of light and I was able to get some work done while my wife was at her conference. One thing to note is that you are a light sleeper, like me, you may have some trouble depending on who's in the apartment above. Most nights we were there it sounded like the person above was just walking non-stop back and forth until late at night. We're from Atlanta and with an early morning conference, we were in bed by 10 each night but I had trouble sleeping, even with a sound machine.

But if you're NOT a light sleeper, this place is perfect in every other way. Great location, great amenities, great host, great decor, great deal!"
6921373,47403981,2015-09-18,43223796,Atsuko,Such an inspiring place to stay! The host pays detailed attentions to make this place as adorable as they can. I felt like I was staying a mountain cottage;)  Also Jacqueline is very communicative for your needs and flexible to arrival time etc. Super close to heart of Fremont; great walk by the beautiful canal. 
6921373,50277840,2015-10-11,37503003,Justas,It was a wonderful stay. Jacqueline was very accommodating and helpful. The appartment is as described and in a nice Fremont area.
6921373,51440650,2015-10-20,12561,Diane,"Jacqueline's apartment was a wonderful place to stay! It was just as described, and such a fun spot to gather with family for Sunday lunch, and stay while visiting our kids who live in Seattle. It was clean as can be, and such a great location in the Fremont neighborhood. We felt very welcome...with a sweet note and chocolate when we arrived! We hope to stay again!"
6921373,52062236,2015-10-26,42589432,Karen,"My husband and I thought the apartment was perfect for our stay in Fremont. We loved the vibe of the space, looking through the tree  we felt like we were in a tree house. We walked to a lot of things in town, which is exactly what we wanted to do. Everything was very clean and inviting, and we didn't have to share space with anyone. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Jacqueline : )"
6921373,52634721,2015-10-31,4104799,Andrew,"Jacqueline made the experience wonderful.  Pictures are accurate and the place was great.  They had landscapers coming in to work for the week and voluntarily lowered my rate for the inconvenience even though it wasn't a problem!  Neighborhood is quiet and located perfectly between Fremont and Ballard.   I used to live in this neighborhood and love it - breweries and great food everywhere.  Jacqueline even thanked me for with a bottle of wine!

If you are choosing between locations, go with this one!"
6921373,53047913,2015-11-04,22083305,Ashley,"We really enjoyed our stay in Jacqueline's apartment. It's beautifully decorated and is really cozy to lounge around.  The kitchen  is well-stocked with everything necessary to cook a nice breakfast, and the bathroom has all the essentials, including shampoo. The parking lot is really tight but doable, and there's plenty of street parking in case it fills up. Would definitely recommend booking this place! "
6921373,53683390,2015-11-11,6076508,Mike,We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Jacqueline's apartment. Everything was exactly as described/pictured and we felt very welcome! Jacqueline even went so far as to leave a few Seattle-centric magazines that were helpful as we explored the city! Great space and great location!
6921373,54123733,2015-11-16,46026127,Teresa,Our host met us and got us oriented to the apartment.  She left us a great red wine and local chocolate.  The neighborhood is safe and in a great locarion. We felt very comfortable since we had a fully equipped kitchen as well as all the comforts of home.  The apartment was very cozy and clean. It only took a short drive to be in downtown Seattle.  I would definitely stay there again.
6921373,55505777,2015-12-01,7712064,Alison,"Jacqueline's apartment in Fremont was perfect! I was lucky to have sunshine the whole trip as the full windows made for great sunset views. The apartment is cozy, super clean, and quite spacious. Jacqueline made the check in/out process incredibly easy and was very proactive with communication. I would stay again! "
6921373,56198689,2015-12-10,12459010,Anne,Far exceeded my expectations. THANKS so very much!!!! sorry about the broken cup. please let me know if I can reimburse you.
6921373,57649276,2015-12-28,10753389,Olya,"Great location, 10-15 away from all great places in the city. Quiet neighborhood and a very cozy place itself! Lovely large windows and spacious apartment! Very easy to communicate with Jacqueline, she was very responsive and helpful!"
8168876,48624981,2015-09-27,263734,Adam,"We had a great stay at the bungalow. It was very well appointed (especially being run by a rental company). We did feel that the place felt a small lack of life given that there are not people living there full time, but some people would consider that a plus. We personally like meeting with the hosts and talking to them about the area, their favorite spots to eat, etc. 

FWIW Sea to Sky had all this information available, and the check in was very straight forward. Location was great and the areas to relax were awesome, especially the backyard and the front porch. 

Thanks!"
8034871,46234030,2015-09-08,24425695,June Yue,"Nice, clean, big, it has everything you need, including laundry, so close to everywhere, can you imagine we came back to take a nap during the day of visiting Seattle downtown. Recommend:)"
8034871,46435272,2015-09-10,11158983,Brandon,"Great space. Comfortable, clean, exactly as described. Nice quiet location with parking and all the amenities of home. A+"
8034871,46970478,2015-09-14,42427310,Aj,Overall- great experience!  Amenities were perfect and the neighborhood allowed us to experience Seattle without having to pay too much. Annalise accommodated anything we needed and was very responsive via text!  
8034871,48316534,2015-09-25,27618823,Stephen,"Great space - had everything we needed. Modern, clean, full kitchen. Annalise and her husband were nice and helpful. Easy access to downtown Seattle on Rapid Ride E. Highly recommended"
8034871,54644010,2015-11-22,1653276,Josh,"Annalise was a great host and we had a lovely stay at this cute little mother-in-law.  The apartment entrance is behind the house, and they have little hand-painted signs directing and welcoming you - it is very cute!  We also had some great beers in the fridge waiting for us, compliments of her husband the brewer!  The bedroom is nice and large with a comfy bed and an exposed beam.  The kitchen and bathroom have nice updated tiling. Overall, we were super happy with our stay here!"
8034871,57559280,2015-12-27,1523198,Pam,"The apartment was even more spacious than the pictures show. Everything we needed was provided, and the apartment was squeaky clean! The bed was very comfortable: always a plus! Being able to accommodate our dog, and having the fenced-in back yard for her, was also an extra plus. In addition, the location was excellent: lots of privacy and easy access to major roads. While this was not a problem for us at all, I will say that you can hear people walking around upstairs. I only mention this because some people might be bothered by it. We found the place to be perfect in every way, and I would highly recommend it. "
1142039,21205220,2014-10-13,20064804,Christina,"I stayed here for a little over a month while I was waiting to move into my apartment. Lee and Steve are wonderful and welcoming, and their dog Toby is such a pleasure to be around. Their home is in a nice quiet spot surrounded my green space and a wonderful garden. An easy walk or bike ride takes you to several nice cafes and restaurants.

I would recommend these hosts and their home to others!

~Christina"
1142039,23155140,2014-11-24,21059558,Lindsay,"Very warm, friendly hosts. Always willing to help me with finding locations/things to do in the area, even fed me a few times. Space was as described. Location is amazing for being in the middle of Seattle."
1142039,27260274,2015-03-01,21580549,Joey,"Lee and Steve are literally the nicest people I have ever met (I'm 100% serious)! I don't even know where to begin but I will try; they give you suggestions of what to do in Seattle based on your individual likes, they have an amazing dog named Toby who is so lovely, and their house is surrounded by extremely beautiful trees  covered in moss that I spent many hours starring at. 

Regarding the room; the room is wonderful and has an independent tempter setting so you can set it to your preference. I had more than enough space for my items and the water pressure of the shower is amazing. The location of their house is wonderful! Close to major bus routes and a peaceful area. 

Anyway in closing, Lee and Steve were the perfect host! I had many wonderful conversions with them and will miss them. 

Thank you both for an amazing time in Seattle and continue doing what you are doing! "
1142039,31047431,2015-05-01,25166597,Leonid,"Lee and Steve are the friendliest people I've come across always willing to help others. You will feel welcome in their cozy house which is close to I-5 and several bus routes but is very secluded in a rural setting. Lee and Steve are very active in the local community, care about social and environmental issues, and do  everything in their power to address them. You will also meet a very friendly dog who will give you as much attention as you allow. Please support these wonderful family by renting from them.
If nothing else, their monthly rate is among the lowest!
"
1142039,31743603,2015-05-09,29535218,Mohammed,"I felt like I am my home , they are very nice and helpful :)
sweet home and garden . 
and their dog will be one of your friend :) "
1142039,32662619,2015-05-19,3029106,Victoria,Lee and Steve have an acre or two of pastoral bliss set in a lushly wooded neighborhood in North Seattle. It is also conveniently located between two major bus lines to the UW and downtown Seattle.
1142039,34155246,2015-06-05,2799821,Greg,"Lee & Steve were amazing hosts, easy to communicate with and very welcoming in their home. The accommodations were very comfortable, and Lee & Steve had alot of knowledge to share about the area. The property is a lush and beautiful spot in the city, yet still close to transportation and some good places to eat. Would definitely recommend a stay at their place!"
1142039,38502959,2015-07-16,10045275,Susan,Lee and Steve were warm and welcoming.
1142039,38795909,2015-07-18,9251681,Keith,"Fabulous place; comfy, quiet, homey, and chickens!

Host are wonderful; very welcoming, hospitable and friendly.

Toby is an awesome doggy host; friendly,  well-mannered, and happy.

I just want to move in."
1142039,39082078,2015-07-20,31041953,Chris,"Relaxed atmosphere, an oasis in the city.  Nothing fancy, no pretense.  Great garden."
1142039,39669906,2015-07-25,37610048,David,"Lee and Steve were excellent hosts and good conversationalists. Cozy is an understatement when it comes to describing their home and the surrounding area; I never once felt unwelcome from the time I set foot on the property. Their dog Toby is wonderfully calm and affectionate and will be your friend if you allow him to be.

Everything about the home is as described and better in many ways.  Lee and Steve are very friendly people and great to talk to, but if you prefer to keep to yourself, that's always an option and is respected. I stayed with them for about five days time and I'm strongly considering going back while I wait for my apartment to become available. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay while on vacation in the area or need a place to live temporarily like myself, I strongly recommend giving this listing a chance."
1142039,43531607,2015-08-20,39477263,Alison,"Lee and Steve are the best hosts anyone could ask for.  I felt comfortable and welcome from the moment I arrived.  They are incredibly friendly and generous people, and they have a wealth of information about the area, especially about the outdoors and good places for hiking.  The house and room are cozy, simple, and pleasant.  The garden is beautiful and bountiful, and their dog is one of the most friendly, well-behaved dogs I've met.  A convenient enough location, while still being peaceful and green.  Great place to stay!"
1142039,44240837,2015-08-24,41775596,Chris,"Friendly folks, cozy room, comfy hammock and a beautiful big yard (small farm). Thornton Creek Park is a bonus; a rural island in a sea of suburbia. Lee and Steve's place was my home away from home, and Toby was my dog away from dog. High bang:buck ratio."
1142039,45191873,2015-08-31,27460426,Harmony," Lee and Steve were wonderful hosts. The room was exactly as described and the bed was super comfy. Once you round the bend of the driveway you forget you are in Seattle- the house, the garden, the birds...I felt like I was home again. They genuinely care about their guests. "
1142039,49098892,2015-10-01,35922033,Vance,"Lee and Steve are amazing hosts. They were warm and welcoming throughout my one month stay with them. The house is within a short walk to three bus lines that took me downtown or to UW very quickly. The neighborhood is safe and removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. I had a wonderful stay, and I hope to cross paths with Lee and Steve again in the future."
1142039,52833569,2015-11-02,16147254,Lester,Lee and Steve were great hosts and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was a pleasant one.  They were very resourceful and accommodating and I recommend this place for those who don't mind staying in North Seattle!
1142039,53642430,2015-11-10,20409950,Elizabeth,"Lee and Scott welcomed me warmly, oriented me to their home & garden dynamics, answered all my questions & offered local info like bus routes & possible sites to visit.  Overall they were wonderful hosts, including being flexible and helpful with several unexpected plan changes.  The accommodation was exactly as described.  The room was comfortable, especially having use of the room thermostat since it was cold & rainy most of the week."
1142039,53814622,2015-11-13,3562983,Mark,"Great place. A little slice of heaven in Seattle. Thanks for being such great hosts!

1142039,53895186,2015-11-14,25310610,Tracey,"Lee & Steve were very welcoming. When I got there, Lee was just getting home from work. She's a friendly, busy woman, bustling with life. She was kind enough to make me a cup of tea after my long drive down from the peninsula and then was off to her volunteer job. That left me alone with the dog, who is very sweet and affectionate. Just as I was turning in (quite early), Steve came home and we said a quick hello. I just stayed the one night, but the house was lovely, the bed cozy, and the hosts friendy. The neighborhood was beautiful, full of charming little houses each unique in their design. Take note: I left with plenty of time, but due to Seattle's constant, horrible traffic, the drive to the airport is actually about an hour and a half. Give yourself plenty of wiggle room. All in all, this has been a positive experience, and I would definitely call on Lee and Steve again for a place to stay when in Seattle. "
1142039,54298805,2015-11-17,45487267,Jay,"Feels like being on a farm.  Good vibes in the kitchen, big garden. chickens in the yard, happy dog,  insightful conversation."
6765354,37500815,2015-07-07,34709133,Anna,"La Dele and her husband Allan were very welcoming and great hosts. Being that this was their first experience hosting with Airbnb, they did a very splendid job. I have lived in the Seattle area my whole life, but was visiting with my boyfriend who never visited Seattle. We really enjoyed the privacy that they offered. 

When we arrived, Allan and La Dele had given us a loaf of fresh bread and blueberries which were delightful. They also provide you with free access to Netflix and YouTube for you to use during your stay. You do however need to ask La Dele and Allan for the password for the internet. They also do not have stoves or a kitchen sink so you may have to order food around the area. Otherwise they are very nice and welcoming. 

"
6765354,39647935,2015-07-25,36486705,Leon,"Alan and La Dele were great.
The place was located very close to the center of Georgetown and has lots of places close by to eat and drink. 
The place itself, worked out well. It's a simple set up, but all that we needed. If you are a light sleeper you should know there is a low noise from the store in front. Would be happy to recommend this.     "
6765354,41118196,2015-08-04,22665337,Pat,"The Host made us feel very welcome and told us a lot about the history of Georgetown and the place where we stayed.  It was lovely, comfortable and totally boho.  Orange juice in the fridge, fresh fruit, popcorn and bottled water was there for us.  She also told us all the new and interesting places locally for food, wine and giant cowboy boots.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely rebook again.  The adjoining store had a wonderful selection of wine, craft beer and cider.  Couldn't ask for nicer hosts.  Thanks for a great time!"
6765354,41515795,2015-08-07,35165006,Erica,"This was such a cute, lovely little home. The hosts were both very welcoming and showed amazing hospitality. They also own the small store in front which was so convenient when we wanted to buy a few things. "
6765354,41964289,2015-08-10,27381721,Mae,"La Dele and Allan (and little Ernesto!) were very friendly. Their home was good for a weekend trip; the bus stop on the same block was a definite plus! The bus went right downtown Seattle, and we felt safe on urban transportation. There are restaurants within walking distance, and the weekend nightlife in Georgetown was alive and funky. 

The house has a private entrance in the back, and has a yard with an extra lock on the gate. Street parking was free and plentiful. 

The house is old! Built in 1904! It comes with all of the charm that old houses have: creaks, smells, and classic fixtures. We also have an older house and were expecting its charms. The service area had orange juice, popcorn, and sparkling water. Take advantage of local fare, as the space does not have a sink or stovetop. Though our hosts provided dishes and cutlery- very thoughtful!

We slept well. Other reviewers mentioned the industrial noises. There were planes overhead, cars on the road, and train whistles about a mile away, but we slept like rocks all through the night. "
6765354,42447516,2015-08-13,34119041,Allison,"We had a great experience staying here. It was convenient to be able to walk into the grocery store in the front to ask questions or get recommendations about where to eat inthe neighborhood. The unit was clean, homey, and comfortable. Our hosts were especially accomodating to our travel schedules, which we greatly appreciated."
6765354,43398842,2015-08-19,10160951,Steve,"La Dele and Allan were wonderful hosts! We had limited interaction; mostly at check-in & check out, but it was all positive. The apartment was very nice and in a really cool neighborhood."
6765354,44124132,2015-08-24,36173043,Tony,"Le Dele met us at the grocery store and gave us a tour with Ernesto (the pug)! We appreciate the small touches of coffee, sparkling water, teas, and snacks that they had provided. Alan popped in later and introduced himself. They gave us suggestions and understood we were both a bit tired. We stayed for more than a few days so we accumulated dishes and trash. Alan said he will take care of it. Not only did he take care of it, he also changed our towels! We felt completely floored by their kindness. As for noises, we are from NYC so we were used to it. We recommend their home! It is about 30 mins from downtown Seattle on the bus or 15 minutes if you drive."
6765354,44792937,2015-08-29,5743713,Katie,"La Dele and Allan were lovely hosts- friendly, helpful, and available when we needed them. The apartment was just as advertised and we enjoyed our time there immensely. "
6765354,46210807,2015-09-08,42609228,Randall,"La Dele and Alan are both wonderful people. We were married and wanted a place to get away (since we had guests at our apartment). Apart from being easy to talk to and work with, my bride and I were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a card. They're kind without expecting anything and we will be letting all our friends coming to Seattle know this is a great place. 
"
6765354,54205262,2015-11-16,14296950,Crystal,"We had a wonderful experience staying at La Dele and Alan's place it was perfect for the two of us. We met with La Dele and she was so friendly & easy to talk to, we chatted about the event we were in town for and she helped us out getting to know the area. Both her and Alan were so accommodating with anything we needed. We couldn't have found a better host or place to stay. We will definately stay with them again!"
6765354,56501420,2015-12-14,33122378,Joe,"La Dele and Allen's cute store was perfect. Fantastic location in hip and historic Georgetown. We walked everywhere. No need to drive once you've made it to their place! The space was clean, comfortable and quiet. We would definitely recommend and/or go back again. "
9329068,56455068,2015-12-13,50889597,Brandon,"Perfect home base for a weekend exploring the city! Jennifer was super attentive and always available. The apt was clean, quiet and had all the essentials, including a great roof-top to hangout and admire the city. No bells and whistles, but who needs 'em when you have this kind of location? The neighborhood is vibrant, alive with nightlife, shopping, and great coffee (check out Starbucks Reserve!!). All the classic tourist spots are easily walkable: Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and the Aquarium to name a few. "
9329068,56834661,2015-12-18,9429487,Harry,"Jennifer was a total pro. She had all her bases covered and left us wanting and needing nothing.  Her place is super cozy and matched her description and pictures to the T.  Highly recommend staying at her place, I know I will again."
9329068,57402311,2015-12-25,42234969,Bryan,"Beautiful apartment in a Great location. I walked everywhere! Parking is a bit of an issue. But as in every city, just mind your meter. I would definitely stay here again."
9329068,57710833,2015-12-28,28725442,MiShell,"Thank you Jennifer! Everything about this location was perfect for our weekend ""staycation"". The Paramount Theater is right around the corner. The building is secure and modern. The studio is clean, comfortable and spacious. The rooftop deck (even in the wet cold Seattle weather) was a great spot for views of the city. And the rooftop dog walk really helped with late night/early morning doggie visits. Parking wasn't even difficult, due to the paid parking lot next door. Such a bonus for the downtown location.  We really hope to stay here again soon. "
8691263,51519912,2015-10-20,28541879,Ravi,"The apartment was very nice and was accurately depicted by the pictures, however, there were a few hiccups. Some amenities claimed to be offered were not (some of which were deciding factors to book with Laura). This def put a damper on our mood, however, Laura was apologetic and did refund us a portion of our stay. The listing has since been updated so hopefully there are no problems for future guests. "
8691263,51671696,2015-10-22,22579982,Austin,We had a great time in Seattle. The apartment has the perfect location for getting to downtown easily. It was also very clean with beautiful views of the city. Our favorite part was the wrap around roof top patio. 
8691263,51878758,2015-10-24,42446599,Christine,"Before I go into the details, I just want to say this is the BEST apartment I have ever stayed in on Airbnb, and the BEST deal ever.
With a space needle view and a gorgeous city view from the 8ft tall window, coupled with a modem and tasteful decoration, this apartment is just stunning The roof top terrace is breathtaking, with a stunning view of the water. Above all, Laura does a great job communicating with me and  make sure that I feel at home. She even provided me with a baby crib after knowing we are traveling with a five month old. 
Staying at absolutely the heart of downtown Seattle, having a view of the Space needle and the water, enjoying the luxury amenities in the building, easily communicating with a thoughtful host, and in the end paying less than most the listings in the same area, I really don't have much to say other than: Laura, I will sure be back! :)"
8691263,52279244,2015-10-27,29901217,Omer,"From the moment I stepped into the building, I knew my stay was going to be nice.  The location,  apartment  setting,  view from the unit and rooftop was beyond magnificent.  I would stay her again if I come back to Seattle."
8691263,52467810,2015-10-29,47484112,Shane,A very nice and clean place. Great view and location. Laura was very helpful.
8691263,52652761,2015-10-31,47431188,Kate,Great location. Pictures were accurate. Very comfortable and clean. I will be recommending this location to everyone I know!
8691263,52902123,2015-11-02,46974481,Monica,"Gorgeous apartment with a perfect view. The location was close to any and all types of food we could dream of, and the exchange to check in and out was so simple! I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
8691263,53102059,2015-11-04,32985881,Liz,Excellent apartment! Space was clean with an amazing view. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Laura is easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Overall very positive experience.  
8691263,53204744,2015-11-06,30740901,Kathleen,"It was our first time visiting Downtown Seattle, and we had one of the best experiences by far, and it was all in part of the lovely home that Laura provided for us. It was my first time using Airbnb, so I did not know what to expect. There were a little bumps along the way (my part) but Laura was so patient and understanding! She was also very kind and lenient with a late check out! On to the place itself. It is gorgeous! So contemporary and chic. The photos do not do it justice. The amenities are also are great bonus that anyone who rents her place out NEEDS to take advantage of. The rooftop view is all you need, skip the space needle! We had a delightful time in Seattle, thank you Laura!"
8691263,53384425,2015-11-08,8029053,Jeremy,"This place is so awesome. Super clean, simple and classy. Awesome location. Rooftop lounge = incredible. Host was very accommodating and flexible. Would love to come back!"
8691263,53826548,2015-11-13,32667609,Steve,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I don't think I could have had a better experience anywhere else. The apartment is very nice, has a great view of the Space Needle and Seattle skyline, and the rooftop terrace and amenities are amazing. 

Laura was a great host. She was very helpful and was readily available to answer any calls or texts. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to be in the downtown Seattle area, and close to Pike Place. "
8691263,54426288,2015-11-19,49306463,David,"Nice place, very clean, will definitely stay here again. Would hang out on the rooftop patio if we had more time. Easily accessible to Pike Place and other Seattle favorites. Communication was very prompt and easy."
8691263,54615111,2015-11-22,21560984,Heath,"Great communication, responded quickly to questions. "
8691263,54906134,2015-11-25,31429969,Jocelyn,"This was my first Airbnb and it will be tough to beat. Location was perfect. The building amenities were awesome and fit our lifestyle wonderfully. If you plan to stay I highly recommend planning an afternoon or evening utilizing the rooftop deck. While the weather was not great for us while we stayed, I would literally come back just to experience that rooftop space. I brought my son for a college tour and am planning to come back next spring or summer with my husband. Laura is an excellent host and has set up a great place in the heart of Seattle. "
8691263,55420792,2015-12-01,47500135,Linda,"Laura was amazing!  We arrived on Thanksgiving day and she took time out of her holiday to make sure the apartment was clean and ready EARLY.  This was truly going above and beyond!  The apartment is in a perfect location, just two easy blocks from Pike Place and walking distance to all the major downtown hotspots (including Space Needle, Pioneer Square, and sports facilities).  The apartment looks exactly like the photos - beautiful!  I HIGHLY recommend Laura's place for your next trip to Seattle.  It will certainly be ours."
8691263,55592776,2015-12-02,7074942,Cyn,"Gorgeous modern high rise apartment. Laura was very responsive and her listing was well-appointed with toiletries, coffee, and stylish furniture. She even made a pack n play available for our toddler daughter. I highly recommend this listing and this host."
8691263,56273791,2015-12-11,47601470,Stephanie,"This was a fabulous first Airbnb experience for me. The apartment is gorgeous, modern, and clean, with a great view of the city and space needle, and walking distance to Pike Place and nearby Belltown. I even walked to my office in Pioneer Square which was just a nice 20min walk away. Laura was so on top of things with sending instructions ahead of time. The lockbox situation was new to me so I had a little bit of trouble getting the keys out but Laura responded promptly and courteously to my texts at 11pm and I was able to get the keys out just fine in the end. I'm very happy with my experience! :) I'd love to stay here again if I come back to Seattle."
8691263,56389523,2015-12-13,48206814,Lloyd,We had a fabulous time - the apartment was perfect and the roof top was amazing.  We are looking forward to staying again soon.
8691263,56940024,2015-12-20,19259958,Peter,"Amazing high rise apartment with great views and amenities. The apartment's location provides easy access to nightlife and dining in Pike Place, Belltown, and Capital Hill. I would highly recommend this apartment and host. Laura made it easy to check in and check out along with proving advice about local attractions."
8691263,58161398,2016-01-01,312655,Joshua,"If you want to explore downtown Seattle this location and apartment are awesome! Seriously. Great building/facilities. Laura was a very good host: clearly communicated everything and even let us drop our bags off early so we could go exploring. Rooms were spotless with awesome views.

The roof is amazing. You're welcome up there- and do go check it at sunrise/sunset. One tiny caveat: during a few events their is a resident guest list to get in to the roof. Like during NYE :( Other than that: super awesome!"
6249458,31560290,2015-05-06,32460326,Quan,"Bonnie and Brian's apartment was great and they were really friendly and accommodating. The location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill and walk-able to so many great restaurants, bars. The backyard was cute and we were able to grill up some food we purchased from Pike’s Place Market and enjoy the Seattle weather.  My family  had a comfortable stay. There were lots of towels and the kitchen was well stocked.  We would stay here again in the future.
"
6249458,33296617,2015-05-26,28823034,Yvonne,We were in town from Alaska to deliver twins. Had a great experience at the place. They even bought our toddler a baby to play with to get used to siblings. Very convenient and comfortable. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Thanks for everything.
6249458,34658597,2015-06-10,26155624,Kelvin,"My family and I have a great and relaxed stay at Bonnie & Brain's place for a week! They are super nice to help out with everything, including sending me a list of to-dos in the Seattle area. The house located in a very convenient neighborhood - Capitol Hill, just a block away from Broadway Ave! Highly recommend!"
6249458,35385886,2015-06-18,32366516,Loretta,"Even though we arrived late in the evening (after 11), our host Bonnie greeted us with a big smile when we pulled up.  The apartment was really nice and included everything we needed. We are a family of 5, and Bonnie had graciously made up an air mattress too. The first morning we had a problem with the coffee maker, and by the time we returned ""home"" that evening, there was a brand new one! The place is conveniently located  to many restaurants and shops, all within walking distance. When we did have to take the car, the dedicated parking spot was a definite plus. We did not use the yard, so I cannot comment on that, but overall, we had a very comfortable stay. I highly recommend it!
If you are looking for a home away from home, I   "
6249458,36873086,2015-07-02,31330141,Anna,"We had a great stay! Enjoyed the convenient location, driveway parking, and comfortable beds. We also happened to visit during an unusually hot week and the apt stayed very cool, which was a relief!"
6249458,37486479,2015-07-07,35149203,Jesus,"My friend and I had an awesome stay in Capitol Hill.  The location was perfect, everything you needed within a few minutes walk, and having a parking spot was a bonus. 
Bonnie and Brian also had some time to socialize with us, which helped us feel more welcome.  Would definitely stay here again. "
6249458,37850793,2015-07-11,32528655,Julie,"The Apartment was just as described and in the location we wanted.  Parking was a must while we explored downtown. Air Conditioning  might not usually be an issue, but it worked out great for our visit.  We would stay there again while exploring Seattle."
6249458,38123291,2015-07-13,22665300,Tiffany,"Having been to Seattle several times, my family of four decided to branch outside of the central Seattle area and stay in the trendy Capitol Hill. We absolutely loved our stay! As far as the neighborhood, there are plenty of great restaurants, bars, and shops that line Broadway E which is just a block away from the house.

The house itself was exactly as advertised, it is a daytime basement with an entrance located towards the back of a darling Craftsman-style home. The apartment has been completely renovated and has a beautifully-done kitchen and is decorated with modern furniture and finishes. The hosts go above and beyond, providing soap, shampoo/conditioner, coffee, laundry detergent, etc. Bonnie did an excellent job in recommending restaurants in the area and was happy to give us advice when asked. The fact that there is a parking spot included was a real bonus as well, as parking in the area is tough and if you were staying at a hotel downtown a spot can cost over $25/day.

Do yourself a favor and stay here! A very comfortable, clean, conveniently-located place!

6249458,38722383,2015-07-18,34472766,Nikhil,This apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It's located in a great area of the city with lots of bars and restaurants. 
6249458,39325255,2015-07-22,10305266,Gerard,"Wonderful! Bonnie was a friendly host, and her place was exactly as described.  The location was conveniently located with lots of shops and restaurants all within a block or two, and the main downtown core just a few minutes away by car."
6249458,39924415,2015-07-27,14880917,Lyndsey,"Bonnie was a great host! From day one her communication exceeded my expectations. We loved staying at her place and felt very welcomed. The house had every accommodation needed to ensure a very pleasant stay. The location would be hard to beat! We loved being walking distance from many neat restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, and bars. I fell in love with the area and the nice quiet neighborhood! I highly recommend staying here for a group of five or less. We had five and it was plenty comfortable. Thanks, Bonnie! "
6249458,42517878,2015-08-14,32443123,Guillaume,"I had an amazing stay. The apartment is great, very clean, comfy and well equipped (two bedroom two bathroom, great kitchen !!). The backyard is a great plus. The location is simply perfect. The parking spot is a blessing.
Besides I felt very welcome. Bonnie is definitely a great host ! 
Thank you guys !"
6249458,46865275,2015-09-14,14663508,Len,"Bonnie Donovan was a generous and wonderful host for our month-long stay at the apartment in her home on Capitol Hill.  We were greeted warmly as we arrived from the airport and shown her spacious 2BR, 2B apartment that was well stocked with soft towels, linens and various bath and kitchen items, including bottled water to take on our daily excursions; Keurig coffee pods and soap tablets for both the clothes and dishwasher.
Her response to our requests was immediate, including the installation of a curved shower rod for the tub.
Pros:  The newly created apartment had lots of room and privacy for the two of us; having two full baths was much appreciated; the bed was very comfortable; the kitchen was well set up for our breakfasts and a few dinners with excellent appliances; we had use of the gas grill; the supply of good towels was unlimited; there are plenty of lights; the heating system kept us comfortable with different settings possible in each room; we were only occasionally aware of our host living upstairs; the neighborhood is quiet and convenient to many local restaurants as well as to city bus lines.
Cons: basement apartment with limited natural light and limited privacy on one side; kitchen needs small dishes and cups.
This was a great place for our month in Seattle and we recommend it highly."
8955477,52769700,2015-11-01,47145442,Donald,"Location is great; right near the bustle of Capitol Hill but removed enough to be more quiet. Space is well maintained and comfortable for up to 3-4 people to stay. Tea tray and host communication made us feel very welcome. Guest parking pass was invaluable to making our trip to Seattle convenient. Thanks again for opening your home to us, we would definitely recommend this host for travelers seeking accommodation in a trendy part of town."
8955477,52904636,2015-11-02,25108663,Lonnie,"Miranda and Adam's home was great! I'm very familiar with Seattle and Capitol Hill, and I can say that their location is great for getting to anywhere worth being (right next to Cal Anderson Park too). We didn't get to meet either of them, but they did everything to make our stay as welcoming and seamless as possible. There were clean towels and linen, a parking pass for the neighborhood, and even an extra air mattress for the living room. They even left us fancy chocolate :D

We would highly recommend their home, especially at such a good price. "
6250399,44034411,2015-08-23,26536933,Alix,"The apartment itself was totally fine - about what we expected, based on the photos and description. The space was a great size for 2 people and it was nice to have the kitchenette as an option while visiting Seattle. Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern. Again, the apartment itself was great and exactly what we were looking for, but my fiance and I agreed the alley view was something that needed to be mentioned."
392779,1434935,2012-06-07,2512670,Frank,"Great downstairs in-law like option with plenty of room. The hosts were very welcoming and provided suggestions on local places to eat since we arrived late in the day. We drove by car from here to downtown Seattle, which was a very short jaunt. There's also a transit station nearby if you don't have a car or don't want to pay for downtown parking. Overall, would recommend and stay again."
392779,1467426,2012-06-12,2343656,Joni,Our stay was very nice the apartment was very clean and had everything you needed for cooking.
392779,1505935,2012-06-18,2354796,Ewa,"We loved our vacation in Seattle, to a large extent thanks to our awesome, spacious apartment we were renting from Jyoti and her husband.
The place was perfect in all ways: sparkling clean, brand new renovation, all the conveniences we needed (full kitchen AND washer/dryer), and very roomy for a family of three. Wireless was plenty strong for all our devices. The beds are so comfortable my daughter requested ""hers"" for her birthday next week. Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming, and their farewell gift bag for our last night totally hit the spot (among other niceties, a bottle of yummy Cab).
But even more importantly, we really enjoyed the wonderful location. There are INCREDIBLE views within 1-2 blocks from the house, in both directions - Seatlle/downtown and Mt. Rainier. On a clear day, just grab your coffee mug and go sit on the bench down the street, contemplating the Cascades and the Seattle skyline.  The place is just a few blocks away from the the Beacon Hill light rail station and the grocery store, which saved us some money, since we were able to make breakfast and even cooked dinner once (Jyoti let us use spinach from her garden D).  
If we come back to Seattle, we will be sure to book with Jyoti again. This was our first reservation via airbnb.com and we are totally hooked now. I honestly don't think we will ever do another hotel."
392779,1570838,2012-06-26,2649744,Meg,"The apartment was clean and comfortable with everything we needed for a fun weekend stay in Seattle.  Jyoti was friendly and offered great advice and even a bottle of wine for our stay.  If I need a place in Seattle again anytime soon, I will absolutely stay here again.  "
392779,1682492,2012-07-11,2216437,Alexandra,"Our stay in Seattle was incredible! We just loved everything, staying at Jyoti' s house..very confortable, clean, beautiful, had everything we needed. It is the same be at home. Its a calm place. Jyoti  is a goodl host, we are glad to recommend her place. She receives us with a wine bottle... Tha house is brand new.. . We could not be better.  We will be in contact with her.. "
392779,1746817,2012-07-19,1454346,Joe,"According to Jyoti, ""Break-ins are a common occurrence across Seattle these days and we expect our guests to follow the rules. I emailed you about it too the night before you left.""

I feel so terrible.  I had no idea from the listing ""Plush Modern Hilltop Retreat"" that this basement apartment was actually in a dangerous neighborhood and that I may have been putting my family in danger by staying there.

There might have been mold in the dark apartment which caused me to experience some serious asthmatic wheezing. We needed to air out the musty smell from the apartment.

Tragically . . . we were asleep and didn't get the message Jyoti sent us @ 11:13pm the night before we left @ 5:30am. The information ""be sure to lock all windows and doors when you leave including the front door,""  contained in the final sentence of a 6 paragraph e-mail wasn't read by me until it was too late. 

Of course it was very, very irresponsible of us not to read the rules and in the 15 communications FROM Jyoti (2 in person) we should have asked her about the danger and crime in Seattle generally and in her neighborhood specifically and we should have wondered (having lived in actual dangerous neighborhoods in London and NYC and Brooklyn and Washington DC and LA for many many years) why there aren't bars or alarms on all the windows and doors of the apartment.  

If only we had . . . if only, as Jyoti wrote, we hadn't  ""dropped the ball on observance of house rules,"" and created a ""major trust and security breach.""

I'm very sorry about all that indeed and boy have we learned our lesson about the new definition of the term ""security breach.""

I was originally going to write, ""Recently remodeled, nice apartment, close to transportation . . . perfect for our lovely trip to Seattle.  The apartment had everything we could want and more.  Jyoti was lovely and friendly and very helpful."" But I guess all that is meaningless now that we've violated the house rules.  

Lesson Learned: Make sure you read the house rules!!"
392779,1882553,2012-08-04,2531253,Mark,"Jyoti an Tushar were excellent hosts and I would recommend their apartment to anyone traveling to Seattle. I stayed with my wife and parents and there was plenty of room for all four of us to relax after a long day of sightseeing. The apartment is close to the N Beaon Hill light rail station which offers easy access to downtown Seattle in about ten minutes. It is also easily accessible from the main highway offering easy access from the airport and to visit Mt Rainier and the Olympic Peninsula. The apartment was bright, clean and modern and we all extremely enjoyed our stay. If visiting Seattle in the future I would have no hesitation in staying with Jyoti and Tushar again."
392779,1922709,2012-08-08,2463418,Molly,"I visited Seattle from North Carolina for a friend's wedding weekend and this apartment was perfect for our needs and our budget! We did rent a car and the house was within very easy driving of anywhere we wanted to go in the city.

Jyoti and her husband were out of town that weekend so we were unable to meet them in person. However, any questions we did have were answered extremely quickly and we definitely felt well taken care of."
392779,1959383,2012-08-12,891893,Gloria,"My mother and I had a great time staying here.  So great to have two private rooms.  It was very clean and cozy, and Jyoti had thoughtfully left some basic provisions in the kitchen to start us off.  The surrounding residential neighborhood is peaceful and quiet.  We got around by bus and taxi.  Bus stops (#39 and #60) are very close, making it easy to get into the downtown areas.  It was easy to communicate with Jyoti, and I would highly recommend this place!"
392779,2037783,2012-08-20,174048,Burt,"Nice very quiet neighborhood (completely safe part of Seattle, no need to worry) and has great freeway access (for those who want to venture onto 15) with easy parking. The furnishings are very modern and comfortable with a nice washer/dyer in the unit. No problems checking in or communicating with the hosts at all."
392779,2081207,2012-08-24,2854573,Steven,"This was our first AirBNB experience and very nice.  The unit was clean and nicely stocked.  

Being unfamiliar with Seattle, we parked the car and used the light rail, which was a pleasant 10-minute walk away.  I can see this being more of an issue during the west coast's notorious rainy season, but at the time we were there, the weather was cool and pleasant.

5-star rating all around.  Thank you."
392779,2137060,2012-08-29,3236753,Cj,"Our trip was an unplanned visit with family. Jyoti has an immaculate space and windows that let in full light - sometimes quite necessary in Seattle! The walks to Mass, the light rail, grocery and park Let us visit in a homey environment. Essential for the needs of our trip.The entire experience was excellent. When I return to Seattle this would be my first choice for accomdations."
392779,2229574,2012-09-08,2554605,Charmaine,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. We like to have space and the freedom to move arround. Getting there and into town was great fun on the new light train. The Red Apple, walking distance, was a great place to shop for food and beverages.

A definate 10 out of 10

Andre and Charmaine, South Africa."
392779,2313418,2012-09-17,1389821,Franka,"We stayed with our small son for a week and enjoyed it! The apartment is great, nicely furnished, and having a washer and dryer is a plus. The location is very close to Jefferson Park & a lookout towards Downtown Seattle (walking distance). The neighborhood does not feel unsafe at all- we liked being there.
Franka, Dexter and Eric"
392779,2366686,2012-09-21,1278751,Bill,"Awesome.  We needed to find a place in a hurry after our other accommodations fell through, and Jyoti came through for us.  It's a great place, super comfortable, and as clean as could be.  This is the first place I've stayed on AirBNB that I'd seek out again when I was in the area."
392779,2406311,2012-09-25,216385,Els,"We were very happy with our choice for Jyoti's appartment! It's easy to park the car and you're in Seattle in about a 10min drive. Even though parking isn't great in the city, we thought it worked out well.

We stayed in the house with 4 people (2 couples) and really liked it. The apartment looks very new on the inside and has everything you'd want (fridge, dishwasher, microwave, everything for cooking, TV, comfy beds, clean towels). 

Communication went smooth with Jyoti and check-in was easy. We'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxed stay in Seattle!"
392779,2467848,2012-10-01,3355034,Stella,"My husband and I stayed in this LOVELY home while I visited Seattle for my belated honeymoon and brother's wedding. It was so homey and inviting, and I don't think we could have picked a better place for ourselves. The place is very clean, nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would find at any hotel (shampoo/conditioner, towels, hairdryer, etc.). Plus, we were welcomed with a bottle of red wine and sparkling water! From our communications and brief meeting with Tushar I could tell that this couple has really put their hearts into this home and into sharing their love of traveling with others. I honestly have no complaints whatsoever and plan on staying there for my next trip to Seattle! HIGHLY recommend."
392779,2514386,2012-10-05,3583049,Joyce,"The place was clean, and so convenient for traveling in and around the city.  Would certainly stay here again. "
392779,2723998,2012-10-26,413396,Paula,"This is a really exceptional place in every way, and was the perfect temporary home during a stressful time as I began my new job in Seattle, before finding a place to live. They really did think of every last detail (the bottle of wine was especially appreciated!  Oh, and the coffee. And the washer and dryer. And all the hangers in the closets. And the plush bed. And the DVDs ... I could go on and on). Jyoti was extremely helpful and welcoming, and just perfect to work with during this chaotic time. Parking on the street was easy, and the commute to both downtown Seattle and Bellevue on the Eastside was a breeze. Everything is brand-new and sparkling clean. All in all, exceptionally well thought-out, comfortable, welcoming and very nearly just like home.  I recommend this VERY HIGHLY!!"
392779,2839221,2012-11-08,2322217,Abby,"My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay.  Everything was clean and new, and we were very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again."
392779,3091181,2012-12-15,2927830,Shwu Shenn,"It was a good 3 weeks stay for me. Jyoti and Tushar got the place set up for rental so you wont feel like you are living in someone's pad. Everything is clean and working well. You basically have your own space. period. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. I have a car so it works out even better but they have convenient public transport in the vicinity. I will say go for it, guys! Point to note: I wont consider this too much of a demerit but you can hear movement from the second floor, and the trains honking in the morning."
392779,3643048,2013-02-26,939912,Joslin,"My mother and I stayed in Jyoti's place for what was to be three nights, and we ended up extending for one more night we liked the place so much. Jyoti was welcoming, and the place was spotless-so clean! I will definitely be recommending her place to my future friends and family who will visit me in Seattle. Thanks Jyoti!"
392779,3908299,2013-03-26,5108091,Will,"I really can't speak highly enough of the space Jyoti and her husband have created here. It is clean, beautifully decorated, and very welcoming. The location is a short walk to the Light Rail which connects you to most of Seattle, and an even shorter walk to some bus stops. There are a couple of nice bars an easy walk away, maybe 5-10 minute depending on how you walk. 

Everything in the apartment is provided for and has been thought out in great detail. There are two bedrooms, which we didn't end up needing, but it made me think of how much space the place really has. We cooked in the kitchen nearly every day and it was a great experience. There are plenty of pots and pans, and anything else you might need. 

The owners are friendly, nice people, but were in no way intrusive or  hovering. We really had the best time staying here and highly recommend it. For those unfamiliar with the area, we found that using the Light Link was the best way of getting around from here. We were able to take it directly from the airport, and it took us into downtown with a short trip any day we were going out. Thank you again for creating such an enjoyable experience!"
392779,3962736,2013-03-31,278488,Trillium,"We loved our stay at Jyoti's place. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is a great home base to explore the Seattle area. It's a quick light rail ride to downtown, but it's in a really great residential area with a nice retail area (grocery, coffee, bakery etc). We loved how diverse the neighborhood was. The parks close by are great for their views of the Olympic range, downtown skyline, and harbor. If you have a little one, there are nearby nicely updated parks and we spotted a water feature underway. 

The space itself is perfect for up to 4 people, spotlessly clean and furnished with all you need for a quiet evening in. We never used the entertainment options, but they're there, and the wifi was great. I was worried about noise from I5, but the neighborhood is nice and quiet at night. There are awesome eateries a short drive away (we love Vietnamese and Ethiopian food, so we didn't eat in the neighborhood during our short stay, but there are closer, walkable options too)."
392779,4084889,2013-04-08,41458,Erin,"Jyoti's hilltop retreat was a perfect location for our weekend.  It's located in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood close enough to downtown that you can get easily head out on the town for a night, but far enough away that you escape the hustle and bustle.  The apartment is modern and clean, and it's decorated simply and tastefully with cool artwork.  We also appreciated the washer and dryer, since we were coming off of a week-long business trip and needed some fresh clothes.  One of our guests cooked one night, and she found everything she needed to make a nice meal for a quiet night.  Finally, we truly appreciated Jyoti's flexibility - we arrived in Seattle fairly late, but Jyoti made no fuss of it and met us with the keys and a warm smile.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone - friends, couples, and families!"
392779,4189801,2013-04-16,3395405,Nicole,"We had everything we needed in Jyoti's place. It was very clean, had a lot of natural sunlight, the rooms were spacious and well furnished (beds are really comfortable!), and it is in a peaceful neighborhood. Jyoti left us a lot of magazines and guides to help us discover Seattle. We will definitely be back! (:"
392779,4253397,2013-04-22,5103454,Mary,"Comfortable, quiet, spacious, affordable and spotlessly clean.  So easy to access downtown or to get to and from the city with a car (we did both). We were in Seattle for four crazy days of business and couldn't have asked for a better place to work as we needed to ""spread out"" or a better place to sleep and ""pass out"" each night. Would recommend this apartment to anyone (actually I already have) and would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Enjoy!"
392779,4328474,2013-04-28,5912107,Pat,"Loved Jyoti's place! It was perfect. Only a 12 minute drive to downtown Seattle but was still in a nice, beautiful, & quiet neighborhood! Everything about it was good...two large bedrooms w/queen beds, modern furniture, full kitchen, full bathroom, location, quality, price, etc. "
392779,4682787,2013-05-20,3378520,Nickole,"Our family of four (including 2 children) enjoyed our stay at this location.  The place was comfortable and fully stocked with the items we needed for the kitchen.  There were two good sized closets and a washer and dryer that worked wonderfully well. There was no parking available at the house but on-street parking was available---this was fine and there were no issues with this.   It was a little hard having children and trying to keep them more quiet so they didn't disturb Jyoti and her husband who live upstairs, although Jyoti never hinted that they were a disturbance.  Overall, the experience was great.  "
392779,4825290,2013-05-28,5385179,David,The reservation was canceled 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
392779,5022018,2013-06-08,6138309,Rich,It was a fantastic place.  All of the amenities you need at a great price and it makes you feel like home.  The hosts were very accommodating and resourceful to help you make your trip enjoyable.  It was close to the Light-Rail to travel to downtown area and the stadiums to avoid those costly parking fees.  We enjoyed all of the sights and sounds of Seattle and we will definitely come back again for more adventures.  
392779,5373999,2013-06-26,4311041,Richard,"Jyoti's place was very clean, and spacious! Well-stocked up too. Closed to downtown, and other attractions! We enjoyed our stay very much. Strongly recommended! "
392779,5546805,2013-07-05,2902154,Samantha,"We had a really nice stay with Jyoti and Tushar. They were awesome hosts, going above and beyond and taking the time with us - which is even more amazing considering they had their hands full with their first newborn! We felt very autonomous in the lower contained flat and never heard a peep from upstairs.
The accommodations were spotless, neat and well stocked. The abundance of maps and tourist guides were especially useful. The location, while suburban, was very close to the Link light rail which was cheap and easy and gets you downtown in no time at all. There is also a lovely big grocery store (Big Apple) near the station which came in really handy. We would definitely stay again if we were in Seattle. Thanks so much for having us!"
392779,5796204,2013-07-16,7250991,Carl,"This was our first experience with a bed and breakfast (B&B).  The thought of staying in house with the owners was a bit strange. We were hesitant at first, but wanted to have the experience.  We loved it!  The owners lived upstairs and did not bother once.  They were extremely attentive to all of our needs from coffee filters to an extra set of keys.  The place was very nice and it had everything we could need.  It was like home away from home.  The neighborhood was quiet and easy to navigate to everywhere.  We were literally less than 10-15 minutes away from downtown via car or train. The host was very sweet, attentive and accommodating.  They definitely heighten the expectation for a B&B in the future."
392779,5893240,2013-07-21,7226027,Stefan,I found this place for my family who was coming to visit me in Seattle. I live in the same neighborhood and found Jyoti's house to be a great place to stay. The downstairs space is comfortable and private. The street they are on is quiet. The approach for planes to the airport passes right overhead and can get loud. This is not an issue if you close the windows at night.  
392779,6199062,2013-08-03,7307995,Susan,"The apartment was SPOTLESS. Jyoti was very gracious with her welcome, was available when we needed her, and respected our privacy.  The apartment was comfortable and all appliances worked well.  This is a quiet, residential neighborhood, with basically nothing happening nearby.  However, the light rail station is only about 1/2 mile away, and downtown is less than 10 minutes away by car.  So if you're looking for action just outside your doorstep, you may not be interested, but if you're looking for a peaceful getaway, I heartily recommend Jyoti's place."
392779,6313529,2013-08-07,7810487,Robert,"The place was perfect for us.  The apartment was clean, well-stocked, and just the right size for the 3 of us.  We had easy access to light rail for quick trips to a baseball game and a Pike Market excursion.  Since we spent most of our time with friends in Capital Hill, the apartment made for easy access by car.  We love Seattle and we now have a great spot to stay in the future.  We'll definitely return to  2/1 Plush Modern Hilltop Retreat.  "
392779,6396070,2013-08-11,32046,Ely,"This unit is located in a quite area of Beacon Hill in Seattle. Jyoti and her husband have converted the lower level of their home for rental space. The unit is very clean and well organized, and our host, Jyoti, was helpful and extremely gracious. "
392779,6489268,2013-08-14,5391387,Eric,"My family and I stayed for 3 nights at Jyoti's place. The space is exactly as is described in the profile. Very clean and welcoming and Jyoti is a great host. It's about a 10 minute walk to the train which will take you to all that downtown Seattle has to offer. There are even some decent local options for dining if you don't feel like trekking back into the city one night. We would stay again if given the opportunity.
"
392779,6757098,2013-08-24,316046,Angela,"The Plush Modern Hilltop Retreat is just as pictured and described by your host, Jyoti.  If you read the description, you will see that she has though out everything to make this a comfortable, chic, home away from home, and it is.  The space is will designed and appointed.  The beds are comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need to prepare simple meals (although we only fixed breakfast because there are so many great restaurants in Seattle).  

Jyoti also leaves you with many recommendations for restaurants and services in the area.  All are easily accessible and we enjoyed the ones we tried.  

If you go to Seattle, this is a perfect place to stay.  We will return next time we are in town!  "
392779,7035659,2013-09-04,7245686,Jess,Very nice apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Very nice/helpful owners.
392779,7677263,2013-09-29,8706378,David,"We had a wonderful week in Seattle in no small part thanks to these lovely accommodations.  As others have said, the facilities are sparkling clean, quiet and very comfortable, and Jyoti is very helpful and an excellent but unobtrusive host.  I highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a home base in Seattle convenient to the freeway and downtown and a 20 minute, convenient drive to the University District.  Terrific."
392779,7967802,2013-10-10,8927615,Travis,"The cozy two bedroom retreat was fantastic for my friend and me. The apartment is very nice and comes with a great setup. It's super close to the light rail that you can take directly into downtown or to/from the airport. 

The host was very nice and was immediately available to us upon our arrival. Highly recommend!"
392779,8061663,2013-10-14,52576,Cb,"I booked this listing for my mother, so I didn't stay directly with Jyoti, but I coordinated/communicated with her throughout the process and she was incredibly kind and patient with our tricky request. My mother also reported that Jyoti's home was beautiful and comfortable, and Jyoti was warm and welcoming. Thank you for being such a great host to my mom!"
392779,8300503,2013-10-24,2850409,Kay,"The apartment was clean and comfortable with everything .
Jyoti was friendly and great host.
If I have meetings in Seattle again, I will absolutely stay here again."
392779,11419893,2014-04-01,1569618,Sheila,"My husband and his business partner were well taken care of and enjoyed Jyoti's hospitality.   They said the location was perfect,  within easy driving distance of everywhere.   Thanks."
392779,12348007,2014-04-29,11581626,Curt,"Two of us were in town for a convention at the downtown convention center.  We stayed five nights at Jyoti's hilltop retreat.  It is everything suggested by the photos.  First it is squeaky clean, we tried to leave it as clean as we found it but that may not be possible.  The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need to make breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The neighborhood is residential, quiet and ten minutes from downtown.  Jyoti is very friendly and upstairs if you need anything.  If you need a two bedroom apartment ten minutes from downtown this may be the best deal in town.  Recommended without reservation.
Curt"
392779,13141777,2014-05-20,5010493,Charisse,Jyoti's place was a great fit for my parents and grandparents who were visiting from out of town. The amenities were great and the place was clean. The location was nice because it is close to the freeway onramp and the house resides in a quiet neighborhood. 
392779,13436725,2014-05-27,2128136,Jess,What a fantastic little place.  It's only minutes away from downtown and is continently location next to I-5 for easy access.  Jyoti was an awesome host and although she wasn't in town for most of our stay she was still available for any questions we had.  I found the neighborhood very safe and well kept.  Next time I'm in Seattle I will definitely look to stay here again!  
392779,18941243,2014-09-03,17059928,Kellinde,"The apartment was excellent!  Well appointed, clean and very welcoming.  The light rail into the city was within walking distance and it was easy to get to the airport from there also."
392779,19089610,2014-09-06,19167332,Gareth,"This was a great place to stay. The apartment was a great size with lots of space. It had all the mod cons you would need. The hosts did warn us about possible noise from young children but I don't recall hearing any noise at all.

We only met Jyoti on entrance to the place, she was very welcoming but we did not need to cointact her any further  throughout our stay as we found everything we needed.

The property is an easy 5 min walk and 10 minute light railway journey to the centre of town.

Would definitely use again!"
392779,19324754,2014-09-10,19394572,Monica,Went to Seattle and used airbnb for the first time and I must say I was impressed. Jyoti was very sweet and informative and location of the house was perfect. I picked Jyoti place because of the great reviews and I'm glad I did. Very clean and cute place if your looking for a place to stay while in Seattle.
392779,19697188,2014-09-16,20533462,Juliane,"We had such a wonderful stay! Great location, everything was very clean and Jyoti and her husband were wonderful! Every time we came back from being out and about in the city it felt like we were coming home. Very cozy and plenty of space. We also loved the decor and they have an epic DVD collection :) I would definately recommend staying here if you are in the Seattle area. Very easy to get in and out of town with the interstates right there. "
392779,20137213,2014-09-24,17257227,Summer,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we were very pleased.

392779,20515865,2014-09-30,18812823,John,"This was my first experience with AirBnB and I was not disappointed. Listing and photos were extremely accurate and the apartment was warm and welcoming every day after 8-10 hours of touring Seattle. Being within short walking distance of the light rail station (which was directly across the street from a grocery store and the local library) was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't get to meet Jyoti, but her husband Tushar was helpful and accommodating. Will be booking here again sometime next year when I return with the entire family."
392779,20970796,2014-10-08,3311753,Barbara,"We loved this place! Great location, easy parking, well kept apartment in beautiful, spotlessly clean condition.  There were plenty of clean towels, supplies for cooking, a much needed bottle of wine on our arrival..so nice. We did hear the gentile pitter patter of baby feet above and a pleasant distant train whistle. It was a calm and peaceful stay. Hosts were very professional, kind and helpful."

Plenty of parking and not too far from the city. We will definitely stay here again when we come back!! Thanks again for the hospitality, Jyoti & Tushar!! :)"

392779,26169565,2015-02-05,23272435,Rebecca,"This my first time booking an airbnb. I do a lot of traveling so to start my experience this trip left a great impression. The plush modern style down stairs apartment was a nice change of scenery from staying in hotels! Jyoti and her husband created a supremely comfortable, eco friendly, and homey environment! My coworker and I had everything we needed the duration of our stay! When we arrived our transition was smooth, quick, and easy. Really clean, and quiet. The house was perfectly located in the heart of Beacon Hill close to the international district, Georgetown (where we were working), and just a few minutes drive from downtown. We even managed to get to the u-district in 10 minutes! There is a small red Apple right down the street, a bakery that makes amazing donuts! And just a few blocks away a growing produce stand where you can't beat the prices. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, I will definitely be back! Thanks again you guys!"
392779,26752795,2015-02-18,11379915,Dean,"Jyoti was an excellent host. We arrived late in the evening; even later than we had planned due to a flight delay, but Jyoti was still very welcoming, and made sure we were comfortable. She even brought us a bottle of wine!

The space was absolutely gorgeous, and VERY clean. The bed was comfortable, and it was easy to feel at home.

What I truly enjoyed was the proximity to downtown Seattle. Since we were close to the I-5, downtown was no more than 15 minutes away. And you can easily get further north to Ballard/Fremont/University of Washington in less than 25. 

Overall, great host, great space, and in a great location. "
392779,28315477,2015-03-22,27291531,Viviana,"Jyoti was a wonderful hostess. She responded quickly to our questions, sent us detailed instructions and came over promptly when we had a small problem in the apartment.  The apartment was clean, light and with everything you need  for a comfortable stay. We stayed 15 days. The neighborhood is quiet, with lots of parking and it was close to our training center. I will for sure rent it again and recommend it to others."
392779,29869141,2015-04-13,30173589,Miranda,"Jyoti's home is perfectly clean, modern, and comfortable. She is a friendly and welcoming host.  My family thoroughly enjoyed their stay in her downstairs apartment and we would happily stay there again. The comfortable bed, full kitchen, and easy-to-control thermostat completed the comfortable experience. We were fortunate to have found this lovely home. Thank you, Jyoti!"
392779,30737056,2015-04-26,31473021,Jay K.,"Excellent, excellent experience!! Jyoti and Tushar were very responsive and had all the instructions laid out in an easy to follow list. The Patels were very friendly and welcoming. The complimentary bottle of wine was a nice, personal touch. The apartment was very clean with plenty of amenities.  Great location, easily accessible from the highway.  Grocery store and several local restaurants and bars within walking distance. Plenty of street parking in a nice, safe and quiet community. Thoroughly enjoyed my time at this property and would definitely recommend this place for others. "
392779,33108375,2015-05-25,30814566,Marisa,"From the adorable, quiet neighborhood to the comfortable, cozy home and the resourceful, friendly owners this place was amazing. This home is conviniently located to where it is easy to navigate to any location you with wish within the city. The home is cute and comfortable with helpful reminders located throughout the place. There was plenty of room for myself and three others. The owners are friendly and are happy to help whenever it is needed. They are super resourceful and have guides as to places to go and see. My trip could not have been any better, with the exception of a longer stay. I'm super pleased."
392779,37736803,2015-07-10,5538497,Greg,Jyoti met us when we got out of our Uber and walked us to her basement apartment. She was very welcoming and chatting with us about the apartment and answered our questions about venues in the neighborhood. Jyoti and her husband had a gift bottle 2011 Menage Trois Chardonnay waiting for us on the apartment's kitchen table.
392779,39011514,2015-07-20,33525475,Andrea,"My family really enjoyed our stay at Jyoti's North Beacon Hill home.  Jyoti and her husband were very helpful with questions I had before our trip.  Their home was our ""home away from home"" for our 10 day stay.  We found the location to be convenient both to public transportation and also to easy access to the highway.  The home was immaculately clean and spacious.  The convenience of both a dishwasher and a washer and dryer were great for an extended stay.  If you stay with Jyoti, don't miss going to Viewpoint Park to check out the spectacular sunsets!"
392779,39933783,2015-07-27,34041018,Tim,Very good overall experience. The place is immaculate and is exactly as advertised. It is conveniently located close to the Link which made traveling to Safeco Field and downtown extremely convenient. I would stay here again.
392779,40894926,2015-08-03,30984717,Rudy,"NIce hosts, Tushar saved us a great deal of trouble one day as we were about to drive to Woodinville for wine tasting and the main expressway was closed due to Seafair, he gave us an alternative.  The place was clean and easy access to public transportation and expressways."
392779,41356417,2015-08-07,1866576,Joe,Jyoti and Tushar were wonderful hosts and made check in and check out very easy for us. The apartment was super clean and comfortable. It is located in a quiet neighborhood where parking was always available.  It was quick and easy for us to get downtown and then be able to return home between sightseeing outings. I would definitely stay here again. 
392779,43035921,2015-08-17,32933271,Shuyun,"Joyti and Tushar are great hosts, the place is well equipped with everything we need during our stay, including local beers in the fridge, fantastic =) there are abundant info regarding nearby places in the house manual, very helpful. Location wise, it's 10-15 minutes drive to major tourist attractions and close to the airport. Strongly recommended!"
392779,46129426,2015-09-08,31907499,Matthew,"Joyce's place was great! She and her husband were both incredibly welcoming and took really good care of us while we were there (one morning they even gave us coffee so we wouldn't have to walk to the grocery store!). The place is exactly as described. Clean, quiet, private... everything you could want. And it's an easy walk to the Light Rail (which makes commuting to downtown a breeze), a great neighborhood bar, a fantastic coffee shop, and a market. A really fantastic experience. Thanks!"
392779,46953393,2015-09-14,20052656,Arnold,"The appartment is a good place to start exploring Seattle. The train from/to the airport and downtown is a 5 minute walk, grocery stores are nearby and there's a couple of interesting places to go for lunch or dinner.
The place is clean and fitted with everything you could need. I didn't meet Jyoti but the communication went smoothly. She provided eggs, bread for breakfast and there was a bottle if wine welcoming us.
Overall an excellent place to stay."
392779,48761737,2015-09-28,28878453,Vijayasimha,"The apartment is almost complete in being a home away from home. Its totally self contained and is thoughtfully stocked with the stuff that one needs in the kitchen, shower and bedrooms. We could have baked a cake; but was just too lazy to get to that. 
Hosts Jyoti and Tushar (and their bubbly baby) were very caring and they were constantly in touch in case we needed anything. 
In our walks around the neighborhood; we came across an Indian cuisine restaurant called ""Travellers Thali"" and found both the atmosphere and food to be fun.
Will definitely like to stay here in my next visit. "
392779,50022547,2015-10-08,32422827,Carlos,Jyoti's home was perfect for our trip to it was walking distance to the tram which takes you downtown. There is a grocery store near by as well where you can stock up on food and supplies. The home was cozy and the beds were comfortable. We would stay here again. 
392779,52651302,2015-10-31,19382101,Christine,"Beautiful little home away from home. The space was conveniently located on quiet street in Beacon Hill area waking distance to transportation, groceries, cafes and restaurants. It had all the home fixings with plenty of amenities.  Jyoti and her husband were so nice and very accommodating on our dates and the space gave us some sense of normalcy during our stay in Seattle. Would definitely stay there again for any future travels. "
392779,53964674,2015-11-15,23351418,Fiona,Jyoti and Tushar are superb hosts and the apartment is very comfortable. Awesome location with easy access to downtown Seattle via light rail link. The coffee in the Station House Cafe was the best coffee I had during my stay in Seattle.
392779,55350269,2015-12-01,3335769,David,"This is a perfect spot for 2 to 4 people who want to stay in a pleasant Seattle residential neighborhood just south of downtown. It is easy to get to from the airport and downtown on public transportation. The Beacon Hill light rail station is about a ten minute walk. On street parking is readily available. Beacon Hill has several restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store within a ten minutes walk of the apartment.

The apartment is a nicely renovated and pristine two bedroom, one bath in-law unit.  It is comfortable, with all new appliances, including a washer and dryer. Jyoti and her husband were very easy to work with. We would certainly stay here again. "
3953365,18462522,2014-08-26,19476601,Ali,"Carol was a great host. This was my first time staying at someone's house and she made it a great one.
She offered me a beer, tried to make my stay comfortable and was very kind and friendly."
3953365,18697016,2014-08-30,8121517,Joshua,Carol was a gracious and friendly host. She even picked me up from the nearby light rail station. 
3953365,18922642,2014-09-02,3501130,Othman,"I am very happy I chose to stay here. Carol was a great host with a wealth of information regarding Seattle; 
she is pleasant and was always accommodating. Very easy going can be relied on if need be. 
The apartment is well-located in nice neighbourhood just 5 min from the Light rail Metro station which goes directly 
to the heart of downtown in 15 minutes. Whether you want to eat out or stay in, that's up to you. The kitchen is equipped with the latest in Stove, Fridge, washer/dryer, microwave, kettle, toaster, various cooking utensils, pots and pans. The room is even equipped and very confortable bed. The shower and bath are also good. The apartment is bathed with lots of light, If I had to describe the room, I would say extremely quiet and no external noise. The room has  really comfy double size bed. Do not hesitate to consider seriously this apartment when you are next in Seattle. I would highly recommend it."
3953365,19105268,2014-09-06,20285114,Sadie,"Carol seemed apprehensive about my hours (working nights, sleeping at her place during the day), but she shouldn't be. Her place was quiet and convenient, and although we didn't interact much, she seemed nice. Highly recommended. "
3953365,19451982,2014-09-12,182513,Alex,"Great host!  Nice clean room, very organized approach to the rental (keys to private room, wifi info printed out, clean towles, etc.)

Carol was very nice.  She told me all about the neighbourhood and even drove me to a restaurant.  

Great rental experience all around."
3953365,19897420,2014-09-20,18892103,Bjarne,"Hi Carol.
Thanks for some great days at your place.
Enjoyed it.

Bjarne 
"
3953365,20058458,2014-09-22,2995016,Allen,"Carol's place was clean, comfortable, and very convenient to Seattle's light rail system. I was pleased that she let me check my luggage in early making my first days stay much easier to sightsee. Carol was a good host and had light snacks available 24/7. My experience at her place was great and more pleasurable than the hotel I stayed in the previous 3 days while on business in Bellevue. I recommend her place and will book with her again on my next visit. The only inconvenience was some late night noise at a neighbor’s house easily resolved with ear plugs."
3953365,20799274,2014-10-05,20742898,Patricia,Perfect place for a good night's sleep. 
3953365,21068383,2014-10-10,22128989,Nele,Carol was a wonderful host. She did everything to make me feel comfortable and at home and had great information to share about Seattle. She provided snacks and a nice breakfast with fresh coffee. It was lovely to sit in her garden at night. Her house is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. This is the best Airbnb experience I have ever had and I would recommend anyone to stay with Carol and she is lovely. 
3953365,21273085,2014-10-13,22405629,Russell,carol was a great host.  was able to accomodate my last minute reservation.  the place was as described and close to the light rail which made getting into the city a breeze.  
3953365,21402197,2014-10-16,20870530,Estan,"Clean and tidy. Value for money. A very green neighborhood with some house spiders on some of the trees here and there but that is typical of Seattle. Location is close to Downtown Seattle.

Carol has prepared all the information on a piece of paper so we didn't talk much when I arrived. I feel she warms up to people after a while as we started chatting on the next day at breakfast. She also drives me to light rail station near her place as she was also going to get some grocery.

Carol smokes at her backyard and brings in the cigarette butt to throw inside the dustbin. I am a social smoker so I am fine and think this is considerate to others more than enough. Non-smoker may want to think twice if this is not acceptable to you."
3953365,21789123,2014-10-24,18283470,Jaimie,"Carol was such a gracious host. The house was very clean. She left me towels and everything she said was provided. I was able to do some laundry. Thank you for that Carol. The bed was super comfortable. The backyard was beautiful and Carol went out of her way to help me around. All in all, for my first AirBnb experience it was the best I could hope for.  It was close to the LINK station and easily accessible form downtown Seattle.  "
3953365,21957282,2014-10-27,15447372,Johnathon,"I stayed with Carol for one night while traveling through Washington. I'm a non-smoker, but she keeps the place very clean and only smokes outside. She provided everything as advertised and was very accommodating. I was planning on walking around Beacon Hill and spending the evening to myself, but we started to chat after I got settled in and she ended up taking me to some of the cool local spots and keeping me company. She lives in a neat part of town and I had a lot of fun. I wish I had more time to explore the area, but it was a great start. I will definitely consider staying with her again if I come back to Seattle in the future."
3953365,22875591,2014-11-16,2303490,Ben,Host was very generous. I enjoyed my stay.
3953365,22940097,2014-11-17,2303490,Ben,Great host
3953365,23619412,2014-12-06,20938014,Will,"Carol's place is ordinary household but very (very) clean and located at the center of Seattle, making travel to anywhere snap. 5 min to QFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, and lightrail (Mt baker st.). The only difficulty I had was that water knob was kinda odd (just start turning it on from cold water to prevent any incident) and she wouldn't let me stay longer LOL. (She has to know she is more likable than she thinks :-)"

3953365,24686010,2015-01-01,24197342,Kevin,"Carol has a large immaculate house with comfortable furniture and interesting art and furnishings.  In the summer her backyard would be a delightful place to relax.  I have stayed with Carol 3 times now and always enjoy my stays.  It works well for me because I work in downtown Seattle and it's only about a 15 minute bus ride to a stop about a block from my office.   Carols house is also filled with bookshelves on many subjects, with a focus on literature.  I found this especially enjoyable."
3953365,24860604,2015-01-03,23793023,Raine,"Carol was a great hostess! She was home when I arrived and gave me the tour of her place. I was only in town for about 24 hours to attend a friend's wedding, but she's very accommodating, a fun conversationalist and was really helpful by making suggestions for places in the area. And the bed is super comfy! Overall, my stay was very pleasant! Thanks, Carol :)"
3953365,25256079,2015-01-10,6933721,Shane,Carol was very nice and had great energy!  Here place was very clean and in a nice quite neighborhood!  I would highly recommend her home to others.  
3953365,25428716,2015-01-15,17409488,Eveline,"I stayed one night at Carol's house. Carol was very good at communicating prior to my arrival. Within 30 minutes of checking in at Carol's house, we had quite an interesting conversation about life and healthcare in this country! I enjoyed having Carol as my host. She is kind and friendly. One thing, however, is that I did notice the house has a light scent of cigarettes (however I am VERY sensitive to the smell) but the room I stayed in was fine. Carol does not smoke in the house and I never saw any ashtrays or any traces of cigarettes, just smell. It didn't bother me during my short stay. A previous reviewer had said that there was no scent at all, but I did smell it. Overall my stay with Carol was pleasant and the house and room were clean. She is very fun to talk to. I would stay with her again. "

3953365,25797362,2015-01-26,7431141,Linus Ik-Pyo,Carol received me with warm welcome. The room is exactly the same as what is described. The neighborhood is very safe and green.
3953365,30364167,2015-04-20,10565402,Christopher,"The house is great - clean, comfortable, plenty of space. It's about a ten minute walk from the Mount Baker light rail station and is in a quiet residential neighborhood. Carol is cool and looks forward to interacting with guests and helping out with whatever you may reasonably request."
3953365,32219371,2015-05-15,33199709,Michael,"Friendly and welcoming host, house was located in a quiet residential neighbourhood in between two Metro/Light Rail stations. Room was very nice, exactly as listed"
3953365,32433320,2015-05-17,29930471,Sai,"It was a great experience stay at this apartment and I do think it was one of my wisest choice I have even made. Not only the house is of great location and the room is huge and clean, Carol is very kind and warm hearted person. Knowing I  was leaving the city later in the afternoon, she was willing to drive my to some place I would like to visit, recommending good coffee place and helping me to kill time before my depart (that was a pleasant talk). Thanks to Carol's assistant and help, I have a lot more pleasant and easy trip. I will definitely stay at Carol's place if I am back to down and highly recommended."
3953365,33213220,2015-05-25,4495782,Markus,"Carol is a wonderful and very considerate host. She is a great networker of her guests and tries to make your stay as nice and interesting as you want it to be. Ask her about great places to eat - she knows them all ;-)

I stayed with her twice - once before, and then after a training I attended in Seattle. Her place is a short walk away from the light rail, which connects you directly to the airport.

I definitely recommend her.

3953365,34830456,2015-06-12,35255876,Kendra,"Carol was a very welcoming host.  I received a warm greeting, she showed me to my room, and gave me a quick tour.  Unfortunately I was in town for a seminar and upon my arrival at Carol's, I was in a hurry to get to the event.  The room was clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable!! I was very busy with the event so really only slept and showered at Carol's but every time I was running out the door, she had coffee, tea, and snacks readily available. The neighborhood seemed nice but I wasn't able to explore so I can't really speak much to that.  "
3953365,35249452,2015-06-16,34595518,Sam,"I had an excellent time at Carol's place.  The room was everything I needed and the location was great.  I had rented a car and quickly found that parking in Seattle can be something of an ordeal, but Carol's house is located towards the end of a dead end street with so few houses on it that you'll always have a place to park for the night.  If you don't have a car, it's still totally possible to walk to some major hotspots, like the sports stadiums.  All in all I had a great time!"
3953365,35834285,2015-06-22,34505808,Srikant,"Carol was an excellent host. She was warm, welcoming and made my stay comfortable. Her place is very clean and exactly the same as in the photos.

Thank you, Carol. Cheers!"

There was breakfast provided to which we helped ourselves. there was juice, bagels and bread, coffee and nut bars, as well as there being various fruit available to which i could help myself.

we could use the garden and i have to say i felt at home straightaway, Carol is an interesting person and i enjoyed our conversations always.  Highly recommended."

Would definitely stay here again next time I visit seattle
3953365,37723350,2015-07-09,37784550,Darron,"Carol was my first Airbnb host, and provided a great first experience for me.  Carol was very welcoming and easy to talk to.  My room was exactly as described, clean, and comfortable.

Sometimes, it's the small things that can go a long way.  I had been lugging a lot of stuff around, which worked me a little bit and made very thirsty.  After I got all my stuff in my room, Carol offered me a bottle of water, which I accepted and grabbed from the fridge. The water was *ice* cold, and the most refreshing drink I've had in a long while.  It really cooled me down, and helped me get settled for a great night's rest.

The next morning, I had a great shower with the use of clean, cozy towels. I wanted to get an early start in the office, so I left pretty early via Uber, which got me downtown in about 10 minutes; a great location if you have business (or pleasure) in Downtown.

For the price, Carol offers a hard-to-beat deal!"
3953365,38207090,2015-07-13,37483942,Wang,"The house is exactly as described. Clean, convenient and comfortable. It does take a few minutes to walk from light rail station, but Carol's description is very clear, which makes it very easy to  find. Carol is kind, considerate and communicative, I enjoyed a number of conversations we had very much. Thanks Carol, for making my stay in Seattle such a pleasant one!"

3953365,42478002,2015-08-13,37191257,Kit,Carol was a great host and very accommodating.  The house / room were exactly as described and it was a nice stay.   I took a morning jog to Beacon hill for some great views of the port and the city.
3953365,42968508,2015-08-16,35305589,思凡(Sifan),"I really enjoy my stay here. The house is cozy,clean, and comfortable. The most important thing is that Carol is the best host I have ever met! She is nice and considerate. She is also a good chatting partner. I think we would be good friends if I could stay here longer. Carol, hope to meet you again next time I come back to Seattle!"
3953365,43103285,2015-08-17,10159684,Howard,"Carol's space was exactly as advertised and I had a great AirBnB experience staying there. The room, and the rest of the house as well were very neat and clean. It was also very quiet, calm and comfortable. The proximity to downtown Seattle was great and Carol was the perfect host! She was kind, helpful, patient and forgiving despite my blunders and mistakes. I highly recommend staying there. Thank you, Carol! "
3953365,44875491,2015-08-29,40656423,Athina,"Although a work emergency made me stay 4 entire days almost exclusively at home, Carol made me feel welcome at all times. The listing description was very accurate. The neighborhood was also exactly as described: quiet and peaceful, near the Light Train station and less than 10' by car from one of the most lively neighborhoods of Seattle. "
3953365,46095271,2015-09-07,43291314,Yu,"Thanks Carol, make a warm trip."
3953365,46227674,2015-09-08,22657709,Dabin,It was my first time using AirBnb. I was lucky to meet Carol in Seattle! She is nice and fun. We had nice small talking and she bring me some tourist attractions cause of non-organized my plan. I feel great thank to Carol for everything in Seattle .
3953365,47902597,2015-09-21,22821096,Bj,"Carol was a great host. The room was very comfortable, warm, and had enough room for me. The bathroom had everything I needed - towels, toothpaste, floss, shampoo & soap. Carol was very welcoming and easy to communicate with everything I needed. I rented a car for the weekend and her spot is about 5 minutes away from freeway access. For a small fee, she drove me to downtown Seattle, where parking is expensive and such a hassle. I would recommend her place for any individual with a car rental and wanting some distance from downtown. "
3953365,50885309,2015-10-15,11346179,Lilimar,"Home is in perfect location. Walking distance to light rail. Carol was extremely accommodating to make my stay more comfortable. My flight out was very early, she woke up to offer me coffee."
3953365,54446399,2015-11-20,35018747,Elvira,"Carol went above and beyond to make my stay in her home comfortable. The space was exactly as pictured and was very clean. The bed especially was incredibly comfortable; I almost didn't want to get up in the morning and leave it.
The location of her home is excellent. It is between two light rail stations; one uphill from the listing and one downhill, so you can ensure that you're walking downhill to and from her place wherever you go. This made it very easy for me to get to her from the airport with a 50lb suitcase in tow, without having to spend money on a taxi or an Uber; I simply took the light rail from the airport to Beacon Hill station, and made a 10 minute walk downhill to her home. Carol's home is close enough to downtown to make transportation very easy and affordable, yet removed enough to save money on renting and to offer a quiet and peaceful environment.
Carol is an excellent host. She provided plenty of breakfast food and beverages for me, and even gave me a lift to a few of my destinations during my Seattle visit. She has a lot of great insights and suggestions on what to do in the city, and is a pleasure to chat with, but will also be happy to give you space and privacy when you need it.
I strongly recommend booking Carol's listing. As a solo traveler on a budget, it fit my needs perfectly, and her hospitality made my stay exceptional."
3953365,58049046,2015-12-31,45461426,Taryn,Wonderful welcome for a tired traveler.  The room and bed were beyond comfortable!  Carol was very sweet and made sure I had everything I needed.
2500188,11387263,2014-03-31,11775731,Betsy,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay.  It was a beautiful house in a great neighborhood with off-street parking.  It was very easy to get around.
Kimber made delicious breakfasts, and was very helpful.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms felt spacious.  We felt right at home.
We would definitely stay here again, and look forward to our next trip. I would highly recommend it!
"
2500188,11971574,2014-04-20,2806015,Jeremy,This place fantastic. It is in a great location in the city and it is a quiet retreat. The host was very gracious and the room was comfortable and nice. 
2500188,13256624,2014-05-23,15437449,Beixi,"This is a great experience! The inn is at a perfect location. The neighborhood is quiet and pretty. Bus to downtown is just 3-minute walking away. There is a Safeway nearby. 
The house impressed me so much by how clean and tidy it is! The housekeepers are friendly and helpful! They definitely offer some great breakfast! They make me feel comfortable and they definitely make the inn like a home to live.
I highly recommend this place! I will absolutely live there again next time when I am in Seattle!
"
2500188,14657236,2014-06-23,9358055,Ryan,Fantastic and unique experience with some awesome hosts! Thank you!
2500188,14842666,2014-06-27,6386373,Jose Eduardo,the neighborhood was really nice
2500188,15280951,2014-07-06,16927806,Lilian,"Excellent B&B, walking distance to major attractions (about 40 min to Pike Place). Comfortable rooms and clean bathrooms. Carrie is a very friendly host and makes a great breakfast. Would stay here again."
2500188,15776328,2014-07-15,7078230,Calder,"Carrie and Adele were very helpful. The house is indeed walking distance from the heart of Capitol Hill, and a bus line two blocks away takes you into downtown. The building is lovingly decorated and very well maintained. Carrie is an AMAZING cook and made us two of the best breakfasts I've ever tasted anywhere."
2500188,16109697,2014-07-22,5600480,Lynette,"I chose this B&B for a 4 night trip because of the excellent location and this B&B did not disappoint.  I couldn't have made a better choice!
The B&B is situated in a beautiful part of the City, quiet but close to everything Seattle has to offer.

Right from the start with our first mail contact about reservations up to our last day in Seattle I felt very well taken care off.  I enjoyed the familiar atmosphere at breakfast and the contact with Shannon and the staff a lot. 

I hope to be back in Seattle soon and certainly we will choose this B&B again!"
2500188,16817018,2014-08-03,12362621,Hayley,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2500188,17454211,2014-08-12,14035480,Joseph,"Had a great stay here with my girlfriend. Very clean, safe , would stay again. And great breakfast !"
2500188,18499394,2014-08-27,6464985,Laura,"This is a very clean, quiet and well managed house. The location is in a quiet street (great if you need silence to sleep) but you can easily walk to restaurants and bars in about 15 minutes. It's safe to walk even at nights. Breakfasts are great! An even if you need to get up earlier than breakfast time, they provide you with breakfast to go. Guests do not have access to the kitchen at night so take that into account if you plan to cook your own dinner. For my husband and I this was a great place to stay. We will definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Seattle and we will recommend this place to our friends. "
2500188,18953648,2014-09-03,15433838,John,"Excellent comfortable room, great breakfast and coffee, and quiet peaceful location.  Recommended."
2500188,21670307,2014-10-21,19662120,Richard,"We stayed for 3 nights. We were welcomed when we arrived, shown our room and given information on things like front door access, wi-fi, etc. Our room was on the 2nd floor and had access to a sweet balcony. By American standards, the room was a bit small for two, comparable to an average European guest room. It was well-maintained and the bed was comfortable. Two spotless bathrooms, with stand-up showers are in the hall. We were the only guests at the B+B during our entire stay, so of course it was very quiet. The second floor has about 6 guestrooms, plus there are two more on the third floor, so I'm sure it can be lively when full. 
Incredible hearty breakfasts were served to us each morning by delightful Oksana - Eggs Benedict, Bailey's French Toast, like that.
Another terrific feature of the B+B is the off-street parking around back. In this neighborhood, that's a big plus. Capitol Hill/ Hilltop is a happening area, so lots of restaurants and clubs around. One negative - the only one - is that Capital Hill is right under a landing approach lane for SeaTac, so in the early evening especially there will be some jet noise overhead. Dies off about 11 pm.
Overall this is a lovely house, staffed by friendly professional hosts offering good value for accommodation in Seattle. We will without doubt stay here again when we return to Seattle.
"
2500188,22570004,2014-11-09,9162978,Michela,"I loved every thing about my stay. Shannon was easy to communicate with and took my call late at night when I couldn't locate the key pad for entering the house. Oksana is an incredible chef and cooked breakfast for us. Breakfast menu was so good, I have to share it: 
- Blueberry pancakes
- Bacon 
- Scrambled eggs 
- Coffee or tea
- Fresh baked pumpkin bread
- Cereal variations
- Fresh cut Pineapple 

When I returned from afternoon meetings on Friday the whole house smelled amazing like fresh baked cookies - which tasted even better than they smelled. The rooms were clean and tidy and there was plenty of space to unpack and settle in. They moved me to a bigger room on the second day and it had a cool view of downtown. The bathrooms were very tidy and I hardly knew there was other tenants besides when we all sat for breakfast. Another major plus on the bathrooms was a heat timer so when you step out of the shower, there was no sense of being nippy. I will be staying here again on future visits! "
2500188,28753271,2015-03-29,19749680,Shelby,"Had a great stay here! The host- Oksana was really welcoming and kind. Our room was as pictured and we had a bathroom all to ourselves. The bed was comfy and the room included an ac unit in case you get a little warm. Also TV was nice to have- especially if you need this while falling asleep! It was great to be able to wake up and have breakfast ready. Coffee, orange juice, yogurt parfaits, and other sorts of breads an cereals gave us energy to start the day and explore the city. Oksana was great with recommendations and there were maps and city guides available to help you with your touring. All around really nicely located in the heart of Capitol Hill. Such great restaurants and bars in the area! Definitely recommend this bed and breakfast. "
2500188,31719864,2015-05-09,5435223,Oliver,"We stayed 8 nights at this private driven B&B and were highly satisfied with our choice. The entire house is very clean and in a very good shape, our room was a little bit small for two persons, but nicely furnished and quite. The entire B&B has roughly 6 rooms and we were lucky that there were nearly no other guests in that time. There were 2 shared baths on our floor, which were clean and bright. However, if the B&B is fully booked longer waiting times for showering and toilets are likely to occur in the morning. 

The B&B is located in Capitol Hill, a lively, young and exiting neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars and shops. This neighborhood as well as the entire Seattle city area are very safe and we hardly saw any police on the street. Public transport was fine since different bus lines can be reached within 5 minutes of walking, a bus to the city center took roughly 15-20 minutes.  Also, there is a free parking lot at the back of the house which we could use for our rental car. This was a real bonus since the parking situation in Capitol Hill was really stressed. 

We didn’t meet the owner of the B&B (Shannon), but her housekeeper Oksana. She was a wonderful host for us with a lot of valuable recommendations for lunch & diner, cultural events and general ideas for our days in Seattle. She provided a very good breakfast each morning, was easy to talk with and had a lots of exiting stories from her own world-wide journeys. We really enjoyed our conversations with her at the breakfast table. Unfortunately, Oksana will leave Seattle soon, but we hope for future guests that the new housekeeper is as great as Oksana.  

Summarizing, we highly recommend this B&B to other AirBnB users as a suitable basis for exploring Seattle. 
"
2500188,38311541,2015-07-14,154593,Artem,"The neighborhood was very quiet and beautiful. It was actually a short walk away from everything I wanted to see. The room was in an impeccable shape and was kept very tidy by the house staff. The staff were very courteous and accommodating. They also laid out very clear instructions for getting settled late at night, as our flight came in at midnight.

Basically it was everything I could have ever asked for in an AirBnB."
2500188,39543415,2015-07-24,16972717,Evan,"The hosts made our first time in Seattle incredibly comfortable. They arranged to be present when we arrived, welcomed us warmly, provided maps, fresh water, and snacks... and this was before we even got to our room. The bedroom was extremely cozy. Breakfast was simple and delicious. Everyone who worked there was accommodating and kind. The neighborhood was in walking distance to anything you could want to see."
2500188,41409857,2015-08-07,37628867,Muran,"Me and my girlfriend stayed for 4 nights. The entire house is well-maintained, and the room is tidy and extremely cozy, although a little bit small for 2 people. The neighborhood is quiet and the bus stop is in walking distance, which is convenient. Breakfast is simple and delicious. House staff prepare fresh lemon water and biscuits or chocolate in the house for guests. We really enjoy our staying here."
2500188,42408752,2015-08-13,15652165,David,"We had a great time at this BnB.  The hosts were very responsive when we needed something and gave us space when we wanted our privacy.  Excellent location at a relatively low price, the walk to downtown is quite doable, and it's right on some bus lines that go straight downtown if you don't feel like it.  

The room was a bit cozy (the one picture shows pretty much everything), but it was sufficient for our needs.  Also, the bathrooms are shared between all the guests, but there are at least 3 of them, so we were always able to find one that was available when we needed it."
2500188,45838531,2015-09-06,41569696,Cory,"We loved staying here! The house was beautiful and very well maintained. It was on a leafy quiet street, within reasonable walking distance to restaurants. The sitting room was comfy and welcoming, Emma was friendly and helpful, and the included breakfast was simple and healthy, with consideration given to various dietary needs. There was free parking, as well! 

Our room was small, but very comfortable, with everything we needed, including extra linens, WiFi, a tv, and daily ""room fluffing and tidying"".

The bathrooms were shared, but that was not a problem at all.

One tiny negative - the house definitely needs more outside lighting at night. It was extremely hard to find after dark, and if we hadn't had a flashlight, it would have been really hard to navigate up the steep front stairs or enter the code for the lock."
2500188,48575078,2015-09-27,24050176,Aaron,I had a really great time at the B&B. The room was well furnished and even had a box fan! The bed was comfortable. I slept with the windows open and was perfectly comfortable. 
2500188,50599253,2015-10-12,6179815,Cody Allen,"The room was great; exactly as it looked in the photos, and Shannon was extremely personable, kind, and interesting to speak with.

I would without reservation recommend others to stay here."
2500188,52769244,2015-11-01,19235033,Billy,Lovely B&B- quiet and removed from street noise but close to great restaurants. I stayed by myself but would be great for travelers or couples visiting town. Also a great price considering it includes breakfast. Great hosts.
3677729,18852045,2014-09-01,20516493,Chip,"Margaret is an amazing host and embodies the best of welcoming guests to all that is Seattle!  Her home is beautiful, clean, and the back garden is a welcome respite after a long day of seeing Seattle. A fresh bottle of cold spring water was in my room each night - nice touch - and the bathroom was spacious and emmaculate! :-) 

The home's location is ideally situated in the Mt. Baker area. It's an easy, 5 minute walk to Lake Washington, where there is a beautiful walking path around the lake, with views of Mt. Ranier, a 10 minute walk the opposite direction to the metro rail to downtown, or a 3 minute walk to the local bus stop (and the public transports are great).  Or, you can cab it to downtown in 7-10 minutes for less than $15.  Oh yes, each morning I took a 5 minute walk to a local Seattle Coffee Shop (no, not Starbucks), where the breakfast sandwiches are to die for - a real egg soufflé w/ special cheese is used - and the coffee is PERFECT!  There is also a wonderful, friendly, neighborhood home-style Italian restaurant across the street - ""That's Amore"" - for dinner and they have a great wine list. I HIGHLY recommend staying with Margaret."
3677729,20533425,2014-09-30,1465456,Ben,Margaret and her husband were great hosts. The place is unique and relatively close to downtown Seattle. Great stay and would highly recommend staying here. 
3677729,22631631,2014-11-10,23358483,Elisabeth,"Unser Aufenthalt bei Margaret war rundum perfekt. Sie hat uns von Beginn an sehr herzlich aufgenommen, sodass wir uns trotz des kurzen Aufenthalts ""wie zu Hause"" gefühlt haben. Das Haus, Zimmer und Bad sind genauso wie auf den Fotos sehr gemütlich, sauber und schön, auch das Frühstück war sehr gut. Mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln (mehrere Buslinien fahren in diesen Stadtteil) ist das Haus sehr leicht und in etwa 20-30 Minuten von Downtown aus zu erreichen. Wir würden diese Unterkunft auf alle Fälle weiterempfehlen und wenn wir wieder nach Seattle reisen ohne zu zögern wieder Margarets Zimmer buchen!"
3677729,31320794,2015-05-04,16415461,Carol,"What a perfect place to stay! A beautiful QUIET neighborhood, roomy, comfortable room and common areas, and a gracious, friendly host. It looked and sounded really good on Airbnb's site, but it's much better. Mass transit not far, on street parking out front. Next time we're heading for Seattle, we'll check with Margaret via Airbnb first."
3677729,31784364,2015-05-10,1844619,Megan,"Margaret welcomed my in-laws when we had to find some over-flow room! Here is their review:

We have just returned from spending two nights at Margaret Opalka's home in the Mt. Baker neighborhood of Seattle, WA.  The house just happened to be directly across the street from where my son and family live making it extremely convenient for my husband and myself to shuttle back and forth constantly. Along with that wonderful convenience, our bedroom was lovely with a bathroom right outside it? The queen-size bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Margaret is a very friendly person who makes sure you wake up to the smell of coffee each morning. She also leaves a light on for you each evening. We'd definitely stay there again."
3677729,34350710,2015-06-07,34237640,Ciara,"I absolutely loved Margaret's home. It's as warm and inviting as it is pictured. My friend and I were easily charmed by the colorful walls, the rustic furniture and of course the host herself. The home is located at a neighborhood that's pretty much next to everything. Down the street is lake washington, dinner and drinks are a couple of blocks north and the place is also close by the 90 if you plan on making a quick ""backcountry"" escape away from Seattle. We wish we had actually stayed a bit longer. The company was great and I appreciate that we actually got to spend some time talking a bit about the house, about our trip and Margaret even threw in some great recommendations for us (like walk down the lake and go to Bottlehouse for dinner). She was flexible when it came to checking in and out so we didnt have to worry too much about getting stuck in traffic or running late or getting lost. It was a great pleasure being her guest, will definitely be back!"
3677729,34560577,2015-06-09,20232607,Rachael,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Seattle.  Margaret was very welcoming and recommended a cafe to go to that was walking distance and was very good.  She greeted us with a carafe of cold water and 2 glasses for the bedroom which was very refreshing after a long drive.  The room and bathroom are perfect, lots of charm and gorgeous antiques mixed in with the fresh and fashionable, clean, and comfortable.  "
3677729,35319774,2015-06-17,4204072,Julia,"I had such a lovely stay with Margaret! Her home is beyond beautiful - cozy and artfully designed, so it feels like home right away to any traveler. Her yard is AMAZING - beautiful, expansive, and wild. The house is close to both rail and bus, which makes everything in the city very convenient. It's also not a bad walk into downtown. Margaret made the second room available, and was fine with a second friend staying for a night with a very very minimal charge. The rooms were comfortable, well lit, and always had fresh delicious Seattle water. I cannot rate this highly enough."
3677729,35546756,2015-06-20,7706557,Emily,"We had a lovely but short stay at Margaret's. Would definitely go back again! The house was charming, and we enjoyed relaxing in the beautiful backyard. Margaret and Pat were perfect hosts, and the location was very convenient to public transit."
3677729,39797316,2015-07-26,36669595,Seylah,"The house was so beautiful, comfortable, and quiet.  I'm a local in Seattle, and wanted to celebrate my birthday at a nice airbnb because my roommate had out of town guests- so we needed a getaway!  We could not have been more pleased.  Gorgeous, colorful furniture, a room that stays cool in summer, roku box for streaming tv and movies, and a lovely garden.  Margaret herself is very authentic and friendly, up for conversation but also good for introverts like us who were looking for peace and quiet :)  We also loved the thoughtful touch of muffins and coffee in the morning, which we enjoyed in her garden.  She even bought butter because she was out and remembered that I liked it better than jam. We would certainly come back and were a little sad to leave!  Highly recommended. "
3677729,40115789,2015-07-28,6878263,Gordon,"wonderful stay at the Seattle Bungalow, hosted by Margaret Opalka. We loved our stay in this beautiful  home and upscale neighbourhood. 
The location was perfect, close to the rapid transit, easy walking ,  for access to downtown areas. 
Margaret was an awesome host.

3677729,44487811,2015-08-26,37735461,Chanel,So homey and welcoming! I want to make my home like hers- full of life and comfort. Margaret is absolutely lovely herself and was the perfect host for my mom and I.  So thankful for the stay!
3677729,45297366,2015-09-01,26758660,Jeanne,"Margaret was able to be home when we arrived to greet us and show us around the house and her beautiful yard. Everything was very clean and beautifully arranged to make us feel quite at home. She was also very helpful with directions to various places in this quiet, walkable neighborhood. Our first morning, we found homemade muffins for breakfast! This location is convenient for catching the light rail and buses in to Seattle, the airport, and surrounding neighborhoods. We were so happy in every way with our host Margaret!!!

3677729,45550077,2015-09-04,27989262,John,"A warm welcome, pleasant stay with clean room. Easy access to downtown on bus 14.  Close to Washington lake and good quality restaurants.  Thank you Pat for picking us up from the train station. "
3677729,48042078,2015-09-22,44099247,G Fred,Margaret was extremely personable and went out of her way to make our stay very enjoyable.  Her home is better than described and she is a terrific host.  The neighborhood is very picturesque!

Chris was more than helpful and had very good communication.

I would rent this Air bnb again.
"
8783900,54653997,2015-11-22,48716663,Tommy,"Tom has a fantastic space available here for an extremely affordable price in the area (Madrona).  The people I traveled with were blown away with where we were staying (and the price).  Tom was quickly responsive to all inquiries, incredibly accommodating to our travel schedule and even threw in some thoughtful, personal touches that made our time in Seattle a great experience.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Centrally located in an area just outside of Capitol Hill, you get the experience of a quiet hideaway just outside the more popular areas of the city.  "
7291403,39233645,2015-07-21,31701920,Alyssa,Our stay was great. Peter made everything very easy and was accommodating especially for a last minute booking. I would recommend!

The condo was as promised, Peter was responsive and helpful, and the stay was a short drive to the Seattle city center for sightseeing. The patio overlooking the water was wonderful for morning coffee and for dining after a busy day in the city."
5047188,26145996,2015-02-04,26999893,Karen,"I booked this room for two nights for my adult daughter, who needed a place to stay in Seattle. My daughter booked on her own for another week beyond that. She reports that Liping is a wonderful host, bright, sweet, and welcoming. The room and apartment are clean and inviting. "

8173487,46107432,2015-09-07,43369411,Ari,Leroy was an amazing host! He was extremely accommodating when I booked for one night and then immediately changed my mind wanted to extend my stay another night. He stocked his refrigerator with appetizers and drinks for the 5 of us staying. I don't have enough praise for this host. I would most definitely go back! The view was incredible and very close to fun bars/restaurants. Two thumbs up! 
8173487,55408732,2015-12-01,751416,Erna,"The place is awesome, and the location is great as well. Nice kitchen, comfortable beds, off street parking, great views. However, the heat did not work, and it was below freezing outside! Leroy responded by text, offering to pay for a space heater, which we bought, and he did pay for it, in addition to $40 extra. However, the penthouse is really too big to be heated by a space heater, and we never were comfortable, temperature-wise. Additionally, the shower head in the master bathroom was unusable, it hung straight down, next to the wall, with water coming straight down from about the 5 feet level. And finally, there is no window covering in the second bedroom, although the window of the opposing apartment is a mere 15 feet away! I asked Leroy by email if he was going to fix these things, because the location is great for us, but I haven't had a response yet. If he does, I would love to stay here again!"
2150760,10996354,2014-03-16,2316057,Jen,"Michelle was kind and accepted a last minute reservation. A great place to stay for a night. Lovely off garden location. Comfortable. Easy parking. Thank you, Michelle."
2150760,13395243,2014-05-26,496430,Kathie,"We stayed in Michelle's cottage for one night and found we had everything we needed.  The pictures listed do not show the beautiful garden outside the front door and windows.  The bed was cozy and we woke to the sound of birds.  Very peaceful and relaxing!  A very short drive away was a little organic market and a few minutes further we found an amazing waterfront park with running trails, BBQ spots, beach, and kids play area.  A wonderful spot that we hope to visit again when we have more time to explore further. "
2150760,13722661,2014-06-02,13868433,Amanda,Michelle's MIL cottage was a perfect quiet getaway for my stay in Seattle --- it was so serene and peaceful. The location is in a charming neighborhood with access to a wonderful park nearby. I also found several coffee shop options within a few miles. I did not meet Michelle but she was very accommodating and accepted a last minute stay. I will stay again!
2150760,13891116,2014-06-07,5053141,Ellis,"We stayed for a few days mid-week.  The apartment is clean and the bed was
amazingly comfortable.  The apartment is a totally separate building in the
backyard/garden and has a high ceiling over most of the main living area.
The apartment includes an armoire with drawers and shelving for clothes, a
kitchenette with a half-size fridge and full stove, and a modern tub/shower.
Communication with our host was straightforward.  We would definitely stay
here again!"
2150760,14215801,2014-06-14,8894629,Luna,"We had a wonderful stay at Michelle's guest house. The neighborhood is full of charming old gardens and not far from the lakeside parks. We slept well on the comfortable bed, and enjoyed having our own bathroom and kitchenette. As it was just a quick overnight trip (in late, left early) we didn't meet Michelle, but her consideration to detail was evident in small touches such as scented candled. She kept in touch with us and Derek got us checked in. We recommend the Seward Park Mother in Law!"
2150760,14717296,2014-06-24,16834072,Carrie,This was the perfect spot to spend some quiet time and explore Seattle. It was the perfect spot for an early morning run along Lake Washington and Seward Park.  There is a great burger joint just a couple blocks away as well as a PCC grocery.  
2150760,14849247,2014-06-27,231013,Margarita,"Michelle went above and beyond to accommodate me very last minute. My flight was super late and it was so nice to arrive to everything super clean, and lovely, linens, perfect bed, etc.  Location was great."
2150760,15126915,2014-07-02,17102524,Sherri,"This was a great place to stay! Great location, felt safe, clean, quiet, really enjoyed our time here! Highly recommend for its convenience and overall at-home experience."
2150760,15944721,2014-07-18,17424376,Jerome,The place was very nice and Michele was a very gracious host.  We would be happy to stay with her again.
2150760,15994437,2014-07-19,18023331,Nate,"Michelle was very friendly.  The place is very pleasant. It has personality to it, felt like home. Wish to stay little longer."
2150760,16263309,2014-07-24,17376391,Jane,"This was a lovely, private, quiet place to stay, provided by a friendly and helpful host.  It's walking distance to interesting shops and good food in the Columbia City neighborhood - 15 minutes, and just a little farther to the light rail, which we enjoyed using to go into Seattle and to the airport.  Seward Park is a beautiful place to hike to also, if you're looking for an exercise walk with a water view, and there's a whole foods co-op just a few blocks away.  I hope to have a chance to stay here again!"
2150760,16320150,2014-07-25,16969174,Lily,"Michelle was great! Very easy to communicate with and left a note in the cabin with detailed instructions. We arrived late and she left the door unlocked and keys on the counter. 
Everything was perfectly clean, quiet and exactly what we needed for the night!! The neighborhood is very close to the airport and there is easy access to downtown Seattle. Plus a great grocery store, coffee shops and restaurants near by. 

A great place to stay!! "
2150760,16843842,2014-08-03,4679678,Edward,"Very pleasant place.  Michelle was most helpful and we found the experience most satisfying.  I would stay here again.  
"
2150760,17103556,2014-08-07,17216381,Mark,"This is a lovely, clean cottage/apartment on a quiet block in a great neighborhood. It is small, which was perfect for the two of us."
2150760,17762455,2014-08-17,17216381,Mark,"This was an excellent experience. The small apartment is quiet, separate from the main house, set in the back yard. It is well-appointed, with everything one or two people could need. The host made everything simple & easy. Because we were returning to old haunts, this neighborhood was perfect for us. For those visiting Seattle the first time, you should really check out this part of town. It is more relaxed, easy-going & friendly.  And it's right by Seward Park, one of the most lovely walking parks in the world."
2150760,18101159,2014-08-21,19783616,Andreas,"We had a nice stay and everything is as described. We just missed a second chair to eat  what we have cooked at the nice kichenette.
Door was left open and key inside with instructions.
Very quite surrounding."
2150760,18254756,2014-08-24,18456005,Carrie,Michelle was exactly the host we were looking for this trip. while usually we love making a connection with people we were on a romantic getaway this time and wanted privacy. we stayed for 3 days and never once ran into our hosts. it was perfect. the house is ADORABLE. very clean and attractive. it was even more than what we had hoped for. 
2150760,18378017,2014-08-25,3137026,Heba & Jacob,We really enjoyed our quick stay at the cottage. It was really clean and welcoming and the bed was super comfy. Glad we discovered this spot and hope to stay there again sometime! Michelle was easy to communicate with and was there to help us in. Thanks!
2150760,18948609,2014-09-03,18844047,Megan,"We really enjoyed our stay at this little cottage. Quiet neighborhood, close to public transport, walkable to café and grocery, a slightly further stroll to a larger variety of restaurants and services. The park and lake so close. Everything really convenient. The cottage has all you'd need, was clean and cozy. Unobtrusive hosts - they left us the key and let us get on with our stay - it was perfect for our needs. Would stay here again happily. "
2150760,19239532,2014-09-08,14793612,Katie,Very thankful for Michelle's space during my last stay in Seattle. It was cozy yet roomy because of the thoughtful placement of furnishings. Convenient location close to restaurants and the great co-op was just down the block. Would absolutely stay here again.  Thanks Michelle!
2150760,19444061,2014-09-12,20736465,Dennis,"The cottage is nice, clean and private. all is as advertised. I did not have the opportunity to meet my host's, but I felt welcome and was quite comfortable.

The neighborhood appears overgrown, and the narrow streets offer little space for parking. Despite my initial concern, there was no problems and the neighborhood actually seems secure and friendly."
2150760,19619809,2014-09-15,20262729,Heather,"Michelle was in contact to let us know the place was ready and had a welcome note with instructions waiting for us when we arrived.   The place is clean, tasteful and exactly as described.  Perfect size for 2 guests with furnished kitchen and nice gas (website hidden) was there but we never turned it on - more fun to go to Seward park and close by restaurants/shops.  House is in a nice quiet residential area.  Nice mattress - got a great nights sleep."
2150760,20107903,2014-09-23,2774392,Peter,While Columbia City may be somewhat off the beaten track it is close enough to Seattle proper to not be a negative. You certainly get the flavor orf a residential neighborhood and the amenities of downtown Columbia City only a mile away.  
2150760,20937893,2014-10-07,70846,Peggy,We enjoyed our stay at this place. 
2150760,22634400,2014-11-10,23379958,Sophia,"Very much enjoyed my two quiet nights spent in this little guest cabin. It was so nice to wake up and be able to make myself breakfast in the cabin's kitchen area. The store and cafe down the street were perfect walking distance too, so easy to go get a little snack or coffee between outings in Seattle."
2150760,22715167,2014-11-12,9858380,Ursula,"ahhhh! My partner and I looooved staying in Michelle's Mother-In-Law.  It was excellent, and the surrounding yard was so beautiful.  We had quiet and privacy, but were also able to get in contact with Michelle when we needed.  Also it is in walking distance from excellent grocery store, coffee shop, restaurants and STEWARDS PARK! We'll be back! :)"
2150760,35390750,2015-06-18,6722743,Karsten,Great little house!  A welcome change from the Seattle hotel scene.  Also very close to Lake Washington and PCC for groceries.
2150760,36071623,2015-06-24,16449790,Chalane,Michelle was able to book us for a last minute stay - she replied within the hour and had everything ready right away. This place offers a cute little get away separate from perhaps expensive places downtown but still just a quick 15 minute drive downtown or to Capitol Hill. There are a few restaurants and such close by but we didn't end up exploring any. The Wifi didn't initially work when we got there but Michelle was able to resolve things after a few hours. No AC or TV but still a good buy for the price. We never even saw the hosts so we felt like we had our own space but could easily reach them. 
2150760,36186952,2015-06-26,5993386,Melissa,We had a lovely time at Michele's MIL. Beautiful decor and serene backyard make it a restful and relaxing getaway while still being close enough to sightseeing in Seattle. 
2150760,40224951,2015-07-29,20428685,Chris,"The cottage was cozy, comfortable, and clean. For us, the location was ideal. Close to Seward Park (great for kids and adults!) as well as shopping and restaurants along Rainier. The Wednesday farmers market in was a short walk away and so was the light rail to downtown. Michelle and Derek were great hosts and we would be very happy to stay here again. "
2150760,40534273,2015-07-31,15587631,Heather,"Very cute, Clean, and sweet little place to stay.  Nice kitchenette and bathroom, well appointed.
We happen to be there during a VERY warm weather stint and the only thing I could even remotely ding the place for was that there is no AC.  But there was a lovely ceiling fan and lots of windows that open to enjoy the breeze.
Thank you for allowing us to stay at your lovely little cottage."
2150760,41000549,2015-08-03,17367648,Melissa,"This cottage was perfect for my weekend adventure. Easy walking distance to gorgeous Seward park where I stumbled onto the air show. Also easy walk to main strip with great coffee and dinner options. The cottage itself is just as described. The bed was super comfortable and the ceiling fan and open windows helped keep it cool at night even when the days were high 90s. Michelle was very gracious - even working with me for a late arrival - and her recommendations in the guestbook were great. Also, for those traveling without cars, there were car2go vehicles always available when I wanted wheels. Highly recommend! "
2150760,41592473,2015-08-08,15966761,Jim,"We enjoyed our time at Michelle's place.  It's basically a studio apartment, well furnished with a very useful stove and refrigerator.  It's located in a residential neighborhood with lots of parking and close to shops and restaurants in Seattle's Columbia City area.  Michelle was a fine host, responsive to our needs.   When the wi-fi went down one night, it was back up within an hour of my telling her.  That more than me our expectations."
2150760,43857095,2015-08-22,28476458,Lesly,The listing was exactly as described.  Everything was easy and communication was timely.  The efficiency was clean and comfortable.  I would definitely stay again. 
2150760,44196512,2015-08-24,40658686,Rosemary,"Michelle was very kind to text me and check on my ETA the day of my arrival. She was home to greet me before leaving for the evening, and left the keys for me in the house. The house is quaint and cozy, and had everything I needed for my two night stay. Chelsea, her dog, was very friendly and sat outside the door during the day while I was there. The neighborhood doesn't LOOK safe (compared to Houston!) but everyone I met during my walks to and from Genesee/Seward parks was very friendly. My only complaints: I felt itchy sleeping there my first night (perhaps because I kept the window open since I slept fine the next night with it closed) and there were a few spiders in the shower and on the fan- minor issues that can't always be helped! Overall, I had a great experience with Michelle and her family. Thanks again!"
2150760,44730868,2015-08-28,165134,Ricky,"Very nice, private, clean  and quiet space that was as described. Michelle even had fresh local coffee ground, some tea bags with 1/2 & 1/2 use. 
"
2150760,46310239,2015-09-09,17088589,Nick,"Really lovely cottage. Very cosy and warm and bed is super comfy. Kitchen is functional but lacking some utensils if you want to cook a full meal. Wifi worked but dropped out frequently.
Nice neighbourhood with great walks by the lake or to cafes on Rainier Avenue.
Train station is 20-25 minutes walk, again a nice walk but difficult with luggage as hilly.
Definitely recommend as very much enjoyed our stay."
2150760,47737339,2015-09-21,33141052,Christina,"The room and the neighborhood were precisely as described. Places in Seattle are not always easy to get to, but Michelle's place truly is. We were able to get where we needed to go over the weekend with ease. And the sleep there was excellent! better than at home in my own bed."
2150760,48434648,2015-09-26,1499027,James,"At this point I have rented almost everywhere possible in this neighborhood and this place was one of the best. Great location, great/comfortable space, awesome host family and the outdoor space in the back is beautiful. Very relaxing and tranquil unit for anyone looking to stay in Seattle's best neighborhood! Would love to stay again."
2150760,48748002,2015-09-28,5872371,Sharon,"The place was easy to find, close to the city, and easy to check into.  The family gave us our space but were welcoming (cute kiddo and dog!) The amenities were basic- very little kitchen supplies available, so we ended up eating out instead of cooking at home which we prefer. The vegetation was a bit overgrown and we were dodging big spiders hanging all around the property, but inside was cozy, clean, and comfortable.  "
3479241,16744369,2014-08-01,18187898,Quentin,Great response in preparation.  Accommodated my early arrival  and got me orientated. Room was clean and functional.  Erika was a kind host and offered some welcome local visiting tips.  Apartment is conveniently located for bus routes and view is as advertised.
3479241,16855289,2014-08-03,14765271,Adam,"Great place to stay. Erica was kind and made sure everything was ok and gave suggestions for what to do. Kaila would be proud. 

It was very easy to get keys and it was easy to access. 

Good washing facilities downstairs if you are travelling like myself. 

 The view is amazing from the balcony. Perfect being by the lake for a walk or run and near enough to Fremont for drinks and food. 

Provided with own bathroom. Both that and room spotlessly clean. 

This place is a 10 min cab ride from downtown - use uber, it can be 8 bucks with 25 per cent discount this summer. 

Seattle is a great city with lots to do. I ended up staying 4 more days after my first 2!"
3479241,17521172,2014-08-13,18118626,Alex & Sarah,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Our host was sweet & wonderful. The apartment is just above our families home, so the location was great. The view is amazing. Close to downtown. Quiet street. All Around Awesome! We'd stay again, if available. Thank You! "
3479241,18019539,2014-08-20,18873670,Zachary,Erika and Kailia were a great hosts. My stay there definitely exceeded my expectations. And the view is that amazing. :)
3479241,18331459,2014-08-25,15030370,Jeremy,"This was the perfect place to stay during our 4 day mini-vacation to one of my favorite places in the world!  Unfortunately we weren't lucky enough to meet Kalia, as she was on vacation as well, but from the beginning she was quick and friendly in her responses to my messages.  We did meet her roommate, Erika, though and she was very friendly and accommodating.  During our trip we actually didn't spend much time in their apartment, because we had lots going on during our time in Seattle, but we couldn't have picked a better place to call ""home"" for the weekend.  The location was great, practically right on Lake Union, and the ""AMAZING view!"" listed in their posting's title is an understatement!!!  We had a full view of Lake Union, Gas Works Park and the surrounding scenery.  It was absolutely breath-taking.  I used to live in Seattle and I miss it everyday.  This was my girlfriend's first visit to the Emerald City, but she fell in love with the city just like I did so many years ago, so I know that we will be back as soon and as often as possible.  I don't know if Kalia and Erika will keep their apartment listed with airbnb, but if they do, we would love to stay with them again!      "
3479241,30061686,2015-04-16,30861883,Ron,The reservation was canceled 76 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3479241,34587533,2015-06-09,2995016,Allen,"Kalia and Erika's apartment was comfortable with great views, I especially enjoyed the proximity to Fremont and Queen Anne. The apartment was a short bike ride to downtown Seattle which I found to be very cycle friendly. Kalia accommodated my late arrival and let me keep my bike indoors. I had a wonderful 3 days at this place and hope to stay there again soon."
3479241,34892445,2015-06-13,32705435,Andrea,"Kalia was a great host! Her and her roommate were both gone, so I unfortunately didn't get to meet either in person. However, she responded to all my messages very quickly and even called maintenance for me while she was on vacation! She also leaves a welcome note with tips of what to see/eat, which was a really nice touch for someone completely new to Seattle :)

The apartment was spotless, the bed was honestly the most comfortable one I've ever slept on, and there are no words for how amazing the balcony view was. I don't consider myself a cat person, but Gypsy was so cute and made for a great temporary roomie. I miss it all already!"
3479241,38406355,2015-07-15,35326729,Stef,"Kalia's apartment is well sized, nice and clean with a amazing view on Lake Union. Upon my arrival, Kalia was very kind to help settle down, letting me know the few tips of the place and even offered me so detergent for me to make a quick laundry. I wish I had more time to spend with her instead of working... In any case, she and her house-mate are lovely. I highly recommend this place!

Note: they have an adorable cat who makes the cutest poses I ever seen."
3479241,40132939,2015-07-28,37317819,Goh,"Being first-timers to Airbnb, my husband and I were not sure what to expect. However, we were put at ease right from the start, when we arrived almost midnight at Kalia's apartment, and she welcomed us to a warm and cosy home. Throughout our stay, both Kalia and Erica were very helpful, friendly and sweet. They made sure we had whatever we needed for a comfortable stay. 

We also had fun playing with their cuddly cat. The view of Lake Union from the balcony was truly breathtaking, especially at night with the lights from the many boats and yachts lining the shore. 

This is a very well located abode if you want to stay at Lake Union, as it is easily accessible by bus, and just minutes to the shore. The neighbourhood is quiet and laid-back. There is a good breakfast place about 5 minutes' walk from the apartment.

Overall, it has been a very pleasant stay with very lovely people. Thanks, Kalia and Erica, for an experience that we will remember for a long time!
"
3479241,40534323,2015-07-31,13803711,Sven,I loved my stay at Kalias and Erica's place! They have a very nice view and a comfortable bed! It's pretty close to the city center by bus or car! The apartement is clean and tidy and the hosts are very nice and helpful! I totally recommend! :)
3479241,40873028,2015-08-02,2999267,Andre,Kalia was nice enough to host me on very little notice when my other host no-showed for my booking. Her place was great and she was a great host!
3479241,41508384,2015-08-07,33482893,Loc,"We had a great time, my son enjoy the place in which he had a good time to play game with Erika who is so sweet and a lovely cat. The fist night we arriving my son get hungry but I am afraid to eat out and Kalia share with us her own foods to cook for dinner, thanks so much Kalia. The location is perfect, we can get bus to downtown easy with few minutes walk to the station, the most impressed me is the infront lake Union view and our frienfly host."
3479241,41963949,2015-08-10,34546664,Gray,"Kalia is very friendly and easy-going. She prepared everything well. The room was clean. And I got my private restroom! I really like the house location , just besides the river. Very beautiful view. "
3479241,42360169,2015-08-12,22026804,Yvonne,"Super legit spot, patio is the focal because it  overlooks the water and you can feel the briskness  slap your face happy.  Clean shower, however room borders the apartment corridor so natural light is limited to how much of an exhibitionist you don't mind being. Location was amazing value, I effectively sight-jogged my way to some rad areas around Queen Anne and Fremont, and Uber and Lyft rides to Capital Hill were totally affordable. Kalia has good energy and is super chill but maybe I'm slightly biased because we're both from NorCal :)"
3479241,43112170,2015-08-17,100143,Deborah,"The apartment was lovely.  There was a power outage, and Kalia was on-the spot with candles.  The view from the balcony was indeed amazing, and I enjoyed some time relaxing there with Gypsy the cat in the next chair.  The access and check-out were easy.  The location was excellent with easy driving to both city center and north suburbs.  Quite pleased.  Thanks!"
2762241,15045006,2014-07-01,9373202,Dan,Anne and Kelly's place was a great way for us to begin our relocation to Seattle. We needed a place that we could stay for a month while we were waiting for new house to become available. They were very accommodating to let us book their lovely apt for so long. We were the first Air BbB guests to stay with them so they wanted make sure we had the things we needed and were great about requests and suggestions. Having use of the garage to park and access the apt is a great feature that guest will enjoy. The amenities are lovely and we would recommend staying with Anne & Kelly to our friends. 
2762241,15425049,2014-07-08,13077155,Susan,"We enjoyed staying at Anne and Kelly's beautiful, private apartment. The garage parking was great - it would have been difficult to find a parking space on the street. The apartment is furnished with quality pieces and has modern kitchen appliances: (induction stovetop and a combination microwave/convection oven). It was so nice to stay in a well constructed, aesthetically pleasing home away from home. 

Anne and Kelly are great hosts - pleasant, thoughtful, and helpful. We would be delighted to stay at their place again. "
2762241,16211272,2014-07-23,16047180,Marla,"- We had a very good first-time experience with this host.  The pictures/descriptions provided were accurate and appropriate. --- - Communication with the host was a little slow to get going at first, but I believe this was a website issue, not a host issue. 
- The location of this apartment is convenient with a nice neighborhood and surrounding area. Public transportation is close by and easy to navigate/cheap.
- The accommodations were very clean/organized - it is a basement apartment with only a window in the bedroom. Not a bad thing, just something of note. We were gone most of everyday, so it was not an issue for us. The host provided us with fresh milk and available coffee upon our arrival :)
- The host was very available via text during our stay and gave helpful tips on getting around and places to eat. 
- We did have a small miscommunication at one point regarding the number of guests in our party. However, it was resolved easily with a face-to-face chat with the owner who was very gracious. 
- We enjoyed our stay overall and everything went smoothly."
2762241,16561203,2014-07-29,16828603,Dan,"Was convenient to our son's apt.
Facilities felt very secure.
Easy walk to shops and coffee.
Convenient check in.
Living space was generous.
Nice kitchen area.
Clean bathroom and overall facilities.
Website statements accurate regarding facility not recommended for family gatherings. Best use for single or quiet couples. Sound does carry in the facility.
Can be a bit cooler, since the area is located in a lower level.
Paying attention to the rules is a must.
Must ask for supplies, but hosts are accommodating.

2762241,17566466,2014-08-14,17252573,Ralph,The accommodations exceeded our expectations! My wife and I are senior citizens visiting friends in the area and stayed in the apartment for four nights. It was quiet and quite a relaxing retreat after busy days of sightseeing. In the neighborhood we found a nice choice of restaurants within a short walk up the 59th Street hill on Phinney. We definitely will stay there again.
2762241,18066926,2014-08-21,12937084,Mary,"Anne and Kelly were gracious hosts and checked with us about anything we might need.  Furnishings were exactly as shown and very nice quality.  It was great space, nicely equipped, with all the comforts of home.   We got to park in the garage, which was a nice feature since on-street parking in Seattle can sometimes be a challenge.  They were also flexible about check in and check out, which was helpful.  The Phinney Ridge neighborhood is very nice, and we enjoyed sunny days and a beautiful view from the yard.   The shops and restaurants on the ridge itself are worth the hike up the hill, but Ballard is also walkable.  Our son and his family live in the area and we will definitely look to stay again when we come to visit."
2762241,18633787,2014-08-29,20237279,Andy,"The house was just as beautiful as pictured, and had great communication via text message on how to enter (receiving security codes).  Both Kelly and Anne were very friendly, warm, and relaxed individuals.  They really let me feel at home around them, and in the space they'd provided.  The space was very clean, well decorated, and comfortable."
2762241,18988287,2014-09-04,18028453,Stacey,"Staying in this apartment worked out perfectly for me. It was comfortable, private, and convenient. Anne and Kelly checked in with me daily via text/email to make sure I had what I needed. I would absolutely stay here again."
2762241,19247862,2014-09-08,17449027,MaryLee,"This was my first airbnb experience. It was a bit of a challenge to get everything set up, but finally it all worked out. The hosts sent me several emails to help me through the process of signing up, verifying, etc. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. They even left some fresh milk for coffee. Anne and Kelly answered my questions about where to find a grocery and laundrymat. 
My only complaint has to do with airbnb and not the hosts. The room was listed at $90/day and I was charged $100/day. Maybe I overlooked something. All in all it was a very good first experience and I will do the airbnb in the future. If you have to make a change in your reservation, as I did, I don't think it can be done through the mobile app, but you have to log into the regular website.
The neighborhood seemed good, and the picture was helpful for finding the place. The apartment is only two miles from the University District. If you need to be in north Seattle, this is the place for you. Kitchen was very useful, and had everything we needed. Thanks again to Anne and Kelly"
2762241,20091831,2014-09-23,17053448,Becky,This was  our first experience with AirBNB and we had a wonderful experience.  We never met Anne & Kelly but were in touch with them via text and email for anything we needed.  Their basement apartment is very clean and has everything you will need for a comfortable stay.   You do hear noise from upstairs - but it is not overly loud or annoying.  The driveway could be a bit difficult if you have a larger car because cars park up and down the street and make the turn into the driveway tight - but we had a compact car and had no issues.  The description of the space is very accurate and we were very happy with our accommodations.
2762241,20375161,2014-09-28,7184239,Brooke,"Great location - met all our needs! The property was exactly as described. Anne and Kelly were very easy to coordinate with and made our stay great. The location was perfect, a short trip to Fremont, Ballard or Greenlake. We would stay there again!"
2762241,21464422,2014-10-18,20407631,Andrew,"Amazing location!  Close to plenty of great restaurants,  Ballard,  Greenlake,  and Freemont.  Located in a quiet neighborhood.  Fully equipped with TV,  Kitchen,  bathroom with shower and comfortable bed,  all modern and updated.  Host was easy to communicate with and very friendly.  I would definitely stay again.  Thank you!!"
2762241,23071467,2014-11-22,23111778,Bas,"II had a very good stay in the apartment of Anne and Kelly. All was as described in the add. It's clean, cosy a tidy. I spend a few weeks in Seattle and felt really at home. So much better then living in a hotel. I needed to travel to Redmond every day, not super handy from a traffic point of view, but also not too bad if I was leaving on time. 
Leaving Seattle I missed my flight due to circumstances, Kelly and Anne were kind enough to let me stay an extra night.  Kelly and Anne, thanks for the hospitality!
"
2762241,32883938,2015-05-23,27361576,Howard,"Anne was an incredible hostess. The property is exactly as listed. As a ""clean freak"" (thanks to mom); it exceeded my expectations. The location is centrally located with respect to downtown commutes and proximity to anything you may need. Everything is close enough that your drive is really short or within walking distance. In the mornings, express buses get you downtown in about 20 minutes, non-express routes are approximately 30 minutes. The hosts are very responsive to any need and often would check to make sure all was well. Very nice people that I would have a coffee, beer or wine with any day. My stay was a long term one associated with job relocation. I dropped the ball and did not extend it in time and it was booked by another traveler (bummer). I would have happily stayed another week. This is an excellent option for short city trips or long term job relocation assignments. The unit features a kitchenette with a high end microwave/convection combo oven, a very fast induction burner (boils water really fast), and a mini fridge, the fridge does not have a freezer section.  I only share this as it disallows you from buying items that require they remain frozen until ready to use. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. I plan on sharing the information with my company as an alternative for those relocating to Seattle as it is much better than the options they provided. This was my first airbnb experience. Having the bar so high on an initial experience makes you nervous about the next one, I guess that's a good problem to have. You can book here with confidence. My experience exceeded my expectation. "
2762241,34151137,2015-06-05,12702974,Dave,"I felt very welcome in this amazing space. The description is very accurate. The neighborhood is really good with lots to do in all directions. The bed is comfortable, the amenities are amazing with a little kitchen in the space, and the bathroom is very nice. Private garage entrance is nice also. I enjoyed hanging out and working in the living room  & then having the bedroom down the hall gives a nice feeling of a great spacious area to stay."
2762241,34485541,2015-06-08,5829132,Emily,"I couldn't have asked for a better first Airbnb experience!  I was visiting family, who lived nearby, which made the location ideally perfect.  The neighborhood is simply stunning!  Upon my arrival, a dry erase board with the message 'Welcome Emily' made me feel completely at ease and excited for my stay.  The apartment was extremely spacious, clean, tastefully decorated, and private.  Sound does carry but it's not overwhelming.
My hosts checked in with me after my first night to make sure everything was good and if I needed anything, which was comforting.  
With the exception of having to walk up a very steep hill, all in all, my stay was super easy and met my needs entirely. "
2762241,34969762,2015-06-14,32233113,Susie,We felt very welcomed and at home.  The place was exactly as had been described.  Unfortunately we were too busy to meet our hosts but appreciated being able to connect with texts. Everything was very clean and up to date. It was a super convenient location for the  Fremont/Ballard/Queen Anne area. We loved being able to stay in a home environment with the ability to fix our own meals. We also appreciated having a spacious area with a livingroom/kitchen and a separate bedroom & bathroom.
2762241,35804669,2015-06-22,18286807,Molly,"Anne & Kelly's place was very nice- and fit the description they provided quite accurately! The apartment was very clean and well decorated. The only downfalls were that the only entrance to the apartment was through the garage, and because it was on the basement level, there were few window and little natural light. Another thing (which others may or may not mind)- we never got to meet Kelly & Anne and wish they would have come down and introduced themselves! "
2762241,36423021,2015-06-28,327124,Maria,They left s very nice note on s board to welcome us. Beautiful clean and gorgeous apartment in a wonderful neighborhood close to the vibrant Ballard district but yet quiet and residential with good parking. Vaulting mountain views from the hill! Trees galore!
2762241,37478626,2015-07-07,18097323,Stephanie,"Upon arrival, we had a warm message on a dry-erase board welcoming us. Walking in, it was everything that was expected and felt very cozy. The rooms were clean as was the bathroom and the entrance felt very private. The plug-in convection burner boiled water in a couple minutes and was very useful. Directions to use the TV/DVD/sound system were clear and it was a nice part of the stay. We had a little trouble with wifi in the living room, but it worked well in the bedroom. Though we were super grateful for the air conditioning (it was VERY hot outside during out stay), it did get a bit chilly at times, but more clothes = more comfort. We didn't meet Anne & Kelly, they definitely checked in enough times to make me feel that they were happy to help if needed."
2762241,39640635,2015-07-25,35021925,Joshua,"The apartment is just like it's described online. It is new and very clean. There is a nice living area with kitchenette and big screen TV. Down the hall there is a bath and bedroom. Private access is to be had via the garage with a key code. We never saw Anne or Kelley, but they were in contact via text/email upon our arrival. In my opinion the best thing about this property is the great location - walking distance to the zoo, restaurants and boutique shopping. About 20 minutes drive to downtown. The only slight negative I found was the weak WIFI signal, and I only cared because I had to work online. I would recommend it to a friend!"
2762241,41752121,2015-08-09,15279288,Matthew,"My girlfriend and I needed a cozy place to stay for the week while we attended the International. Anne and Kelly were both gracious hosts who provided us with a spacious place to sleep and hang out. They were always available to answer questions. There was an ample supply of coffee and tea available to us and we made use of the television options they provided. The location is very close to lots of great markets and Queen Anne where there is lots of touristy things to do like the Space Needle.  As this was our first time using Airbnb, we weren't sure exactly what the experience would be like, however we found it to be as cozy and enjoyable as home and we would gladly choose to stay here again. "
2762241,42637351,2015-08-14,11389135,Mark,"This quaint little residence is great: it's in an excellent spot that's easy to get to and is close (but not too close!) to the downtown area. The neighborhood may be a bit hilly, but that's easily forgotten when you're  greeted by the smell of conifers in the morning—one of my favorite things about staying in Anne and Kelly's place. While my odd hours prevented me from actually meeting them face to face, their quick communication, cute little chalk board and well-kept place felt warm and inviting—a great thing to come ""home"" to at the end of a long work day."
2762241,43185210,2015-08-17,38044238,Kelly,"Never got to meet Anne and Kelly but they were great hosts. Place was extremely clean and beautiful, loads of amenities."
2762241,45424725,2015-09-02,41967038,Mary,"Our stay at Anne & Kelly's place was our first Airbnb experience. I think we are converts. Their place is conveniently located and close to public transportation in a great neighborhood (Phinney Ridge) close to Green Lake. Bus #5 (which takes you to downtown attractions) can be caught at the top of a steep hill, a 10 minute walk 2 blocks away. Our hosts left us instructions/the code to access the garage door and another code for the private access to the whole lower floor of their home. Guests have their own private living room/kitchen, bathroom and of course, bedroom. The whole place was clean and comfortable. We didn't meet/see our hosts or their children. Communication was through texts, emails, and by phone. We thought this place was a really good deal and exceeded our expectations. "
2762241,46182640,2015-09-08,41496126,Blair,"Anne and Kelly's place was really comfortable and they made us feel completely taken care of. The apartment is almost exactly as it is described and very homey, clean and upscale. I definitely will stay there again if I'm ever in the Seattle area."
2762241,46982773,2015-09-14,12432466,Liz,"Anne and Kelly's basement apartment is very spacious, clean and a great value. We spent most of our time out with family over a long weekend but this would be a great place to stay for longer. The description is very honest so realize staying here requires parking and walking on steep hills. The entry is through their garage which made me worry about disturbing their family but they were adamant that it did not which made me feel better. I was pleased with my experience."
2762241,48929083,2015-09-29,43860751,Phyllils,"This was a really comfortable , clean,  spacious and nice place to stay.
The bedroom is  not super large but   adequate with a large closet. The  pillows, the mattress, the quilt - all very clean , fresh , warm and comfortable. 
The great room is large , with comfortable  and functional sofa, easy chair  and a large screen TV.  There is also a table and 4 chairs.
The  bathroom is a good size too. They even supply  a hair dryer. 
Everything is new and modern.
 The decor is wonderful in all the rooms .
Hosts are extremely thoughtful in providing a heater and  rain jackets  as well as  coffee and tea in the fully equipped kitchen.

There is a lack of natural light in the apartment.  Parking is not always easy to find very close by so you have to be comfortable walking  up /down a  steep hill.

The hosts are immediately responsive to texts and aim to please.
I recommend staying here.

2762241,49546628,2015-10-04,44384756,Nathan,"Easy access, great amenities, excellent location and very comfortable accommodations, perfect home base for exploring the area and a short drive to downtown. Very pleased with everything. Anne and Kelly were perfect hosts. Absolutely wonderful little apartment."
2762241,56253576,2015-12-11,48153127,Jessa,"Anne and Keply were great hosts and this place exceeded our expectations. We moved to Seattle a few weeks ago and had just been crashing with friends. To walk into a full separate apartment let us feel like we could finally settle in. Separate access for hosts and renters and keypad entrance made us really love being here. They even let us store some of our overflow moving boxes and things in the garage. The views are also spectacular! Seeing the Olympic mountains every morning was an added bonus! Great transit right to the heart of Seattle as well.

I cannot say enough about this space and the hosts. So glad we decided to get this place! Thank you Anne and jelly for sharing your home with us!"
8193516,46092508,2015-09-07,19286267,Connor,"We were Colt's first guests! We booked super last minute and he was very helpful sending maps and directions, giving us recommendations on places to eat, making coffee in the morning, etc. The place itself is nothing fancy as Colt says in the description, but it's clean, the bed was comfortable, the rate was reasonable, and it's in the best location."
8193516,46993012,2015-09-14,43607145,Amy,"Colt was a wonderful host, and extremely accommodating. He was willing to let us into the apartment early to drop off our things, he gave us some great tips for this to see and do in the area, and he really helped us feel at home on Capitol Hill. His apartment wad beautiful and very conveniently located, too! Tons of bars and restaurants and a short walk to proper downtown Seattle."
8193516,48773108,2015-09-28,43690802,Natalia,"Colt was an amazing host. He was really friendly and helpful. We didn't spend much time at the apartment, but the place was great. The building was quiet, the apartment was clean and the location was absolutely perfect. There are so many great restaurants and bars nearby, it's great just be able to walk around and explore Capitol Hill. It's also very close to downtown and super easy to get to from the airport, less than a 15 min walk from the Light Rail downtown. For the awesome rate and perfect location, we couldn't ask for more. We would definitely return! "
8193516,49564218,2015-10-04,14926022,Julian,The location was excellent & the guys were realty helpful & friendly.
8193516,49818021,2015-10-06,12355885,Tyler,"Great location, and the listing was very accurate. Colt was nice and welcoming, the apartment was very clean. Highly recommended :)"
8193516,50505844,2015-10-12,28869634,Kris,"Colt and Holly were very welcoming and accommodating, they made coffee for us every morning! He was very helpful and even after a snafu with getting the keys and more than made up for it. The room itself is private and very quiet despite being in a rather lively neighborhood with some great late night hang outs on either end of the block. It's a right next to several bus lines that take you into downtown Seattle in less than ten minutes. We had a great time in the city made even better by this lovely little cap hill launch pad :)"
8193516,51354128,2015-10-19,16444406,Arnd,Our two night stay was a good experience. We felt welcome and Colt gave us some tips about things to do and see in Seattle. REally great location in walking distance from Downtown and all the nightlife of Capitol Hill.
8193516,52288073,2015-10-27,15449218,Johan,"Communication with Colt was quick, to the point and effective. He and the room where ready for me, Handing off the keys and the protocol where explained thoroughly. The room was exactly as per offering and pictures, quiet and room enough to move about. Located at walking distance to many restaurants, the big Starbucks Reserve and water front, light rail station and there is a great bike shop at the corner where you can check/rent bikes.
Colt and Holly were great hosts and I will definitely return to them when I visit Seattle again."
8193516,54175554,2015-11-16,47978514,Celia,"Colt was very friendly and responsive to messaging which was much appreciated. We saw Colt and his roommate very little. We felt we had a good amount of privacy and the apartment was nice and quiet despite being in a busy area.The location was perfect for walking around capital hill and downtown; the location was our favorite aspect of the place. The apartment is as listed in the pictures. Rates were great in comparison to hotels. 

It's hard for me to be critical because the hosts were very friendly, but I appreciate honest reviews when I'm looking for a place. We were a bit disappointed with the cleanliness: the tub/shower is cramped (clawfoot as indicated) and definitely needed a good scrub. The bedroom and bathroom was very dusty. Trash was full (2 bags) in the bedroom. There was no place for toiletries in the cramped tub or space for luggage/clothing in the room. This was a room and had no B&B feel to it at all. 

Overall this felt like a cheap room to crash in; it felt like we were staying in a room someone just stepped out of without preparation for guests. Again location was great as was the host but in the future we would rather pay a little more and rent a hotel or place that felt prepped for guests. "
1614502,13941099,2014-06-08,111996,James,"Stay with Kate if you can. She is a fabulous host, her home is clean and comfortable, the room and bathroom are perfect (there's a balcony!), and the sheets are super soft. Kate's breakfast offerings are also amazing. She wonderfully catered to my vegan diet and made me feel at home.

Kate's home is a short walk from Chuck's Hop Shop (1000+ beers) where there is almost always a local food truck parked dishing out good food. Note to vegans: check Chuck's website for the food truck schedule and try and visit Kate when the Plum truck is parked there - Yum! The local coffee shops are also great (I believe Tougo serves Mighty-O donuts). The food, drink, shops, etc. a short walk away (12th) are great too.

Kate's artistic home is a GREAT value. I highly recommend staying with her if you can."
1614502,14253019,2014-06-15,16401791,Shameet,"Kate was an unbelievable host. From our initial contact, she went above and beyond...asking me about my dietary restrictions and having a breakfast with a variety of teas and other nutritious foods every morning. Her home and room appeared as advertised. This is what I call Northwest hospitality!"
1614502,14878622,2014-06-28,16592734,Marissa,"Kate is an amazing host! She was so kind and helped us with tips on what to do and how to get around. Her house is beautiful and well kept, I would fully recommend her. The location is also a quick walk to Capitol Hill with tons of great restaurants!"
1614502,15200136,2014-07-04,17348419,Lee Ann,"I enjoyed my stay with Kate. When making my reservation and asking questions, she always responded quickly.  My room was very comfortable and decorated nicely. I loved the little balcony, and the bed and sheets felt wonderful. Breakfast was a nice bonus, and I appreciated a place to park. I loved walking around the neighborhood, looking at the variety of houses. I would be happy to stay at Kate's again."
1614502,15769377,2014-07-15,8466667,Dimitri,"Kate's place was gorgeous. It is ideally located for my trip purposes, there was a reserved space in the back of the house for my rental car. I could enter her home from two different sides which facilitated my in/out privileges. The private bathroom is well located next the bedroom. I had an excellent time there and she was very accommodating of late minute change of plan."
1614502,15937645,2014-07-18,6788669,Colum,"Kate was such a wonderful host. She was very accommodating and conversational. The house is beautiful (built in 1904) and the room is a great getaway, with little balcony and generous bathroom.
The neighborhood is old and everyone is very friendly, saying hello from their front porch as you pass by. It's close to a lot of nice shops, restaurants, etc."
1614502,16102483,2014-07-22,5885871,Natalie,"Kate is a wonderful host and her home is very cozy and comfortable. 
We loved the beer shop just a short walk down the street called Chuck's Hop Shop where you can also pick up food from a rotating list of food trucks. We ventured by foot and bus easily to Fremont, Capital Hill, the piers, and downtown. We would definitely stay at Kate's again! Thanks Kate!"
1614502,16330406,2014-07-25,15648304,Anna,"Our short stay with Kate was delightful. We were looking for a simple room in a good location, but were pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort (great bed!!) and the kind, laid-back host. All-in-all a great experience."
1614502,16480771,2014-07-28,17125397,Connor,"Kate was a wonderful, thoughtful host. Her home's lovely (the art!), and in walking distance of some really cool places. And her cat is the sweetest!"
1614502,16674413,2014-07-31,1991302,Geo,"Kate is an excellent host for us. She is easy to interact with and friendly to offer good tips and suggestions to make our stay comfortable. Her place is exactly as her description on the Airbnb website. Above all else, she provided a large variety of goodies for breakfast!

We had a good time in Seattle thanks to the good decision to stay at Kate's house."
1614502,16738045,2014-08-01,2921341,Sam,Kate's lovely house is in a great location.  The bedroom and bathroom are in a very private part of the house. The bed is very comfortable.  Her lovely art fills the walls.  Kate was great and made everything easy and convenient.  Recommended.  I would stay here again
1614502,16855413,2014-08-03,18063494,Jesse,"Kate - and Kate's beautiful home - were simply great. We were able to come and go as we pleased, and we had an awesome time hanging out with Kate when we were both there. Her home is wonderfully decorated, the room is private, access to our bathroom, etc. Looking forward to staying here again."
1614502,17213936,2014-08-09,5502103,Natasha,"Staying at Kate's place was a real delight. The moment you walk in you are surrounded by such imaginative beauty, and she is such a fun and delightful host. My husband and I have definitely made a new friend! From her house it is easy to walk anywhere on Capital Hill or downtown or certainly to take a bus wherever you like. The bedroom and bed were very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and such fun (with those gorgeous painted goldfish) and the kitchen was easy and lovely, as is everything Kate touches. It was great being able to park behind her house too. We highly recommend staying at Kate's and look forward to doing so again ourselves."
1614502,17445526,2014-08-12,15448864,Cathy,Kate was warm and welcoming. Location was good with local bus routes. Would loved to have stayed longer.
1614502,18015024,2014-08-20,18298039,Amanda,"Kate is an absolutely amazing hostess and made us feel so welcome from the moment we stepped in. She wasn't able to be there when we arrived, but she made it easy to come in and get settled. 

She was extremely respectful of our privacy, but more than willing to chat with us and give us advice, which we gladly took advantage of. Kate's no longer just a hostess to us, but a friend!

Her home itself was beautifully decorated, cozy, and welcoming. She provided a delicious breakfast everyday and made sure we had everything we needed. 

My husband and I highly recommend Kate for anyone looking to stay close to downtown Seattle, and yet far enough away that you're in a quiet neighborhood. "
1614502,18123943,2014-08-22,17708973,John,"When we arrived, Kate had prepared a welcome letter which described where everything was that we needed to know about.  Meeting and getting to know Kate was a pleasure.  We felt so comfortable, so at home.  She is very down-to-earth and gave us recommendations for things to do that matched our interests and energy level.  The house and room were lovely.  Thanks so much for making our stay in Seattle great!  "
1614502,18667240,2014-08-30,19003312,Tim,Very nice place. Room/home was clean and in a nice location in a residential area. Downtown Seattle and Capital Hill are easily walkable. Have breakfast was a nice plus. Kate stayed out of our hair and I would recommend staying here.
1614502,18800440,2014-09-01,6138226,Cary,"Staying at Kate's home was a seamless, enjoyable, convenient, and comfortable experience. I arrived from the airport with access to the room and clear instructions. In and out of town for a wedding, my interactions with Kate were lovely albeit brief. The accommodations were clean and relaxing and she seemed to have coffee made at the perfect times! 

Highly recommend.
"
1614502,19156857,2014-09-07,20416198,Veronica,"Kate was very welcoming and made the experience feel very homey. We loved having breakfast on the little terrace and I was glad to have her recommendations on where to go and what to see. The house is beautiful and while not downtown its walkable or accessible by a few buses. Kate was super kind when my boyfriend hobbled back from his run with a sprained ankle, gettng him ice and being genuinely helpful. All in all it made for a great trip to Seattle. "
1614502,19277266,2014-09-09,279062,Juli,"Kate helped with public transportation directions and made it easy to find her place. She is a wonderful host. The neighborhood feels homey, and it's quiet at night. The room & bath are adequate and clean. It was a pleasure to stay here!"

The house was clean and located in a quiet residential area with good buses connection. She offered great breakfast with variety choices everyday, i enjoyed having a cup of coffee before going out."
1614502,20201490,2014-09-25,9196049,Phyllis,"Wonderful combination of a charming house and a charming hostess.  Kate has filled her Craftsman style home with primary colors, museum size original paintings, and a fun laugh that makes sitting around her table and sharing experiences truly enjoyable.  Centrally located with convenient metro to downtown, we were able to leave our car off-street and not think about it for our time in the city.  We would certainly stay with her next time we're in Seattle, and have even invited her to call us should she ever visit our hometown, she's that nice.  Thanks, Kate, for a great time."
1614502,20567782,2014-10-01,20824556,Ashley,"Our trip to Seattle was wonderful!  Kate's home is located in a quiet residential neighborhood, within walking distance from downtown and several good restaurants and bars.  The parking space in the back was very convenient for our rental car.  Kate was incredibly helpful in providing us with directions to her home and coordinating our visit before we arrived.  The accommodations were clean and exactly what we needed for a busy, event-filled trip.  Breakfast and coffee in the morning were a great bonus!"
1614502,20988649,2014-10-09,18221731,Dianne,"Kate was a most gracious host. Staying in Kate's artistic home made me feel I was in my own home away from home. Breakfast offerings were fresh each morning  including hearty, home-made muffins and coffee ready  when I woke up.
Upon arrival, the room was made ready and the bed was very comfortable. The large closet space was handy since I was staying in Seattle for several days. The private bath had all the amenities for a traveler plus being very cozy and personal.
The neighborhood is a nice place to walk around which I did. I would highly recommend Kate as a host to other guests and would book with Kate again. Thanks Kate for being an attentive host!

"
1614502,22197940,2014-11-01,22108092,Margaret,"Staying with Kate, I actually felt like a member of the family. She respected my privacy but was around to engage in friendly conversation when I wanted it. She lives and works upstairs and I basically had the first floor to myself. She made coffee every morning provided muffins/cereal and juice plus a shelf in the refrig for me. There's also convenient parking in the back. The area is charming with eating, drinking and shopping options nearby. Kate's cat Todd is very mellow and friendly."
1614502,24681288,2015-01-01,17931629,Juno,"Great experience! The house is decorated like a gallery with art works, even more artistic than I expected. The host is very nice and considerable. "
1614502,25145377,2015-01-07,15825166,Brendan,"Kate was a fantastic host and we had a wonderful stay at her house.  The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet and we slept like logs for all four nights we were there.  Kate provided an array of options for breakfast, which was entirely unexpected but so appreciated, including freshly baked muffins and a new pot of coffee each morning.  She really made us feel like family.   The house is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Seattle and I highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting the area.  Five out of five stars.  Thank you Kate! "
1614502,25303336,2015-01-11,8012712,Michele,"Kate was a gracious and friendly host. Her home is comfortable and centrally located. The off street parking for my car was an added bonus, as parking on capital hill can sometimes be a pain.   Highly recommended.  "
1614502,25759959,2015-01-25,2066810,Danyel,"Kate is a warm and welcoming hostess. Her house is beautifully kept, with a lovely (and highly functional!) kitchen, and remarkable art throughout (including the bathroom, which is nearly worth a trip in itself). She was an easy-going hostess; it was good to chat when we intersected, and kept comfortably out of each others' ways the rest of the time. My thanks for her introducing me to ""Family Tree"" and sharing a delightful evening over it.

It's worth noting that while both the bathroom and the bedroom re private, the hallway connecting them opens into the common area; bring a bathrobe! "
1614502,27601589,2015-03-08,27908861,Sanchita,Staying with Kate felt like home. She was so hospitable and had such great recommendations. I got sick during my stay and spent a lot of time at her place and was very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was awesome too!!
1614502,28102668,2015-03-17,28256054,Jayanthi,"Kate was a wonderful, warm host. She was quick in responding to all our enquiries/ coordinating our check-in and was very kind in letting us pick up stuff that we left behind.

Her home is truly artistic and well-maintained. The bedroom and the bath were private and she had anticipated all our needs and well-stocked it.The parking in her drive way was comfortable and the location of the house is very convenient to visit downtown/ capitol hill area and all major attractions.

She went out of the way to provide us breakfast with an excellent selection - Cereal, fresh fruits, oat meal, bagels, baked goodies and coffee/tea/juice. We loved your scones. Thank you so much for your great hospitality."
1614502,28637052,2015-03-27,8473765,Rose,"Kate was such a lovely host and my entire experience staying at her house was wonderful and felt like home. To start, I was in a pickle and looking for a last minute booking. Kate replied within 30 minutes of me contacting her (the night before!). She was flexible with the arrival time and left me a key while she was away. The details like breakfast in the morning, a clean robe, new soaps, hair dryer, etc were a very thoughtful touch. The bed was comfortable and the house relaxing and quiet. I slept like a rock! I loved that Kate's location was walking distance to the Capital Hill strip so I could easily get groceries, dinner, or a drink. If you're looking for a private room with a lovely host in Capital Hill, this is your place. Thanks Kate! "
1614502,30627404,2015-04-25,30474415,Martin,"Kate was a wonderful host for our trip, we really felt like home.
Perfect location in Capitol Hill, near Downtown.
Just read all the nice former comments, we just fully agree :)

Thanks again for your great hospitality, Kate!"
1614502,30888401,2015-04-28,15430017,Robert,"Kate was a great host for our trip.  She was super accommodating with our morning arrival and assisting with recommendations for things to do and where we could eat.

The room was comfortable and the space in the house feels private.  The art work throughout the house was fun and nicely done.  

The neighborhood is a bit eclectic with some houses lovingly cared for and others requiring some serious TLC.  That said it felt very safe and we walked it at all times of day and night.  

The buses are within a block and a half from the front door and will take you all over town and environs.  Very centrally located with so much within walking distance.  We would recommend a stay here for your next stop in Seattle."
1614502,30997793,2015-04-30,30583659,Xi,非常热情好客、有着爱心的房东，在这里度过了两个舒适难忘的夜晚，家一般的感觉！当然，不要忘记主人是位艺术家，家里的布置别具一格，而且也帮助我解决了很多在西雅图旅途期间求助的问题！

During our three days in Seattle, we walked from Kate's to downtown then took the bus back home at night. Our room was cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable! The house is spacious and open and the bathroom was clean. Breakfast and coffee were great perks to kick-start our day. We were very happy that we decided to stay here and not in busy/loud/overpriced downtown!"
1614502,32628839,2015-05-19,21139177,Tatjana,We had a great stay at Kate's place. Kate is an experienced host and has thought through the details to make all her guests feel welcomed and comfortable at her place (many are mentioned in the other comments). It's a beautiful house with lots of space on the floor. Thanks so much for hosting us - we really enjoyed our stay!
1614502,32939363,2015-05-23,29597616,Albert,"Kate was an amazing host! Everything was clean and she was really helpful with any questions we had! She even makes breakfast and coffee every morning and responded quickly to any questions/requests we had. She also had a list of things to do/places to go that was really dope! Especially since it was our first time in Seattle. The place was basically walkable to everything and is a really nice neighborhood.  Next time, I will definitely try to book Kate's place again! Super chill! "
1614502,33847318,2015-06-01,33581512,Laura,"Kate was very welcoming and willing to recommend things to do in Seattle. The house was cute, clean, and in a quiet, residential neighborhood just a shirt bus ride from downtown. "

1614502,35388718,2015-06-18,32872448,Melanie,"Great place, nice distance to/from downtown. Decor is unique and whimsical, very clean with own bathroom. Wish I had had more time to explore the neighbourhood but was there for a conference with not much downtime. Nice to stay in stay in a home instead of the usual hotel."
1614502,35740753,2015-06-21,7728453,Katherine,"Kate was awesome! She had a great sense of the neighborhood, and left a list of recommendations in the room, as well. Her house is really cool -- ask for the art tour! Everything was well stocked, and she left out an amazing selection for breakfast every morning, and even made us croissants. Could not have been more welcoming. The cat was cool, too. Thanks, Kate!"

1614502,36431686,2015-06-28,6326313,Ye,"Kate is one of the best hosts and friendliest person I've ever met! Kate's house is so interesting, colorful and is decorated with artistic taste. The neighborhood is so fun, tons of cafes, restaurants. My mom and I walked everywhere! It's about 10mins walk to Capital Hill, 25 mins to downtown, and there are a few buses only one block away. 

I will be back! Thank you Kate!"

1614502,37452658,2015-07-07,28742624,Virgil,"We enjoyed staying at Kate's bed and breakfast.  The place was just as we expected based the pictures on airbnb.   Everything was clean and comfortable.  We felt that we had lots of privacy yet really enjoyed talking with Kate in the evenings.  She was a friendly, likeable person and we feel like we've made a new friend.  We'd be happy to stay with her again.  "
1614502,37811107,2015-07-10,10665629,Kristen,"Kate was an awesome host! Her lovely home is in a quiet neighborhood and the room is spacious and clean - same with the bathroom! My husband and I are familiar with the Seattle area, but even if you're not, it's very easy to travel downtown from Kate's home. Kate is a great host - she includes breakfast! (And a parking spot which is helpful in the city.) Would highly recommend Kate's place, and would definitely stay again. Thanks Kate!"
1614502,38417239,2015-07-15,36139857,Jeffrey,"Our stay with Kate was wonderful!  My wife and I found her home quiet, clean and comfortable, with great amenities, most notably the fresh-baked croissants and fresh brewed coffee in the morning (along with OJ, milk, granola, bagels, cantaloupe, etc.)!  We had great privacy when we wanted it, and great conversations with Kate when we wanted that!  The room was great to sleep in, even got to sleep late as the heavy curtains blocked out the light really well.  The location is great, accessible by bus or foot to great parts of Seattle, especially Capital Hill.  Also really appreciated the free parking!  All in all, highly recommended."
1614502,38726102,2015-07-18,32278264,Chris,"Kate's house was perfect for our trip to Seattle.  The guest room in her house is clean and comfortable, and the guest bathroom was nice as well.  It felt very private, and she made us feel very welcome in her home.  We didn't see her much, but we enjoyed talking to her when we did. 

Parking was very convenient and getting into and out of the house was easy.  It's walking distance to the capitol hill area where there are a lot of shops and restaurants, and probably even to city center if you're feeling more ambitious.  

"
1614502,39540651,2015-07-24,6021685,Megan,"Kate is an excellent host who executes the B and B experience with grace.

We felt at home right away! 
The neighborhood is safe and quiet.
We both highly recommend a stay with Kate (:"
1614502,40622237,2015-08-01,37095631,Cynthia,"Kate is a wonderful host. She really makes you feel like you are at home. Thoughtful and detailed in her correspondence (quick responses) and amenities (fruit, pastries, coffee/tea). When I arrived, my stomach wasn't feeling good so I asked for some honey to mix into hot water to settle my stomach. Kate not only provided some honey, she helped me prepare it! She is a kind and fun person to be around, and respects your privacy if you're feeling introverted. Her cat, Todd, is a sweetheart and doesn't make any noise except for some purring when you pet him. The room was clean and comfortable, and it was wonderful having a private bathroom that was also very clean. I'm a clean freak, so if I say it's clean, it's definitely clean! Kate has everything prepared for you. I never had to ask any questions, she anticipates everything you may possibly need. Located in the Central District, you're super close to several bus lines to downtown. It's also right next to the Capitol Hill district so you can walk to all the great restaurants around there. I would stay with Kate again in a heartbeat for my next trip to Seattle. I can't recommend her highly enough! Thanks, Kate, for the best stay and sleep I have ever had on my travels."
1614502,42878237,2015-08-16,37449870,Leslie,"Kate was extremely friendly and our stay was perfect! The whole house was very clean and organized, and our room was quite comfortable. Light breakfast in the morning was just what we needed to get the day started, and Todd the cat provided excellent company, as well. The location is within walking distance to numerous attractions in the city of Seattle, but is nestled in a quiet neighborhood away from heavy noise and traffic. Kate was an excellent host, and her home was colorful, inviting, and the perfect place to rest our heads after exploring the city!  "
1614502,43768455,2015-08-22,29905239,Annie,"Kate is really cooool and friendly, and is the one of the reasons that I love Seattle! The location is really centre-located, only take 15mins to go to space needle, and only 18mins to go to pike market! Kate also prepares a guidebook for interesting places to go and introduces a lot of places to eat! Kate is really helpful and friendly, she prepared coffee and breakfast for my mum and me, and is quite and helpful all the time! 
Also, he home is really artistic and will definitely bring you comfort as home! Highly recommended! "
1614502,44351666,2015-08-25,40905066,Suji,Kate's place and its location were perfect. My sister and I stayed for three nights and felt comfortable and welcomed the entire time we were there. We would definitely stay there again if we are ever in the area again in the future. Thanks Kate!
1614502,45125581,2015-08-31,1586819,Paula,Kate is a great host and her house is beautiful. Really helpful directions and genuine concern we had a good holiday. Good bedroom and bathroom and lovely to have room for a car and a balcony too. Important for guests not to mind smell of cat food.
1614502,45814717,2015-09-06,40257108,Kae,"Kate was warm and kind. Her charming house was exactly how appeared on the website. I especially liked her kitchen and her chandeliers. What a creative person she is! The large mugs of coffee and yummy croissants were exactly what we needed before long walks in Seattle downtown. Thanks, Kate!"
1614502,46409581,2015-09-10,11790928,Amy & Laura,"Kate and her place were wonderful! We loved our conversations with Kate, she was sweet enough to find us vegan, gluten-free breakfast foods! She really makes you feel at home, gives you plenty of privacy (you have your own bathroom right next to the bedroom), and opens up her place to you. The apartment is in a wonderful location, 20min walk downtown, 5min walk to a grocery co-op and a Trader Joe's, and right by several major bus routes. Even when her cat peed on the bathmat, she was very prompt in notifying us and cleaning it up.  The kitchen had all of our cooking needs, the cat food and litter are located there as well so it helps to not mind the smell of cats. Thanks for a lovely introduction to Seattle Kate!"
1614502,46637742,2015-09-12,42590550,Rachel,"Kate's home was wonderful, clean and centrally located.  I was able to walk to all Seattle has to offer.  Transport by uber/cab was easy as well if you are looking to get somewhere in a hurry.

Bathroom and bedroom very cozy & private, great for one or two guests. Kate was a gracious and accommodating host- breakfast and coffee in the morning was much appreciated. I spent the majority of my time out of the house but did get to relax and do some reading with the resident kitty cat in the shared living room area - which is gorgeous. I recommend Kate's place for exploring Seattle and funky Capitol Hill area!
"
1614502,48044915,2015-09-22,19989181,Gina,"It was my first time using Airbnb. Kate was great. I enjoyed meeting her and getting to know her and the area. When I woke up, she had tea, coffee, oatmeal, and fruit ready for me. I had to extend my stay as it took longer than expect to find a house in the area and she was accommodating.  Very considerate. Thank you Kate! "
1614502,48728243,2015-09-28,3160699,Misuk,"Stayed at Kate's home for travelling in Seattle was a good choice. She made me and my friend feel very comfortable in her home. And I was impressed by her artworks in her home and I liked them. In the morning, I jogged in the Wasington Park Arboretum and it was really amazing. 
"
1614502,49369210,2015-10-03,22151368,Nils,"We went as a couple to Seattle and it was a great stay at Kate's place. Everything is exactly as described, very clean and carefully decorated. Own bathroom, room and wardrobe and access whenever we wanted. Breakfast was provided and we really felt at home and confi.
Seattle Downtown is in 20 min and Pine Pike in 10 min walking distance and a nice bar place is just around the corner.
Chatting with Kate was also a delight since she is a very open person and gave some great advise for Seattle Newcomers.
All in all highly recommended!!"
1614502,49947985,2015-10-07,25274724,Fanny,"Gracious, laid back host whom we only get to cross path shortly, but fully enjoy her openness in sharing her home. Good privacy as we essentially have the ground floor mostly to ourselves while private quarters is upstairs.  There is a cat in the house, but it hangs out mostly upstairs.  Appreciate Kate's way in making her home photo-appealing yet warm and practical for guests. Great space for morning yoga and meditation.  Fresh baked croissant in the morning was a surprise.  Plenty of fruit on open kitchen table.  Thank you for having us!"
1614502,50562647,2015-10-12,44796570,Jade,"It was my first time using Airbnb. Kate and her place were excellent!!!!!! The whole house was very clean and organized, and our room was comfortable.  Kate is really helpful and friendly, she prepared  breakfast for us, all handmade bread, tasted wonderful!  And is quite and helpful all the time. Help us send the postcards as well, very considerate. Thanks for everything Kate. Would be happy to stay with her again. ^.^"
1614502,51177512,2015-10-18,45080302,Daniel D,Kate was a great hostess. Everything  was as stated. The house is within 20 minutes by bus of all the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle. Kate was kind enough to offer gluten free breakfast options for my wife. The house is lovely and we were glad to see we had our own bathroom. It was a pleasant experience which we highly recommend. Dan
1614502,51852917,2015-10-24,46496364,Dinelli,Our stay  with kate was wonderful. It was a quiet place.  We really enjoyed staying with her.

3510818,17065523,2014-08-06,3818847,Rob,Excellent home and host. It was a perfect stay in Seattle. Convenient location and quiet neighborhood. 
3510818,17460171,2014-08-12,4871621,Christa,"I loved this Airbnb!  The decor was great, the neighborhood was cute, and Shannon was spot on with her suggestions around the neighborhood.  If I really lived in Washington, I would love to live in a place like this Ballard house.  The neighborhood is quiet and great for people who want a relaxing stay.  I can't forget to mention that her King size bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! Also, make sure to walk over to The Fat Hen, Honore, and Delancy if you want some yummy places to eat at within walking distance! "
3510818,17872238,2014-08-18,4204689,Scott,Perfectly perfect. Will stay here again. 
3510818,19644114,2014-09-15,2315832,Abbie,"We had a wonderful time in Shannon's comfortable vintage home for a trip to Seattle for my father's 80th birthday. Shannon is a great communicator and quick responder. She allowed us to bring our own small microwave (not otherwise available)--and when we were dummies and tripped a circuit by running the microwave and the hot water kettle at the same time, she came right over to access the switch box (behind a locked door). We were lucky she was in town and staying nearby.

The house is *wonderful*, the location is fantastic, and Shannon is an extraordinarily thoughtful host. If you want a TV (we didn't!) there isn't one. But you'll have a marvelously comfortable bed in a quiet neighborhood, high-quality linens, a real home to stay in, complete with full-size closet in addition to a wardrobe and dresser, and a really wonderful back yard. It's so great to have a real kitchen as well, plus the dining room and living room. So cozy! Street parking is easy. You do have to be able to go up steps into the house (again, no problem for us). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
3510818,21465343,2014-10-18,20574209,Craig,"We had a great trip to Seattle to visit our family and Shannon's home was located in a convenient location, and nice neighborhood. No need for a car.
Shannon was a good host, offering to launder towels and bedding during our almost three week stay, although it wasn't necessary as she stocked ample towels and a change of sheets in the house.
She provided a very comfortable king size bed and a clean house for us. We appreciated the few supplies in the kitchen to hold us over until we could shop for groceries.
It is a cozy, clean, and quiet place to stay."
3510818,22442728,2014-11-06,10909068,Rita,"It was a pleasure to stay at Shannon's home, which was clean, very comfortable and so nicely decorated.  We would definitely want to return when we visit Seattle again."
3510818,22618758,2014-11-10,23127207,Cheryl,"We had a wonderful stay in this charming home.  Most importantly, the home and bed are very comfortable, clean, quiet, well equipped and perfectly located for our needs. The added benefits were it's charming decorative details that made us feel as though we had a home away from home. We loved our stay! "
3510818,24487568,2014-12-29,678768,Paul,"We had a great time staying in Shannon's home. The place was exactly as it appears in the pictures and the listing and she was an incredibly accommodating host before, during and even after our stay (helping return something that was erroneously delivered while we were there). Considering that our stay occurred during the holidays, it was even more impressive that she was so attentive. 

We were able to easily and affordably use Car2Go or UberX to everywhere that we couldn't walk to (which wasn't much). The water pressure in the shower was great (this is huge for me) and the bed was incredibly comfortable and I really can't stress this enough. We were literally taking pictures of the tags on the mattress and pillows so we could order them later ourself. There were ample clean linens for the 5 days that we stayed and the home has Nest heating so there is no issue trying to figure out how to turn on the heat. The backyard looked nice though it was really too cold for us to spend much time out there. 

Lastly, the home also has a cool style about it and doesn't feel like some stodgy rental property. "
3510818,25287107,2015-01-11,19808677,Mike,"Shannon's home is like a lovely little time capsule, and only a few blocks from some great restaurants/bakeries.  I had a great stay."
3510818,26592172,2015-02-16,10419779,Lindsay,"We had an unbelievable experience at Shannon's well styled and comfortable home. The location was just what we were looking for, close-in to the sites of Seattle, walkable to all of Ballard, and yet quiet and out of the way enough to relax. We highly recommend this for a romantic weekend away. There were plenty of amenities to provide more than you need, but the house is blissfully free of distraction. We'd come back for sure.  "
3510818,27433832,2015-03-04,26705931,Max,"Shannons place is both a little bit of a time travel as well as very much enjoyable. The house is decorated with love and Shannon was welcoming, friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is just great, quiet while at the same time close to smaller shops and easy t go to Seattle downtown.
Highly recommended!"
3510818,28730196,2015-03-29,8574337,Lauren,Lovely little home with every extra comfort included.  Shannon really goes the extra mile.  Huge comfortable bed made for relaxing. Home is only minutes from DT.  Beautiful large backyard as well.
3510818,33154052,2015-05-25,32868161,Dana,"Super cozy home, very friendly hostess, and a wonderful location…really couldn't have asked for more.  Also thoroughly enjoyed the fabulous record collection and lounging in the palatial backyard!  Shannon was an incredibly thoughtful hostess from start to finish, and I would book here again in a heartbeat.  I had a truly lovely stay in this charming 1940 Ballard house!   "
3510818,34560553,2015-06-09,18282235,Georgia,"Shannon was an amazing host and her apartment is a dream. She was extremely open and thorough in her communication leading up to the booking and provided very easy & clear check in instructions. The apartment itself is in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood with a beautiful, relaxing garden out back. I would definitely stay here again."
3510818,38406010,2015-07-15,29836233,Jen,"Shannon was very communicative and quick in response to questions, so A+ on the host front.

And, the place. This place is Amazing. There's an impressive attention to detail in the amenities (otter pops in the freezer, very well-stocked kitchen), delightful decor (awesome vintage everywhere, a record player!), and the little welcoming touches (like candies & truffles on the front side table).

Great stay. Great location. Great place. Highly recommend this for making your trip to Seattle even more of a treat."
3510818,39546867,2015-07-24,9235743,Casius & Cassie,"Shannon was great and so helpful. She made it easy for me to get in and her place is incredible! So beautiful, cozy and clean. The backyard was big and great as well! The neighborhood is perfect and there are lots of awesome restaurants and things to do nearby. I would definitely stay here again!"
3510818,43774801,2015-08-22,853239,Aloma,Shannon was easy to contact and very helpful. She promptly responded to any queries we had. Her place is charming and we enjoyed our stay
3510818,48523969,2015-09-27,12720408,Richard,"We loved the home. The street was easy to find parking on, right in front or near the home. Shannon was there to great us. I always like to meet the owner as it gives a personal touch rather than receiving a cold note. It started to get cool at night and the furnace quickly heated up the home. No worries here.  The location is close enough to walk to some very good breakfast and bakery spots. Meaning very safe neighborhood. Also an Uber ride to downtown Ballard is only $5-8. Downtown Ballard has a ton of great restaurants, breweries, and bars. Shannon does a great job explaining everything in person and also her house manual. The bed was comfortable, especially for this 6'7"" person. Plenty of closet and drawer space. Nice bathroom. The vintage furnishings and decorations are gorgeous. I would highly recommend staying here and will do so the next time we visit.

For our touristy activities, (Pikes Place, Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, MOHAI museum) might I recommend driving and parking in the pay lot near MOHAI,  then Uber or walk everywhere else. The ""catch"" is that you will have to go and visit MOHAI museum, which is a rather good history museum (easily spend hours there), and they validate your ticket, making your parked car only cost $5 for the entire day. Remember, you have to visit the museum for this to work. Do it on a Thursday and its even a better deal as the museum stays open until 8pm."
3510818,53643097,2015-11-10,1523625,Casey,Staying at Shannon's place was perfect for extended stay work trip. The house had all the comforts and conveniences with added touches like the turntable for playing records. Her interior design chops did not go unnoticed either. Very pleasant stay. Thanks Shannon!
6724599,35340510,2015-06-17,35241608,Nai-Hsuan,"The place is really nice and cozy. The neighborhood is wonderful, got plenty dining options. Bus #2 will be your best friend if you like to hang out around downtown. "
6724599,36045013,2015-06-24,7704843,Henryk,"Dawn was a very gracious and attentive host. The apartment was clean and very nice, and in a great and quiet neighborhood with easy access to attractions in the city."
6724599,36438028,2015-06-28,18505867,Chris,"Great location and accommodations.  The place was clean and private, Dawn was very friendly and helpful, and I would definitely recommend!"
6724599,37872872,2015-07-11,76379,Rose,"We had a great stay at Dawn's. The basement was spacious, clean and pleasant. We enjoyed the separate entrance going in and out and knowing we're not disturbing anyone. 

There was three of us and we used both the bed and the futon/sofa. The bed in the bedroom was very comfy. The sofa was just fine. 

Contact long Dawn was very convenient, she promptly responded to texts and had great tips for us about where to go, where to eat etc. 

I would highly recommend, it's a great place in a great location. "
6724599,39180963,2015-07-21,31315875,John,"The host was forthcoming with information about the house & neighbourhood & promptly answered any queries. She was also willing to let us use the yard & washing facilities. 
The neighbourhood was lovely & a short walk to shops & close to good bus service to downtown."
6724599,41763514,2015-08-09,6299089,Ryan,This is a wonderful home in a perfect location! Beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood with a coffee shop and restaurants right around the corner. Located on a bus line that takes you right to the Seattle Center and the waterfront. The space is charmingly historic and comfortable. Highly recommend!
6724599,42684300,2015-08-15,7553271,Liane,"Dawn promptly responded to my mails, which made communication regarding the stay very easy. 
We had a wonderful time in the basement. Everything was clean and well equipped and the bed was so comfortable. Dawn also provides lots of information on the place, the neighbourhood and public transportation. The bus to Downtown and a wonderful bakery are just around the corner - highly recommended for a weekend brunch!
Queen Anne is a lovely place we would love to return to. "
6724599,43694847,2015-08-21,33382380,Nandoc,"This is a lovely basement in a great location. Dawn provides lots of information about the neighborhood.  If you are a runner or like to go on long walks in the morning, there is a trail called Queen Anne Loop. It is a beautiful hilltop run with views that will take your breath away."
6724599,46300601,2015-09-09,18786030,Danielle,We had a great stay in Seattle with dawn. She was very nice and accommodating. Thanks again!! 
6724599,47271181,2015-09-17,21608913,Erin,"Dawn was an amazing host. She provided a wealth of information before we even arrived in Seattle that was very helpful in finalizing our plans. It was a pleasure to meet her, she is friendly and caring, even offering us jackets for the cold days as we had not adequately packed! The basement was spacious, equipped with everything you could need, and very clean. It was easy to come and go according to our schedule without inconveniencing the house. The Queen Anne neighborhood is beautiful and the bakery down the street was our favorite morning spot. It is conveniently located by the bus stop and there was always a car2go nearby, so it is easy to get around the city. This was a perfect place to stay!  "
6724599,48722734,2015-09-28,16810819,Ina,"Dawn was so easy to work with and made sure we had all the information needed before our arrival.  Even gave me a weather update just before we left home for Seattle.  And, although she didn't have a fan to loan us during our stay, she tracked one down and left it by our door.  The place may be a basement but with all the windows, it doesn't feel like one.  Super comfortable, clean and fantastic location.  Walking distance to lots of great coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants and shops.  Even a Trader Joe's and Safeway.  Will definitely be going back to Seattle, and Dawn's ""charming daylight basement"" will be my go to place to stay."
6724599,51054371,2015-10-17,38651870,Amanda,Great place with an easy commute downtown and some amazing local eateries.
6724599,51655280,2015-10-22,5804205,Heather,"We really enjoyed our stay in Dawn and Tim's daylight basement apartment. It is clean, tidy, spacious and comfortable ( good bed, shower, cooker), and they were generous in letting us use the washer and dryer- much appreciated when you are on a long voyage. Many basements are very gloomy and dank, but this one has a reasonable amount of light, and did not have that damp smell often apparent- thanks  D &T.

Tim and Dawn are delightful people who make you feel warmly welcomed ( whilst giving you plenty of privacy).

The suburb is green and leafy, with neighborhood shops and a regular bus service to town, and there are lots of cafes/restaurants and more shops just 15 mins walk away. Street parking was fine.

All up an excellent B&B location and accommodation option-highly recommended."
4250367,21268839,2014-10-13,22260502,Sara,"Queen Anne is the place to be in Seattle. Residential area but not far from downtown. This townhouse was spacious and clean, and free street parking and walkable distance to Citizen for crepes and coffee in the morning was a plus. We were able to rent it for a relatively reasonable rate b/c they haven't finished furnishing it entirely (TVs, pots, pans, extra linens, etc). We never dealt with the owner, just the property manager (via email, very responsive, kind and flexible with our travel dates) and the on-site manager (again, very responsive, kind and hospitable). "
4250367,22970027,2014-11-18,4130912,Gus,"Perfect house and location. Clean, spacious and with a great view. Host was attentive and helpful. "
4250367,23524238,2014-12-03,5308748,Tamra,"My family and I stayed here for a week over the Thanksgiving holiday, and the place was great. It was exactly as described. The views are fantastic, especially from the master bedroom, and the location is very close to downtown and Seattle Center. We slept with the blinds open each night to just take in the scene. 

There is everything you need to feel at home and comfortable. Parking is readily available, there are brand new nice appliances, the master bed is very comfortable, and there is a fireplace that was great to use on the cold, dark Seattle nights. The kitchen is well supplied, there are ample pillows/sheets/comforters, there is a nice big TV in the living room. There was both flat and sparkling bottled water, cereal, crackers and some fruit when we came in. We all enjoyed showers in the upstairs bathroom with the multiple shower heads. Good internet access. 

The place is less than a five minute drive from a great grocery store, QFC, which has an underground parking garage. You can easily stock up here and enjoy great home-made meals in the kitchen. "
4250367,27895120,2015-03-14,28514801,Zhun,"My friends and I spend our spring break in Seattle, and Jeff's house is the biggest surprise of the whole trip. The location is pretty good, no matter I want to go to the downtown, Chinatown, Pike Place Market,or space needle, it always takes me less than 10 minutes on the Taxi.  

The  view at night is fantastic. We open all the curtains in order to appreciate the scenery. Beds are pretty comfortable and in front of the bed, the TV are pretty big and you can watch DVDs if you like. Internet is very fast.

The Kitchen is clean and well supplied. When my friends and I want to cook dinner by ourself, there are all kinds of kitchenware and plates we need. By the way, the 7-11 and Dominos are pretty close.

I have a really good experience of staying in Jeff's house."
4250367,41060507,2015-08-04,28557816,Catja,"We had a wonderful stay at this property. After getting detailed instructions by mail, we were able to check ourselves in without any problems and even so Ron stopped by to make sure we got in OK. Since there were only four of us, we never even used the downstairs apartment. The rest of the house was very spacious and beautifully appointed with floor-to-ceiling windows that let in lots of light and provided an amazing view of the city, exactly as advertised. The kitchen was super well equipped with modern appliances and provided everything we needed to have breakfast and dinner with a spectacular view of the Space Needle every day. Despite its convenient proximity to the Seattle Center and downtown areas, the neighborhood is residential, so it was very quiet and there was always street parking available right by the house. We were able to walk to restaurants (though the steep Queen Anne hill is not for the faint of heart - or foot!) and a fabuluous local grocery store was less than five minutes away by car. The house also had other amenities we appreciated, such as the various bathrooms and the extra large washer and dryer. The beds were large and very comfortable with luxurious Egyptian cotton linens. Since we were very lucky to encounter fabulous weather in Seattle, we were also able to enjoy the two upstairs balconies as well as the little patio where a table and two chairs were enough to make our kids happy playing card games there. It did get quite hot in the upstairs bedrooms, though - the ceiling fan in the master bedroom and the extra fan that was provided in the second bedroom could only do so much to battle temperatures around 90. Still, the view was too nice to be given up in order to move into the downstairs bedroom! Overall, we absolutely loved this property and would recommend it without a moment's hesitation."
4250367,50541123,2015-10-12,45319262,Ralph,The house was terrific.  6 adults shared the house comfortably.  It is located convenient all points of interest.  We recommend it.
4250367,51028578,2015-10-17,12220866,Chandler,"This is a great place - clean, luxurious, great view of the space needle, nice neighborhood, plenty of consumables. The host also provides welcome bottled wine and dessert, which is unexpected. The stay was enjoyable and the manager was responsive on my other request. I would definitely recommend this place in future. "
4250367,55302451,2015-11-29,49758172,Shiding,"It's a great house to live in. We can see the wonderful night scenery from the window, and Host also provide enough daily articles and even provide a perfect sound system for us to spend trip with elegant music. Everything is Seattle is perfect!"
9154294,54061492,2015-11-15,48426205,Catherine,"It was a little bit noisy (dog and kids) from 5 to 7 but it was the last of our worry :) Beside that, we had a wonderful stay and we very appreciate the breakfast that Lisa gave us. The bed was SO confortable, and the extra blanket was cool too. We would recomand this place to anybody that would like to go to Seattle :)"
9154294,54659987,2015-11-22,36889725,Daniel,"Terrific place to stay in Wallingford/near UW! The rooms are beautiful, and there were some nice touches like leaving bagels and guides to the city out that really made us feel at home.  There were also bathrobes, which was really luxurious! Lisa gave us good directions, so it was easy to find. Even though we never met in person, she was extremely easy to reach via text or email and communicate with. Their street has really nice views of the lake and downtown. "
9154294,55868949,2015-12-06,49498090,Lilli,"Lisa was an amazing host to say the least! The pictures do not do this place justice it is so beautiful, everything looks brand new. Not to mention the view from the street you can see the whole city's skyline it's amazing. Lisa was even kind enough to give us a ride into the city one of the days we were there which was so sweet! This was probably the best air b&b experience we've had yet and I would highly recommend staying here if your in the city! "
7417852,42307313,2015-08-12,36096460,Marisa,"Everything was perfect! Marin was very accommodating, knowledgable, and welcoming to her home. The house has a very homey feel and is very eclectic! We stayed 6 days and didn't feel homesick once! We saw Marin maybe 3 times which allowed us to have our privacy but also get some great information about Seattle. She is very easy going and genuinely interested in her guests. It is very easy to communicate with her via phone or text if you have questions. Everything was clean and very ""Seattle"". It was a great place to stay if you want a feel for what it'd be like to live in Seattle. The house seemed designed to be accommodating to travelers. We were easily able to Uber to the light rail to get downtown. Definitely hope to stay with Marin again in the future!! "
7417852,44357979,2015-08-25,41149590,Johnnie,"Marin is wonderful!  I honestly don’t believe that I could have chosen a better home and host.  The sunny room was inviting  and the bed was comfortable.  The entire house was clean, cozy and comfortable, with plenty of attention to detail with respect to accommodations for guests.  We felt very much at home.  Our flight came in very late at night and there was no problem checking in.  The house was easy to find.  Parking was available on the street.  Inside the home was easy to navigate with instructions provided for anything that might be needed, not in plain sight.  There was plenty of privacy time and space as well as good company and conversation should you catch Marin at home.  The house and neighborhood is absolutely charming.   Although I enjoyed drinking the readily available coffee and tea at the house, I also enjoyed taking a short peaceful walk to the Tin Umbrella coffee shop. I certainly hope to stay here again during my next visit to Seattle.  

"
7417852,45415061,2015-09-02,41509963,Tom,"Marin was the perfect host. Her home is comfortable, and the room was exactly as shown in the photo. The queen sized bed was a plus, and her home is near public transportation via the number 7 bus along Ranier Ave or light rail. With access to a kitchen and a BBQ in the backyard, I was able to cook about 1/2 my meals. She also has information on local places to eat and discover, when you want to go out. I am already thinking of a return visit next year.  "
7417852,46001795,2015-09-07,7643491,Bert,"Marin is the best!  Her home is thoughtfully staged for her guests, and she goes out of her way to make you feel at home.  Wonderful home, wonderful host."
7417852,46681831,2015-09-12,43095659,Dylan,"We stayed with Marin for 2 nights, and  it was great. We had a wonderful time. Had some good chats about what to do in Seattle, Marin has a wealth of knowledge to share about the city.

The room itself was great, big and bright and the bed was super comfortable. We had access to everything in the kitchen and were made to feel very much at home."
7417852,47135066,2015-09-15,7643491,Bert,"Marin is awesome!  Second time staying with her,  had a great time, as usual.  Great place to stay, you won't be disappointed."
7417852,48042714,2015-09-22,29130393,Marcus,"Marin was very welcoming and friendly from the moment I arrived until the day I left. She was knowledgeable about the area, and provided some information about local eateries, markets, and bus routes in the area. 
I had a great time staying at Marin's house and I highly recommend it to anyone. "
7417852,48473164,2015-09-26,29130393,Marcus,"My second stay with Marin was as good as my first. Super cool person, super cool house, super cool backyard.

I say ""Yay"" to staying here. "
7417852,52072794,2015-10-26,30604271,Meixi,"Marin has been an absolute delight to live with. From the moment I met her, she was warm and inviting just like her beautiful home, which is her brainchild and labor of love many years in the making. It has a wonderfully welcoming living room with comfy couches and abundant windows that let the sunlight pour in, connecting to her kitchen where she provides almost every cooking utensil and appliance you could desire. Her house is bookended front and back with a lovely garden and porch+swing and a fenced in backyard with a grill and lots of seating to enjoy the Seattle weather. She always has recommendations about where to eat and magical stories about what to do in the surrounding areas. She lives conveniently close to the 7 bus and a 15 minute walk from the light rail. Her neighborhood is filled with the cutest little homes where everyone's garden has its own distinct personality. Hers is filled with raspberry and blackberry and strawberry plants as well as abundant herbs for cooking. As someone looking at Seattle as a potential place to live, I can't imagine a more serendipitous pairing than I had with Marin--a Seattle lover through and through. The month went by far too quickly, but I'll be back for good with belongings in tow and a laundry list of adventures to go on with the new friend I've made."
7417852,52804245,2015-11-01,47712744,Wallis,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was excellent. The room was large, airy, and cheerful just as described and my host, Marin was simply a marvelous person. A comfortable bed in a welcoming home and a long coffee chat with my host made this a memorable stay."
7417852,54311927,2015-11-18,28762665,Jaquelyn,"Marin was particularly accommodating and anticipated all my needs for the arrival.   I appreciated her attention to details like offering me a beer and laying out a clean towel.  Her bedding is first rate - it felt like a luxury hotel.  As an added bonus, we had killer conversation.  I'd stay with Marin again and again."
4038347,19580494,2014-09-14,20161706,Matthew,The listing was accurately represented and Lisa and her son were welcoming. The listing was a good value in a quiet neighborhood just outside of downtown Seattle. The location offered a good alternative to I-5 with a main road directly to downtown Seattle being a block away form the street Lisa's home is on. 
4038347,20776928,2014-10-05,5098862,James,"Lisa was very nice and friendly. Room has ample closet space and dresser. House is located right off the E rapid, which gets you to/from downtown in about 20-30 minutes. I was doing research at UW, which was about a 30 minute bus ride off the 48. Greenwood also has a nice strip on Greenwood Ave, good cafes and restaurants, plus a  cocktail lounge."
4038347,21173875,2014-10-12,9882332,Walter,"I would never recommend this host. First, the house was really messy,  I never used the living room even one time. the bathroom was quite messy as well. I spent most on my time at a medical conference and stayed out as much as I could so I would avoid the messy environment. I booked 3 nights but I was unable to continue to staying there. I left after two day and as her profile states, she has flexible cancellation policy. I left early at 0800 and requested a days refund but she declined to honor her own policy. No beef, this I ended up paying for the rest of the stay. 
That said, Lisa was prompt in replying to messages. She was however unable to present me with the keys until after the first night, and I had to request for it. The location is great for what I was to do in Seattle, close to University of Washington. 
"
4038347,21327061,2014-10-14,18012854,Mankit,Nice location.  Only 10 minute walk to Greenwood and 20 minute ride to downtown
4038347,21451563,2014-10-17,9233755,Dianne,"The house has very good location, room nice, clean and spacy. Lisa is very nice, easy to communicate, she just made some potato soup when I arrived and offered me, so nice!"
4038347,21559000,2014-10-19,8940751,Martin,Lisa was a very accommodating host. The room was comfortable. Excellent public transportation to downtown Seattle. 
4038347,22048448,2014-10-28,4077794,Trang,Lisa (and her son!) were very nice/accomodating. Room was as described. Internet was a plus. Hope he feels better! :)
4038347,22382454,2014-11-04,22489587,Tom,"Bed was very comfy, photos in the listing are accurate. Very easy to get to downtown Seattle on the bus. Lisa pretty much left me to my own devices which was ideal."
4038347,22940936,2014-11-17,705404,Matt,"This is a great place to crash. Lisa was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was safe, quiet, and with ample parking, as described. I was in and out because of an early flight, and got everything I needed for a great price."
4038347,23000994,2014-11-19,7693924,Drew,Lisa is so great!  She was very gracious and made me feel very welcome.  The room is nice and clean and the bed is SO comfortable!  Best sleep I've gotten in quite some time! 
4038347,23731030,2014-12-08,4273174,Bruce,"Lisa was very nice, and accommodating. The neighborhood was nice and the room was a good size and comfortable. "
4038347,24159796,2014-12-21,24719128,Justin,"Lisa's been very pleasant during my stay, which I actually extended by another week (to a total of two) after feeling things out the first few nights.

She has been very accommodating and has generally left me to my own devices unless I engage her in conversation, and is friendly in the passing.

I haven't had any issues during my stay, and I'd use this place again should the need arise."
4038347,24389833,2014-12-27,24719128,Justin,"Extended previous stay, pleasant experience all around.

See previous review for more info."
4038347,25624397,2015-01-20,26134860,Hayden,"Lisa was nice and accommodating. The house was messy, but the room was clean with clean bed sheets. The bathroom was messy, and the shower is lower, so something to consider if you're taller. She provided fresh soap and a clean towel. I was given my own space and privacy. "
4038347,25913395,2015-01-29,10372721,Matthew,Had a great time at Lisa's place. She was very friendly and welcoming. Her knowledge of Seattle and the world was very much appreciated. The location has great parking which is highly valuable because many parts of the city lack easy parking. The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. Her sense of humor is great as well. The area is close to bus stops and coffee shops if needed. The desk in the dining room was totally acceptable for doing any work. Used it quite often at night with no problem. The bed is large and comfortable and the neighborhood is very quiet. So overall I had a great time and learned a lot from Lisa. 
4038347,26654007,2015-02-16,1726057,Kym And Fred,Yes the room described exactly as it looks in the ad.  Lisa was very accommodating and helpful.  Her location was less than a half mile from the conference site I was attending which was perfect.  I was hardly there except late at night.  It was easy to navigate to food and drink.  She is very sweet as is her 4 year old son.
4038347,27749811,2015-03-10,13300186,Jaya,"Lisa was a wonderful host towards me. She has a nice house to live in and it was 20 min - 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle which is very convenient. I had a nice time leaving in her place when I needed a place to stay. Thank you, Lisa."
4038347,28631257,2015-03-27,28883377,Ken,Lisa was very pleasant and accommodating.  The room was a good size and the neighborhood was quite.  
4038347,28762866,2015-03-29,2136037,Kirsten,"Lisa was pleasant and a good host, the room was clean and comfortable, and the neighbourhood is nice and quiet. However, it does not mention in the listing that she has a four-year-old boy who sleeps in the neighbouring room, and I think that's very important for establishing expectations as to what the atmosphere and noise level in a home will be. I had booked this room only needing a quiet place to sleep overnight. I arrived late at night after a long, tiring day driving, and was very taken aback to be greeted by a boisterous child. He's a cute kid and Lisa seems like a good mom. But even the best-behaved four-year-old boy is still going to be bursting with energy, and it's not fair not to tell people up front to expect this. Some people won't mind a bit, but those of us who are light sleepers want to be able to confidently pick accommodations where we can expect quiet."
4038347,30156715,2015-04-18,70666,Cherilyn,"This was a great spot, close to a bus and as described. It was for my son to stay while relocating to the area and it was a great value and good location. "
4038347,30747013,2015-04-26,26157845,Rena,"I was comfortable at Lisa's house.  I had what I needed, a private space to rest at night while busy with work in the city.  If the timing works out I'd like to stay at Lisa's house again."
4038347,31219539,2015-05-03,30935603,Andrew,"The room is exactly as shown in the photos. The neighborhood is relatively quiet, and there is parking on the street. It is very close to stores and restaurants.  Lisa is good at making you feel welcome and making sure your are comfortable."
4038347,31615553,2015-05-07,1431939,Danbee,"The room was clean, and Lisa was very welcoming. The place was near the public transportation stops which made it convenient to get around"
4038347,32134502,2015-05-14,15977351,Benjamin,I had a great time staying at Lisa's house. She was very welcoming and the room was bright and homey. The neighborhood was great and close to lots of tasty restaurants.
4038347,32284833,2015-05-16,10088549,Patricia,I good a good experience staying at Lisa's. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Lisa was very welcoming and friendly. This place is perfect if you need easy access to I-5.
4038347,35617292,2015-06-20,32150816,Brahmjot,"Lisa was a fantastic host. Although, I arrived very late in the day to her apartment, she ensured to welcome me and provide the basic stuff to have a nice stay. The location was very nice in a safe neighborhood with easy access to bus to downtown. 

I will definitely stay again at her place!"
4038347,35891267,2015-06-22,34536739,Sarah,"The room was exactly as advertised. Lisa was very nice and offered water, towels, and key to the house. She was able to accommodate my last minute reservation and late checkin! I felt comfortable coming and going as needed and parking in the area was just fine.

A few things to note: Lisa does not run the house much like a B+B or hotel. You are simply renting a room in an active, busy house. She has a kid who stays with her some of the time. So, be forewarned it's just going to be a bit louder if he is there. Bathroom is shared (and quite messy) but close to the room. 

This was a great place for me and for the price."
4038347,36578397,2015-06-29,16095373,Athar,"Lisa is Very nice and friendly person.
The Room was very clean.
She provided me iron for clothes.
I am very happy with her.
Suggestions : 
1. Please provide Fan in the room in summer time.
2. Bathroom have so many used/ unused thing. Please keep the only things guests needed."
4038347,36919811,2015-07-02,3833141,Amy,"Lisa was very friendly. It was very hot in Seattle when i was there and she gave me the fan out of her room to use, which was very nice. She also provided bottled water upon arrival. Her place is a short walk to the restaurants on Greenwood. "
4038347,38110808,2015-07-13,31250525,Orlando,"I am very grateful for the hospitality and friendliness of Lisa.
  It was a great experience I had stayed at home.
The habtacion is spacious and bright, with a large, soft bed, where sleep is placentero.El bathroom is shared with a large shower pressure.
  His home has fruit trees (fig and apple trees), which dated back to me my childhood.
  The neighborhood is aromatic and peaceful, with large gardens, with rosemary, lavender, pine and cypress.
  One block no public locomotion, which is very efficient and punctual, which allows to reach the center of Seattle in an expeditious manner.
   Lisa was very friendly, she kindly helped me meet my requirements."
4038347,38644169,2015-07-17,25528652,Bob,"
This   was my first  experience with Airbnb, and it  was  a very 
positive  experience....My flight got in later than I anticipated,
but she told me   not to worry..I arrived at the house..she showed me the room and the (email hidden) it all went  well...I would get up early 
and  try to see as much of  Seattle as  possible..I would be  gone all day,and come back and go to bed..so we did not really have much
chance to interact...as I was  leaving, she came out and said good by
The bed  was  comfortable, the shower was  great , nice residential
neighborhood ..the  bus  stop was only two minutes from the house
and took me  downtown in about 20 minutes....there is an area
about  10 minutes  from the house with lots of restaurants all in all
a  pleasant  stay "
4038347,39416729,2015-07-23,37042684,Miho,Lisa is a kind and friendly person. The room was clean and comfortable. The place is easy to find and close to bus stations. I could walk down to Green Lake and the lake is a great place to relax and for walking or running.
4038347,39711844,2015-07-25,7559894,Korby,"Had a lovely time here! Lisa is a communicative and gracious host, and made everything quite easy. House is on a hill, and there's a great backyard / patio section that she invited me to use, which I did, doing work on a laptop. Backyard has some adorable chickens and a fig tree (Lisa let me have a sample: was delicious). The bed was quite comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Pleasantly woke up each morning to the sound of birds. Would come back here for sure.

If you're coming to town to check out UW, I would recommend staying here, as it's a quick 10-minute drive away, but more charming and quiet than anything you'll find in the U-District.
"
4038347,39888986,2015-07-26,38490742,Miguel,Great stay for my first airbnb. Confortable bed & clean room.

4038347,40977670,2015-08-03,17105782,Akiko,"Lisa was very caring, sweet and accommodating. Her place was perfectly what I needed for a one night stay and I slept like a baby. "

4038347,41842464,2015-08-09,22792,Leigh,"Lisa was very friendly and kind. The price couldn't be beat! And the location was perfect for my needs.
Since I am an ex-Seattlite Lisa didn't have to guide me or provide suggestions but my guess is if you needed help or suggestions she would not hesitate.
It was easy to come and go which I appreciated.
Thank you, Lisa!!!!!"
4038347,42031807,2015-08-10,3857778,Justin,The room was clean and cozy and just as advertised.  I would stay at the location again.  Even let me borrow a phone charger.  
4038347,42311906,2015-08-12,35494820,Lauren,Lisa was great and greeted me when I got there. The bed was super comfy and location walkable to the bus station. Would definitely recommend! 
4038347,45608593,2015-09-04,7395808,Maaike,"Lisa was a very nice host. She even prepared some food for me when I got in late from the airport on the first night. The room is comfortable and clean, and there is a good bus connection to downtown."
4038347,46531743,2015-09-11,34233526,Azusa,"She is awesome! she always welcomed to ask any questions or helps. The location is very nice and quiet and the bus station is just 5minuts walk from the house. I had a private room which is clean and nice. The best part of this staying is that the bed is super comfy!!!! If you are planning to stay in Seattle, I do recommend this place. Thanks Lisa! "
4038347,52033211,2015-10-25,8880284,Jun,"As always, Lisa is welcoming, kind, and accommodating. It's a true pleasure to stay at her place!
 "
4038347,52552928,2015-10-30,47270584,James,"I had a lovely time at Lisa's place. The room was very clean and comfortable, just as presented in the photos, with some bottled water provided-- a thoughtful touch that made me feel welcome immediately. She even brought me delicious homemade cookies when I first arrived!

The house was just what I was looking for-- close enough to downtown, but quiet enough to find some peace and calm. Lisa was very accommodating-- she was happy to talk about local places to eat or see and offer recommendations. Overall a very nice experience.

1520549,9341956,2013-12-23,8169311,Darren,"The hacker house was a great place to stay for the 4 months that I was in Seattle. There are a lot of restaurants close by so one does not have to cook, but there's also a QFC within walking distance if cooking is your thing. The house does attract people in their mid-20s, so the cleanliness of the kitchen depends on those you live with. Otherwise, the house captain Matt keeps the place nice and organized. The walk to SLU is around 20-25 minutes, but the walk back is all uphill, so it might take longer. There are a lot of workspaces in the house. Overall, it's a really nice place to stay."
1520549,11431143,2014-04-02,11653217,Leonardo,I enjoyed my stay at hacker house. I felt very welcome. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hacker house to a friend. 
1520549,18702488,2014-08-31,8039246,Cameron,"Matt is awesome! Excellent location (20 mins walk to SLU) and people in the house. I spent three  months there during my summer internship.  However, the cleanliness wasn't good for the first two months (lots of fruit flies at the first floor). After getting weekly housekeeper, it became much better."
1520549,49144234,2015-10-01,13325816,Kim,"Perfectly pleasant accommodations for a couple weeks while I was getting settled in the city. The house is definitely old and probably overdue for a remodel, but they've made it quite comfortable. The kitchen's a bit crowded with so many people sharing it, and some of the shared ingredients can be dodgy, so watch out for that. The fruit flies mentioned in previous reviews are still around, but kept mostly under control by the scheduled cleanings. The wifi was excellent and the people were all great."
4208555,22509391,2014-11-08,5854805,Alicia,"Allison was great-speedy on correspondence and flexible when I had last minute travel plans. The unit is well thought out with beautiful and thoughtful touches. The bed was super comfortable too! The neighborhood is super cute with some great amenities within walking distance (Allison had left a map, indicating the location of restaurants and places of interest within walking distance to the house). I would stay here again but would find it easier to navigate with a car however it is manageable taking the buses especially when your plans include staying in town for longer periods of time. I would recommend this unit to friends and hope to use it again when I am back in Seattle.

Alicia"
4208555,23247772,2014-11-26,18769696,Nate,"Everything was perfect. The place was adorable and Allison was super-responsive. Overall, great place to stay."
4208555,23353956,2014-11-29,4463872,Savannah & Todd,"Allison and John's apartment was the perfect place for us to rest our heads after a long (and snowy!) day of driving. They were so quick to respond to our accommodation request, and kept in touch with us even though it was during their Thanksgiving holiday. We look forward to staying with them again if we have a future trip to Seattle!"
4208555,23913964,2014-12-14,13679912,Jessica,"Allison and John were great hosts, very responsive with quick replies to all my questions.

I look forward to staying there again the next time I visit Seattle."
4208555,23969803,2014-12-15,5300420,Mathew,"Allison and John's place is very cozy and relaxing. I really enjoyed the space, and they have one of the most comfortable beds I've had in an AirBnB! The space is as nice as it appears in the photos and is larger than you'd think. Both Allison and John were very good about staying in contact and were very responsive to my questions. I would stay there again and I will recommend them to my friends. "
4208555,24257535,2014-12-23,5778301,Andy,The place is absolutely cozy. We loved it!
4208555,24346997,2014-12-26,25005000,Lesley,"We stayed at Allison and John's on Christmas Day, so we could visit and celebrate Christmas with our daughter who is attending UW. They were very gracious, the room was clean, comfortable and inviting. They even left cookies and small tree. There is a living room and separate bedroom, along with a small kitchenette (fridge, coffee and microwave) We were very pleased with our stay. "
4208555,24659413,2015-01-01,9177327,Linda,"We had a great time staying at Allison & John's place over New Years! My parents were visiting from New York and we were looking for a nice place that was walking distance to the Greenlake area where we were meeting friends. It worked perfectly for us and it was great to be just a 15 minute walk away from home base at the end of the night. John and Allison were great to plan with, flexible with check-in/out times and we met John briefly as well. The suite is nicely decorated and we appreciated the beer lending library as well. All in all a lovely airbnb!"
4208555,25448624,2015-01-16,421790,Amy,"What a great space!  My mom and I had a wonderful time in the city, and this location was perfect for our time.   Thanks for a clean, cozy, and convenient spot. "

Arts around the place gave great character! Will definitely book with Allison and John when I come back to Seattle again! Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
4208555,25820661,2015-01-26,6793084,Aliki,a wonderful suite in a fabulous neighborhood! the bed is SO comfortable! Allison and John were very helpful when i needed their assistance.. although i didn't meet them personally. i'd stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. :)
4208555,26114745,2015-02-03,22783085,Stefanie,"Allison and John's suite is beautiful and cozy. When we arrived, Allison and John were home and came out to say hello. It's so nice to be on vacation and feel like you are at home. The suite is just as pictured and has everything you need - microwave, fridge, extra beddings, toiletries, tv, laundry machine, and even a Keurig! The location of the house is perfect with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby and just a short drive away from downtown. I would definitely recommend this suite to anyone who is in Seattle and wants a cozy place to stay."
4208555,26571456,2015-02-15,27509930,Cassandra,"Allison and John did a great job of making their space cozy and appealing. They were very friendly in all our communication, and made our first Airbnb experience easy and enjoyable. 

The home was cute, the space was easily accessible, and the neighborhood was in the perfect location for everything we needed to do this weekend. 
"
4208555,27041057,2015-02-23,17294567,Cassandra,"Alli and John were awesome hosts; very easy-going with our last-minute booking and had great communication throughout. They space is very roomy and comfortable, with thoughtful touches throughout, such as the hand-drawn, color-coded map and pay-it-forward beer fridge. Great experience overall!"
4208555,27187429,2015-02-27,4838038,Tim,My wife and I could not have been happier with the space. Everything was exactly as described with several extra nice-to-haves. Thanks for everything! We'll definitely look here first for our next Seattle trip!
4208555,27283596,2015-03-01,24749443,John & Dawn,Thank you for a great place for my sister and brother-in-law. Your place was even better in person than in the pictures. They loved it. Thanks again. 
4208555,27753273,2015-03-10,28194775,Sara,"Allison and John's suite was delightful! It's in the perfect area for being close to everything, without losing the tranquil home feel. They were extremely accommodating with us, this was a super last minute decision and we would definitely recommend their place to anyone wanting the same great experience we had in the short amount of time we were in Seattle. "
4208555,27862688,2015-03-13,5446759,Steven,"Allison and John's place was fantastic! It was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle. We brought a pack-n-play for our toddler and there was more than enough room. The suite is very private, clean and close to the city. It was in a great neighborhood with plenty of personality and on-street parking and we felt completely safe. Next time we are in Seattle we will definitely try to stay here again."
4208555,27940570,2015-03-15,16264399,Patti,"We had a lovely stay. Parking was easy, the suite was large and nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. It was great to have the private keypad entrance so we could come and go without worries about bothering anyone. The binder with information and tips was a nice touch. We also appreciated the soft towels, Keurig coffee, free (fast) wifi, and fridge (oops, that we left some salad in :) The hosts were also super nice. We'd definitely stay again!"
4208555,28223805,2015-03-20,21816627,Susie,"Allison and John were amazing hosts, they were available to hangout and designed their space to instantly be welcoming. The private entrance was convenient and the apartment felt like home. The amenities were a great addition and accurately listed in the description. The Ravenna neighborhood is so nice, quiet, yet close enough to the Seattle City Center to visit every day.  
The only thing we regret is that we didn't have time to hang out with Allison and John. "
4208555,28528389,2015-03-25,28433833,Danny,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in John and Allison's home. The place was just like the pictures had shown and each room was clean and ready for us when we arrived. The location in the Roosevelt neighborhood was perfect for our needs; it was a quiet setting and yet it was just a few miles from the center of Seattle. If we find ourselves back in Seattle, John and Allison's home will be the first place we look to stay. "
4208555,28811737,2015-03-30,3126474,Shivaun,"Alli and and John were so lovely to stay with! The house was super quiet, very comfortable and well appointed. We had all the space we needed and more, and they thought of everything! Street parking was an absolute breeze. Thanks again for everything!"
4208555,29058579,2015-04-03,20434849,Richard,"Since we were quite busy and came for a few nights during the week, we didn't meet Allison and John.  The communication was great, we felt at home and comfortable in their basement apartment.  Everything was in order and as it appears on their posting.  Loved the location and would recommend to anyone needing a nice, comfortable, and affordable space in the area."
4208555,29121453,2015-04-04,15427084,Julie,This house was extremely adorable and comfortable.  Our host made sure we had everything we would need during our stay and the description was very accurate.  The neighborhood was also very quiet and safe.  We would definitely stay here again.
4208555,29341181,2015-04-06,428881,Deirdre,"Allison and John were wonderful hosts - very communicative, helpful - even left the heat on for us to warm up the space before we arrived. The space is darling, nicely decorated , water and drinks in the fridge, shampoos in the shower. Great neighborhood, great place!"
4208555,29684764,2015-04-11,19710345,Rhonda And Michael,"This is a really terrific suite!  Though on the lower level, it is very cozy and warm feeling.  Attention to detail was really great - from instructions for using the Amazon Firestick to small amenities provided in the bathroom (e.g., cotton swabs).  The bed was very comfortable.  My teenage son slept on the pullout couch and had no complaints.  The bathroom was great with a nice shower.  Fridge and Keurig machine are convenient,  though we did not utilize them.  Access to the suite was very simple and secure.  Parking was a snap; always had a space in front of their house.  

While we did not interact with John or Allison, they were accessible via phone/text.  Very responsive with a couple of questions I had.  

The neighborhood seems really great.  Green Lake is about 1 mile away.  If you're a runner or walker, there is about a 3 mile (a little under) loop around the lake that is really terrific.   We accessed different parts of the city by car with ease from their neighborhood.  We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!"
4208555,30419385,2015-04-21,1851528,Ann,"I had a wonderful, relaxing  stay in Allison and John's  cozy Private Suite.  The apartment is a quiet, sweet little hideaway; stylishly appointed with a newly remodeled bathroom; supremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. It also had many thoughtful touches such as the ""minibar"" refrigerator, a Keurig coffee maker (with delicious selections of teas as well), beautiful Northwest themed magazines to peruse,  a binder with helpful information, suggestions and charming, colorful hand drawn maps of the area. Heck, even the chalkboard display of the password for internet access was cute!  Parking was ample and easy; access through the private keypad entrance was a breeze and every time I stepped into the back yard in all my comings and goings, I was greeted by the sweet fragrances of lilac bushes and a huge apple tree covered in blossoms.  My only regret is that I didn't have more time to sit outside and enjoy the sights and scents during my stay.  It was such  a pleasure meeting Allison and John. They are a lovely couple, warm and friendly both in their communications and in person. 
I highly recommend a stay with them on your next trip to the Emerald City! "
4208555,31000515,2015-04-30,29578929,Kathrine,Boendet var fantastiskt och med Allisons och Johns vägbeskrivning gjorde det lätt att hitta. Smidigt med buss och metro. Man kommer in med egen kod så inget väntande eller krånglande med nycklar. Extra plus för trevlig ölkyl med kompis system ta en öl lämna en öl. 
4208555,31812135,2015-05-10,30976596,Michael,"Allison & John were great to work with. The night that we made the reservation they contacted us and made us feel immediately comfortable. This was the first AirBNB I'd ever done so I was a little apprehensive, but they eased all my worries. 

I checked out reviews first (who doesn't do that, anymore) and could find nothing but positive things. From the time that we arrived Allison & John were available for anything we needed - although there wasn't much that we needed. The space was perfect. 

The space was very clean and had a cool vibe to it. I like that there's a separate entrance around the back of the house. We only got to see them a couple of times and felt bad to intrude and our only regret is that we didn't ask them for some more tips on the area. That being said the handbook was really helpful (with some local dives) and we liked that it was pet free, they were environmentally conscious and tidy.

If you're looking to get into the city or other parts (like the heart of University District or any of the other districts for that matter) you may want to rent a car. If you're staying for a while, taxis, or public transportation can get expensive quick. We found the best thing to do was take an Uber (you get a $20 discount on your first ride - find it online) and rent a car from the airport.  Much much much cheaper.

You're pretty close to pretty much everything (if you don't mind a 10 to 15 minute drive). I wish we would have had more time to get outside the city (to see Rainier, trails, etc.) but the city is beautiful. University District is very well kept with some older homes with lots of charm. We liked that we got to stay where locals live and not in a sterile retail/hotel district where everything has the same feel. I feel like a true local. It was awesome.

Have already recommended Allison & John to friends that are visiting in the fall and may ask to stay again when my wife and I visit Seattle again.

Great experience!  Really couldn't be happier."
4208555,32771872,2015-05-21,32229628,Michelle,"We loved our time spent at Allison and John's place! It was cute, nice, neat, and very convenient. It seemed like pretty much anything we needed was available which was very helpful. Everything was very comfy and it felt a bit like home, checking into hotel could never achieve that. Staying at their suite definitely added to the amazing trip we had. My daughter and I wish you both the best. Thanks!"
4208555,33143916,2015-05-25,13847547,Ryan,"The apartment was great! Super comfortable and reminded me of home. Having the hair dryer and toiletries in the bathroom was a nice touch. Allison and John were excellent at communication and even picked up a package that we had sent there (forgot our camera charger!) The apartment was exactly as described and like the pictures. The neighborhood was quiet and we had no trouble finding street parking (free) directly in front of the house. I liked the way the apartment was behind the main house and away from the main street. We also enjoyed their backyard and patio. Very comfortable bed, nice renovated bathroom and living room area. We used the new, high-tech washer and dryer, which was also very convenient. It was just what we were looking for. Only about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown (longer during rush hour) and convenient location for exploring Seattle. It was not downtown, but this was actually better because it made parking and getting in and out easier. We really enjoyed going to the University of Washington's Waterfront Activities Center, very close to the apartment, where you can rent cheap rowboats and canoes on Lake Washington.  We would definitely recommend Allison and John's apartment to anyone traveling to Seattle. Thanks for making our stay so nice!"
4208555,34335858,2015-06-07,7821211,Daniel,Allison and John's place was very comfortable and in a pleasant neighborhood. We didn't bump into them during our stay but they had left information for us and were easily contactable. Check-in/out times were very flexible.
4208555,35937643,2015-06-23,5812243,Shannon,"We had a great time! It was easy to find, John & Allison had thought of every detail with maps, directions for using the TV, and a beer exchange set-up in the little fridge!  The accommodations were very clean and looked just like the pictures. Quite a gem. "
4208555,36686824,2015-06-30,32674129,Annie,"The apartment was wonderful. It was just as advertised. The suite was spacious and the kitchenette worked perfectly for our stay. The beds were comfortable and the premises were well-kept. The location was a short 6 block drive from the expressway exit.
We would stay again.
Thank you."
4208555,37329744,2015-07-06,660523,Leslie,"Allison & John's suite was perfect for our weekend getaway to Seattle! Very clean, home-y and well-stocked... from toiletries, to Keurig pods to extra linens and towels, they had it all! The queen bed was quite comfortable, as was the sofa. Despite being out of town during most our stay, Allison & John incredibly responsive and attentive. Parking was plentiful on their street, and location was top-notch... whole foods, safeway and restaurants were all within 1mi of their house. Looking forward to staying again in the future!!"
4208555,38525952,2015-07-16,706807,Kelila,"This is a fantastic find! Allison and John have beautifully appointed their units, which was very comfortable. There is even a welcome binder with recommendations for things to do and places to eat. It looks newly remodeled, with nice furniture and fresh linens. Communication and access was easy. Would happily stay here again!"
4208555,38914045,2015-07-19,36819315,Matt,"Allison and John were very welcoming.  The private suite with kitchenette had many windows which offered great natural light.  Additionally, the WiFi was easy and included access to AmazonTV.  This is a great deal!"
4208555,39361590,2015-07-22,3271878,Patricia,Allison and John were very prompt in responding to our request and provided a lovely home.  The location was a short 10-15 minute drive to the downtown area. Lots of local spots to visit close to their home. We loved all the special touches and what organization!  So impressed with all of the details. Allison and John~  THANK YOU both for making your spot so comfy for us. The bed was perfect.  I slept like a baby.  You have a very special place. :) Only regrets are that we didn't stay longer and we didn't get to meet you in person.  We will look you up the next time we visit.  Wish you the best!
4208555,39817470,2015-07-26,35862068,Christy,"BETTER THAN A HOTEL!! Allison and John made us feel very welcome and comfortable even before our trip.  Our flight landed at 1030pm and I was concerned about finding their home or being able to get in the home since it was so late. They sent me exact directions and it was very easy to get in and get settled for the night. The place was spacious, very clean, comfortable, and fully stocked. They thought of everything: fans in every room, water bottles, extra towels, blankets, wifi password, and coffee. We even stayed in one night and watched a movie, the info was so easy to follow to be able to stream a movie. They were always a text away and were fast to respond. Plenty of hot water for showers, easy access to downtown, and in a great neighborhood. I was worried about street parking but there was always an open spot right in front of their home. It was great that there was private access and we did not have to interrupt their daily activities. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend it! "
4208555,40485260,2015-07-31,173679,Briana,This was a great place to stay while my family looked for an apartment. The neighborhood is quite but still walkable to some cute places on 65th and a nice little park. The back yard is also spacious and has a nice little table. The hosts were very thoughtful and have things set up for all the basic needs in a very clean and cute space. 
4208555,41235896,2015-08-05,36821310,Rolando,"Allison and John were a good host. The place was nice and cozy, stocked with everything you will need including beverages. Nice touch on the local beer!  Most of all, it's very convenient to UW and the Village. Thank you for letting us use your place and we will definitely be back.

4208555,43288768,2015-08-18,8891880,Clare,Allison and John were very helpful.  The apartment was a great find-close to the bus line too!  It's great having laundry available.
4208555,44977801,2015-08-30,6260290,Asma,"Allison and John were very helpful and understanding of our late check in. We drove 17 hrs to get here and the check in process could not have been easier. There is an access keypad so its pretty easy. We didn't get to see much of them until the very last day as they were out of town but Allison was only a text away! 

The place is very clean and cute and spacious surprisingly. It was near some really good restaurants (go to Fat Ducks Deli & bakery for some bfast) and they made a book of suggestions so that was nice. The backyard and lighting with table at night is a nice touch especially in the summer. It is very private. Parking was never a problem, always a spot in front of the house. 

We would definitely stay here again and recommend this place!"
4208555,45287699,2015-09-01,34364486,Megan,"Allison and John were super attentive right from the moment we booked our trip. They made sure the room would be available to suit our arrival schedule and gave detailed instructions on how to get to their house as well as how to access the suite. They also recommended great dinner places and provided us with a forgotten HDMI cable.

The suite is really lovely - one bedroom, a study and a separate living area with a bathroom and kitchenette. It's adorably decorated and very clean. They also have a backyard patio area for guests to use that's very charming.

Allison and John were great hosts and we would stay again"
4208555,45713872,2015-09-05,22040406,Kathy,"This is a cozy little place! Love the extra 'study' room and the party lighted porch looking out onto the ancient apple tree! Allison and John were attentive to our every need, and the unit  felt nicely clean. Just wish the 'kitchenette' had a sink :) , but bathroom sink suffices. Keurig machine was terrific! Thank you Allison and John! "
4208555,46907768,2015-09-14,3461259,Julie,"The description was spot on!  My boyfriend and k had a great time staying here at Allison and Johns place.  The place was easy to find and private so we didn't feel like we were intruding. Great location in Seattle - not far from downtown and in a great neighborhood located close (walkable distances) to parks, grocery store, and restaurants!

I would totally recommend this and look forward to using this place again in the future!  Thanks Allison and John!"
4208555,48408693,2015-09-26,36821310,Rolando,Another fantastic stay with Allison and John.  Thank you again for letting use your lovely home and will certainly be back.
4208555,48918419,2015-09-29,29418709,Joanna,This was our first visit to Seattle and also first experience using Airbnb for accommodations. We arrived mid-afternoon and John was there to greet us.  The unit was clean and comfortable and just the right size for two or three people. 
4208555,50337591,2015-10-11,44526759,Anna,"I had a great stay in Alli and John's guest suite. It was easily accessible from I-5, and parking on their street was easy. The suite itself was clean and spacious and decorated nicely. 

The bedroom is a nice size, and the bed was really comfortable! The study/craft room was a great place to set up my laptop. There is a small kitchenette- a fridge, microwave, and coffee machine, as well as utensils and plates/cups/bowls/etc. The downside is that there is no sink in the kitchenette- you can either wash your dishes in the bathroom sink, which isn't too bad to do, or if you prefer, Alli and John can run your dishes through the dishwasher upstairs. 

The bathroom was clean and not cramped, and there was a nice large shower. There are various shampoos, conditioners, lotions, etc. available for your use, and a hair-dryer under the sink.

All of the rooms have separate baseboard heaters, so you get to control the temperature. There is also a pedestal fan in the bedroom, which is great if you're like me and need white noise to sleep.

Alli and John were very welcoming and conscientious, ready to help if I needed anything. "
4208555,51847585,2015-10-24,14898710,Molly,Nice place for the price! Would stay again! 
4208555,52015109,2015-10-25,32787869,Kate,"Great neighborhood and such a cute basement apartment! The place was spotless and I felt very welcome. Allison and John have nice touches that make the place feel like home, and there was ample space. I love how close the apartment was to several amenities, and we could even take a long run to the Green Lake area Saturday morning!"
4208555,53497150,2015-11-09,24301780,Stephanie,"We enjoyed our stay at Allison and John's...it was very spacious, and they provided everything we might need!  Laundry facilities, coffee, games, books, movies, toiletries.  It was easy to get around Seattle by bus from this location.  We never got to meet Allison and John, but they provided very complete information about the house and the area around it. There is a supermarket very close by. "
4208555,54191813,2015-11-16,245167,Lori,"The place was spotless and so cozy. It was the perfect launching point for a house-hunting trip of the neighborhood. There were loads of thoughtful touches: a guide to the area, bus route maps, plus coffee and oatmeal to kick off our day. One of my best airbnb experiences."
4208555,54494600,2015-11-20,3306707,Jennifer,"After needing to find a place at the last minute John and Allison interrupted their evening to make me feel welcome. This studio is perfect for a stay away from home. Kitchenette including thoughtful Pike Place brews,  comfortable, cozy sleeping and living spaces, nice outdoor (for warm weather) space as well. Plenty of street parking. Lots of food and coffee near by. "
4593740,24292509,2014-12-24,10558562,BreAnna,"Michelle's place was perfect. Clean, prepared, really nice and in an excellent location. She was a great host and was really gracious despite my late arrival. I hope to stay here again sometime."

4593740,26511876,2015-02-14,23114849,Cliff,"Shellie was very friendly, accommodating, and flexible. She allowed us to check-in much earlier than any hotel would. The space was comfortable and perfect for our Valentine's Day in Seattle. The rooftop view was breathtaking. We were also able to walk to all we wanted to see downtown in a day: Pikes Market, Great Wheel, Space Needle, Westlake Mall, CenturyLink/Safeco Area, Elliot Bay waterfront dinner. I recommend Shellie and I would definitely stay here again!"
4593740,26745664,2015-02-18,22383919,Prometheus,"My first airbnb experience with Shellie was great!  She answered promptly to all my questions I had prior to arriving and during my stay.  The apartment is as described and couldn't be in a better centralized location.  Overall, I loved the apartment and would definitely stay again when I visit.  "
4593740,26995903,2015-02-23,25699441,Danielle,Wonderful experience at Michelle's apartment. She was very flexible with letting us check in early and check out late. Great location in Downtown.

4593740,27951328,2015-03-15,21699747,Mallory,"We loved this Post apartment! It was in a fantastic location and easy to access the ferry station, Pike Place, public transit, etc. The apartment is modern, clean, and comfortable - it was ready for our stay! The rooftop is amazing (I wish we had a little more sun to enjoy it!). Thank you to Shellie for being accommodating, quick to respond to questions and incredibly kind before/during/after our stay."
4593740,28136753,2015-03-18,15730971,Julie,"We were looking for a central location and this loft was perfect in every way.  It was clean, quiet (on the 10th floor) and the bed was so comfortable.  The washer/dryer came in handy, too.  Don't miss the best views of Seattle and a beautiful sunset from the rooftop spaces in this building. Kerry Park is another great vantage point if traveling by car. Thank you Shellie for sharing your modern space with us and for keeping in contact via text. The detailed instructions were spot on. "
4593740,28268496,2015-03-21,12867745,Hilary,"Great experience! Clean, comfortable, and a great location! Shellie was so nice and welcoming. Would recommend to anyone! "

If I'd been staying longer, I would have found a reason to work from up there!  And even though I don't have a dog, the rooftop dog lounge/run was funny."
4593740,28883055,2015-03-31,5718603,Michael,"Perfect place for a Seattle experience! The building is beautiful, so very convenient to all that you would need and Shellie's apartment is very well appointed. We highly recommend the roof top - we spent each night there with a bottle of wine enjoying the view of the city.  Who needs the Space Needle when you have this at your fingertips!
Thanks Shellie for a great visit."
4593740,29926933,2015-04-14,8308525,Alison,"The apartment was immaculate and we had such a great stay.  It is just upstairs from a great coffee and donut shop and is an easy walk to both the ferries and Pike Place Market.  As others have said, the rooftop deck, which included interior entertainment space, had such a fantastic view.  We loved our stay.  We would definately stay here again on a future trip to Seattle."
4593740,30084266,2015-04-17,24478688,Jessica,Shellie was really easy to get a hold of and responded very quickly to any questions we had.  Her instructions were clear and detailed.

4593740,30136528,2015-04-18,13389749,Ashley,You can't beat this location! We walked to the Mariners game and had a blast! Beautiful home and Shellie was the perfect host!

4593740,30687709,2015-04-26,15928696,Matthew,"This place was very nice and in a wonderful location! The amenities in the apartment building were quite spectacular too. Shellie was the best Airbnb host I've had- she is very accessible, attentive, and went out of her way to make it an even better experience. I would stay there again in a heart beat- highly recommended.
One thing to note is that the bedroom is not completely private- it has one semi-open wall and one wall of sliding doors. Just good to know if you have a guest staying the night (on the wonderful fold-out couch included)."
4593740,30844245,2015-04-27,31770484,Aneth,Shellie was the perfect host. Her place was beautiful and the location was so close to everything. We went to a Mariners game before we checked in and then to a Sounders game after. She was unable to meet us but her friend Sage was kind enough to meet us for check in. He was more than happy to answer any questions we had and showed us all over the building. The apartment itself was well stocked and had more than enough space for us. We will definitely stay again!
4593740,31055119,2015-05-01,8879132,Jackson,This spot was perfect! Beautiful apartment with a comfy bed and I loved the rooftop view. The host was very communicative and it was easy to get the keys. Loved this place and will definitely try to stay here again.

This was our first time using Airbnb and we are 100% sold on the idea thanks to the wondering experience we had here. The apartment itself is beautiful and very secure. Couldn't have asked for more. 
4593740,32233513,2015-05-16,2781107,Marlon,"I great place to stay! Communication with Shellie was easy and check in / out went great. Apartment was nice and very clean. Bed was very comfortable and having a en suite  washer/dryer was a big plus. Building was very nice and safe. Another plus, a Top Pot Doughnuts right in the building! Yay! Great location, incredibly close to many bus lines and streetcars. Easy walk to Pike's Place Market, waterfront sculpture park, EMP, so many great places. Also only twenty minute walk to Capitol Hill and many delicious restaurants. Loved our time in apartment it was a great home base during our stay in Seattle. "
4593740,32784658,2015-05-21,5566462,Mathilde,"Shellie's apartment is great! It is in perfect proximity to the offices I needed to be, and a quick walk to great restaurants, museums, the waterfront, shopping, etc. The check-in/out process was seamless and easy. The building is new and has a 24-hour gym, rooftop area, and wifi. Everything felt clean and cozy, would definitely recommend staying here and will likely be a repeat booker :)"
4593740,33096776,2015-05-25,16795185,Karo,"Shellie was a great host! Very responsive during the entire process.  The unit was perfect for a couple, and a great location that is walking distance to lots of Seattle activities and a rooftop with a priceless view of the waterfront.  Everything was very comfortable and clean, it felt great getting back to the place after a day of exploring. Another plus the close proximity to the light rail station, recommended if you're coming in from SeaTac. Overall a great experience that made the visit to Seattle that much better!"
4593740,33577268,2015-05-30,5077148,Reg&Fran,Communication with host timely and effective. The apt clean and appointed as listed and well located with easy access to major attractions. Roof space added attraction. Highly recommended.
4593740,33973876,2015-06-02,32283630,Ryan,Easy going and once again an enjoyable experience! Beautiful place close to the Puget Sound.. Thank you
4593740,34649524,2015-06-10,27339176,Harold,"The condo was everything promised. Comfortable, quiet, and all the necessities and supplies that you would expect to be waiting for you at a quality hotel and all the conveniences of home. The rooftop view was all that everyone has said it is. And such a peaceful place to sit out in the evening, to see the ships going by and to watch the sunset, a place to cook out if you would want that. A great location to enjoy the major Seattle visitor sites at walking distance. We had no need for a car. Enjoyed walking to everything, including top notch nearby restaurants. Shellie arranged for a good friend to greet us, orient us to the sites in Seattle, and welcome us to this lovely condo. Easy taxi ride from and to SEA. When we return to Seattle, we will look to stay here again. Thank you Shellie and Rahn."
4593740,34931411,2015-06-14,25477107,Natalia,Michelle was great about communicating everything we needed until the first day of our stay - we felt organized and secure going into our trip and were excited about the location and proximity of the unit. Rhan was great by letting us know the greatest places to visit and what was near by. Both Michelle and Rhan were very flexible with our schedules too! Accomodations were great as well.
4593740,35314701,2015-06-17,235494,Katherine,"Shellie's downtown apartment is in a very convenient central location.  Easy access to all mode of public transportation and ferry terminal to Bainbridge Island. The roof top garden, club room, fitness center and business center are definitely a plus!  Great views of the city and the bay from the top. 
Shellie is very accommodating to our request to check in our luggage early since we arrived on a morning flight.  She was unable to meet us on our arrival.  Instead, she had her friend meet us at the apartment and gave us directions and great recommendations on local restaurants and sights.  I would recommend Shellie's place to my friends when they visit Seattle."
4593740,35453023,2015-06-19,27502586,Devin,"Location was amazing; perfect for walking to the stadiums. The rooftop was AWESOME. Great for hanging out, having drinks, and taking in the beautiful view. Apartment was clean and spacious, perfect for 2 people. Not great for a third person since the bedroom has open walls to the living room and therefore no privacy. Check-in was easy and Rahn was incredibly friendly and had helpful recommendations. He was also available at any time to answer any questions via text. We were given access to the parking garage but did not have a guest pass (like we saw on some cars in there) and ended up getting a parking ticket. Host said they would take care of it- so all good! Will definitely stay again if we come up to Seattle for some Mariner/Seahawk games! Thank you!!"
4593740,36376914,2015-06-28,30743250,Dena,"My husband,  Mike & I stayed in Shellie ' s Apartment in Seattle.  The place is comfortable, neat and clean.  We were so impressed with the roof - top deck.   Was a great location in downtown Seattle.   Walking around was easy.  Shellie is a Fantastic Host!  Her communications were quick and clear.   We hope to rent this same place again sometime from Shellie.  Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle!  ☆☆☆☆"
4593740,36797437,2015-07-01,12929752,Johann,"One of my favorite Airbnb experiences to date!  The apartment is beautiful, roomy, air-conditioned (a plus for Seattle in the summer) and very conveniently close to Pioneer Square and all of downtown.  The staff in the building were helpful and courteous and the rooftop views an absolute must, unspoiled by cranes or construction as it is so close to Elliot Bay.  We slept two people on the couch and it was a very comfortable, firm support - better than many beds on this site.  Shellie was great at communicating and a very gracious host.  I couldn't recommend this place highly enough - while it was fun to explore Seattle, the favorite part of the day was unwinding with cocktails and wine on the rooftop, watching the sun set over the olympic mountains.  World-class accommodation - thank you for everything Shellie!"
4593740,36965584,2015-07-03,33872887,Veronica,"We loved this place! Comfortable, homey - it was the place we wanted to hang out in despite our busy stay in Seattle. Will definitely be reserving this home again! Shellie was more than accomadating with anything we needed from a parking spot to the local good eats. "
4593740,37285050,2015-07-06,13443980,Kathy,The apartment was clean and lovely inside. Great location. Shellie and Rohn were great hosts- friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. 
4593740,37703743,2015-07-09,20036697,Lorraine,Wonderful location and beautiful place! Comfy beds. Great rooftop views and gym.  We walked everywhere.  Would recommend this place to everyone and we'll be back.  Thanks Rahn for your hospitality!
4593740,39157247,2015-07-21,14394381,Oleg,"Представитель хозяйки Rahn гостеприимно встретил нас и передал ключи о квартиры и пуль от подъезда. Квартира находится в отличном месте, очень комфортная и соответсвует описанию."
4593740,39728550,2015-07-26,6228847,Nadia,"The building was fantastic. The rootop ammenities were a lovely added extra (although there was no access to the gym). The apartment itself is also lovely and was very clean and just as it looks in the pictures. And the location is great, within walking distance of most touristy spots. 

There was however a only basic cutlery in the kitchen. We had wanted to cook and bbq food we had brought from Pike Place but weren't able to do so due to the limited kitchen ammenities. 

Also our train come in in the early evening which meant we had to pick up up the apartment keys from another building a few blocks. Shellie did give us really good instructions on how to get there but it was slightly inconvenient so I would definitely suggest getting there as close to the check in time as possible.

Overall we had a great stay and Shellie was very helpful and could be reached whenever necessary. We would definitely stay again .

"
4593740,40329562,2015-07-30,34543295,Emily,"This apartment was awesome, Shellie was communicative and helpful and Rahn (who dropped off the keys to us) was informative and great. 
The place was clean, bright, and comfortable. The building itself is amazing; there is rooftop lounge with an incredible view and a room with a pool table, shuffleboard and a big screen TV. Seriously, the roof is fantastic. 
The place is also centrally located; it's extremely easy to get around and close to almost anywhere you'd want to go. 
I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in the area and highly recommend. 
"
4593740,40560596,2015-08-01,13578810,Roger,Great place to stay.  Within walking distance of downtown which is exactly what we were looking for.  Shellie was a great host and once introduced to the property left us us to enjoy our stay.
4593740,41099034,2015-08-04,30658096,Andrea,"The apartment was super clean and included everything we needed.  Shellie was accommodating with our arrival time (which kept being pushed back), and the apartment includes so many amenities!!"
4593740,41573975,2015-08-08,5979948,Neil,Shellie has an amazing place that is well located in the city. It's an easy walk to everything. Very Clean and spacious apartment. I know where I will be staying if I'm ever in Seattle again! Thank you :)
4593740,41731255,2015-08-09,30244408,Kara,"Shellie was such a sweet person and was extremely accommodating from the moment I booked! She made my visit very pleasant and stress free. I enjoyed the place so much! Such a spacious and cozy place in a great location! Very easy access to everything in the city. The roof top lounge was a wonderful bonus! If you ever visit Seattle, I highly recommend booking this room with Shellie!"
4593740,42137629,2015-08-11,29408819,Sabrina,"Shellie has been so accommodating throughout the duration of my trip. My friend and I weren't able to book for 4 nights so she had arranged the other 2 nights with her sister's listing in the same building. It was extremely kind of her and she made it convenient for us to move. The room itself is gorgeous. Modern, clean and spacious for two. The building's amenities were amazing! The rooftop view was so relaxing and enjoyable at night. Such a great area to be in for the week. Just a few minutes away from Pike Place and definitely in a safe area to roam around in at night. Thanks again, Shellie. You were really too kind to us!"
4593740,43048050,2015-08-17,12289743,Gail,Wonderful location and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
4593740,43382662,2015-08-19,7627259,Paula,"I had a great time at the condo. An amazing location close to everything, with free parking. Rahn was very kind, informative and made my experience extremely comfortable. I definitely recommend this condo and would stay here again. The rooftop sunset was unforgettable!!!"
4593740,43770377,2015-08-22,16758650,Suzie,"Location was AMAZING. We were central and the rooftop view of Seattle was breath taking. Shellie could not meet us but she set something up and our accommodation was fantastic. The place was clean, clean towels, a great tour of the apartment as well as lots of foodie suggestions and tours set out on the coffee table. Shellie communicated very well. Our stay was great! I'd definitely book again."
4593740,44365344,2015-08-25,41476638,Elizabeth,"This Seattle trip was one of my favorites and staying at Shellie's made our experience that much more pleasurable... From the gorgeous views the apartment had to offer to the lounges available to us on the roof top.  My husband and I spent the late evenings there (rooftop) where we mingled a little with others and also privately enjoyed the city views on our own.  The apartment was walking distance from everything, making all of Seattle's highlights accessible.  Pioneer Square, the Waterfront and of course the famous Pike Place Market were short strolls away. Just less than a five minute walk led us to the ferry making Bainbridge and Bremerton an added bonus to our trip. Thank you Shellie for your hospitality! Much appreciated. "
4593740,45367913,2015-09-02,18073353,Nicholas,The apartment was beautiful and well placed in the city as my team and I had to commute on foot to the convention center for work during out stay. Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. 
4593740,45565394,2015-09-04,28862824,Amanda,Great location and very comfortable! You can walk all over downtown Seattle from here. The place is exactly as described in a secure building. Check in was smooth and easy and we really enjoyed our stay.  The rooftop is amazing and not to be missed. The location cannot be beat!!!!!
4593740,45921445,2015-09-07,7764807,Tim,"The description provided was perfectly accurate, the location ideal, and the living space clean & comfortable.  Would recommend this lodging option to anyone!"
4593740,46575088,2015-09-12,12738196,John,"The host made us feel very welcome. the place was nice, clean, and as described.  Shellie was not available but make arrangements for someone to meet us when we arrived and left.  the location was perfect.  closely accessible to everything downtown."
4593740,47040457,2015-09-15,11670647,Lanny,"My wife and I could not have asked for a better location than the one Shellie provided.  We were able to walk everywhere in the downtown area, including a nice walk to catch a baseball game.  The rooftop game room and deck area were spectacular.  A provided parking spot in the buildings garage was very convenient, even though we only used the car once out of the three days we stayed.  When we decide to travel to Seattle again, I will definitely look up this place again."
4593740,47283347,2015-09-17,20492797,Gary,Modern apartment that was kept clean and nice with the secure entry.
4593740,48873437,2015-09-29,32938659,Grant,"Our first trip to Seattle wouldn't have been nearly the experience hadn't we stayed at this fantastic apartment. It's very clean and modern. It's a quick walk to both the market and the stadiums. However, the best part is the rooftop. It offers some of the best views of the city and has a great fitness room and entertaining areas. I would definitely recommend to anyone. "
4593740,49459991,2015-10-04,772102,Connie,"My daughter and I stayed at Shellie's apt for my son's wedding. We had a wonderful time and loved staying at this apt. The location was great! One the second day I discovered Top Pot Doughnuts in the same building. Parking in the building was safe and convenient. There is a washer/dryer and lots of room. Shellie was a great host. She responded promptly to my emails and was very accommodating. 
I would definitely stay here again. "
4593740,50573784,2015-10-12,35668875,David,"Very clean and modern place at a great price. Close to Pioneer Square, the light rail, and the waterfront. "
4593740,50849398,2015-10-15,8375392,Julia,"Shellie was an excellent host. The apartment was well-stocked with the essentials and clean. Any requests or questions I had were addressed promptly.

The location is fantastic.

Overall, 10/10:"
4593740,51148707,2015-10-18,21151613,Patrick,"The whole experience with Shellie was a pleasure. The unit was immaculate and the check in was prompt and courteous. I would highly recommend staying at the Post in Seattle, it is Seattle's finest building in the best location there is in the city. And Shellie's unit is the perfect accompaniment to an unforgettable world class Seattle experience!"
4593740,51478293,2015-10-20,45245008,Victoria,Loved this apt!! Perfect place and location to stay at when visiting Seattle! Shellie was such a great host and very helpful. Hope to stay here again  :)
4593740,52106602,2015-10-26,39177911,Jasmin,The apartment was amazing and was very close to everything that we wanted to visit. We walked to most places or took uber if it was further away. But overall the room was super comfortable and and the view from the rooftop was amazing do definitely take advantage of it.
4593740,52605112,2015-10-31,45379120,Frank,"Shellie offers a delightful place in downtown Seattle. It is a true gem in terms of walkability, we didn't use the car the entire stay. Also very conveniently she offers a private parking space in s secured location, gym/yoga access, and a rooftop lounge with spectacular panoramic views. We didn't get to meet Shellie, but Don was extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend renting this unit and would stay here again. "
4593740,53520978,2015-11-09,46473937,Heather,Shellie was a great host.  She was responsive to all of my questions and her place was exactly as advertised.  Don met us and was kind and helpful.  He even offered to carry our bags!  We would definitely stay here again.  The location was amazing and the rooftop area cannot be beat.
4593740,53667675,2015-11-10,790807,C,"Apartment was clean and simple and quiet, with a few basic cooking items. Communication was quick and easy, Don checked us in and was super helpful and accommodating. Let us in a little early so our baby could nap which we really appreciated. Overlooks The Owl and Thistle, a good  irish pub, a dive but charming in its own way. Rooftop terrace is under construction so no access, but the indoor lounge area has amazing views. Only bummer was no coffee. Overall a good 1 night stay, though for the price, you can find a place with coffee and a better view."
4593740,53988192,2015-11-15,13204052,John,What a great apartment. Close to pike place market and some great restaurants. Shellie was an excellent host and made sure we had access to everything we needed while in Seattle. I would 100% use Shellie's apartment again while in Seattle. 
4593740,54467618,2015-11-20,33693539,Dave,"Shellie was fabulous and very welcoming. Her apartment was clean, tidy, quiet and comfortable. Location was superb. I would certainly return without hesitation. Thank you!"
4593740,54565612,2015-11-21,39739494,Aaron,Apartment was clean and had a great location. Would stay again. 
4593740,55032962,2015-11-27,24019884,Bulat,"Although the host was not there, her friend was able to meet us and shows the apartment complex. The building is neatly located in close proximity to many popular places in Seattle. The neighborhood is quite and peaceful. "
4593740,55214605,2015-11-29,41433256,Heidi,"98 walk score is well deserved. This place is perfectly placed for quick access to the piers, pike place market and the ball fields. Parking is just a 1/2 block away. We really enjoyed our stay. The views from the roof are terrific on a clear day, and the game room was fun. As this is an open concept apartment, if you're a light sleeper, bring along some ear plugs to wear. :-)"
4593740,55845175,2015-12-06,48176035,Corey,"We had an absolute blast at Shellie's place!  It's in a great location between the stadiums and Pike St.  I would recommend for any couple.  One thing I did not notice in the listing - The bedroom is not enclosed and private, just something to keep in mind if you're dragging a third wheel around! :)"
4593740,57219315,2015-12-23,23480507,Cate,"Apartment is lovely, and fantastic location. There's a great gym on the roof and a cool space to hang out too. I had a great stay here and absolutely recommend it if you're looking for a cool place to stay in downtown Seattle!"
4593740,57875349,2015-12-30,39531262,Kathy,"It was a great location, close to stadium, shopping and cultural attractions.  The post has nice amenities like a workout room and outdoor balcony that was really nice. Getting the key and leaving the key very easy.  Everything was great except the furniture including the bed and pillows were not comfortable and for that reason I would not suggest this listing to a friend. I love the post just not this particular apt. Sorry."
4593740,58362985,2016-01-02,50077364,Natasha,"Shellie arrived on time to meet us in the parking garage down the block and specially came to meet us during the work day which we appreciated. Upon getting settled in we realized that the kitchen was barely useable. There aren't actual cooking utensils to use so my plans to cook one night ended up not happening. The bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows definitely leave much to be desired so bring your own if you're picky. The shower head was extremely low pressure, and the towels in the bathroom were wet when we arrived. There is cable but no HD or DVR services, so that was a letdown as well. The actual building was great and had a nice location...but overall I wouldn't stay here again."
6956938,36480297,2015-06-28,16401627,Sarah,The Studio is spotless and equipped with everything needed for a pleasant stay.  I'm a West Seattle native so the location is perfect for visiting family but also very convenient to downtown.  Only 12 minutes to the yoga studio I frequent in Queen Anne.  Great view of Downtown and Space Needle.  Very quiet.  Mumtaz is the perfect host.  Will be back.  
6956938,36833465,2015-07-01,16401627,Sarah,"If you want to live like a Seattle-ite, rent the Studio on the Green.  10 minutes from downtown and all the popular tourist sites, 10 minutes from the best beach in the state, Alki.  Very chill neighborhood with wonderful food options.  Check out Ma'ono or Marination Mai Kai.  Happy hour at Salty's.  Or pick up dinner at the Metropolitan Market, 3 short blocks away.  
The Studio has a full kitchen, comfy bed, cable TV, wi-fi, laundry, and the best host, Mumtaz"
6956938,37247027,2015-07-05,16401627,Sarah,"The Studio on the Green is a welcome oasis.  Tucked into a very quiet West Seattle neighborhood, it is also walking distance from a delicious pizza place, Pizzeria 22, as well as numerous other restaurants, 2 grocery stores, a movie theater, hair salons, florists, great coffee at Cafe Fiore.  Mumtaz is a thoughtful host and I am enjoying this home away from home.  Will definitely be back.  "
6956938,37616445,2015-07-08,16401627,Sarah,"I had wonderful stay at the Studio.  Mumtaz is the perfect host.  She left me to myself,checking in periodically to make sure I had everything I needed.  Will be back.  "
6956938,38748108,2015-07-18,36535556,Andrew,"The location of the home is perfect and accommodations are amazing! The view of the Space Needle from the home are amazing! I was a little concerned at first about parking away from the home, but it was not an issue. The neighborhood is extremely safe and I felt comfortable leaving my car any where within in a short walk! The hosts make themselves available for any needs and are extremely helpful! This was an ideal transition accommodation for me as I made my move to Seattle!!"
6956938,39135010,2015-07-20,34139753,Getty,"Little below average experience: Wonderful listing, great location and exactly what is posted.  Once I received the keys until I left, it was a great experience.

Sadly though I didn't get the keys on the first night, this is a peer to peer service where the host is expected to be near their phone and act kind of like a business.  I was on vacation and plans changed a little bit (communicated a 3PM key drop off prior to that day), texted around 10 AM about needing a different time.  I received a call at 5-7PM to work on when to key exchange.  By then I had already made accommodations elsewhere (after 5 hours you have to find another place if your hotel doesn't answer), didn't receive a refund.  Sunk cost is expected at times with P2P services though.

The host is a little new to this experience though, so I'm just writing this off as a learning experience for her.  I had budgeted a few $100 more for the trip, it's unfortunate to spend it without getting anything in return.

Oh and curtains are needed, that view is great...but at 7AM, it's pretty bright in there.  Good if you need to make a meeting, not great for a vacation.

I'd stay again in 3-6 months when they get a little more experience and just make sure that I'm not on a flexible vacation where I would need to communicate."
6956938,39436497,2015-07-23,33593660,Anne,We enjoyed our stay here.  The studio was clean and pleasant.  It was easy and fun to take the ferry and shuttle to downtown Seattle.  Our hosts were pleasant and helpful and respected our privacy.
6956938,39965765,2015-07-27,8138741,Nick,"We arrived and ran into Mumtaz right as she was heading out for the day - perfect timing! She gave us a key and made us feel very welcome; she even dropped my girlfriend and I off at a bus stop so we could easily catch the water taxi to the ferry. Everything about our stay here was wonderful, the view of the space needle was amazing,  and we can't wait to come back!"
6956938,40289968,2015-07-29,19387667,Pilar,This studio apartment is absolutely perfect!!! Very bright with a view of the Space Needle. Thank you!
6956938,40398101,2015-07-30,5694365,Arash,"Although we arrived late at night, Mumtaz was waiting with a warm smile and some friendly advice on where to grab some late night dinner. The suite was very private, incredibly clean and had a spectacular view. The amount of windows and sunlight in the suite was beautiful; however, it was quite bright very early in the morning so some curtains or blinds may be a nice addition to the place. Overall, a wonderful experience in a very quiet, beautiful home !!"
6956938,40550429,2015-07-31,37323360,Dave,"The place was great and clean.  Nice view and private. There are some steep stairs to climb up and down, something to consider for the folks who might have a harder time getting around. But the setting and view are well worth the couple dozen steps!"
6956938,41246720,2015-08-05,31820048,Peter,Mumtaz is an awesome host. We had great time while staying in the studio. It's quiet private very clean and with an amazing view of Seattle. West Seattle off Admiral way is a very convenient and beautiful place to stay when visiting Seattle. There's a 5 minute walk to the free shuttle that's takes you to the $4.25 ferry to downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay here again. 
6956938,41469927,2015-08-07,21250748,Tommy,"I felt very welcome, the instructions were clear on where to park and how to get the keys. The apartment was exactly as advertised, and the view was even better than the pictures made it look. Thanks Mumtaz!"
6956938,42416507,2015-08-13,10535170,Amanda,"We had a wonderful time staying in Muntaz's studio. The location was perfect- quiet and secluded and a nice retreat from the city. The studio was cozy and accommodating, everything we could have needed was provided and more! Mumtaz and her husband are lovely people. We enjoyed chatting with them and hearing their recommendations of things to do around West Seattle. We would definitely recommend their place to friends traveling to the area. "
6956938,42637200,2015-08-14,7459702,Katherine,"Wonderful stay - lovely hostess and space.  My plans shifted last minute in regards to my arrival time and Mumtaz ensured I was able to access the studio and settle in.  The space is truly charming and although I did not meet with my hostess, she was professional, communicative, and provided straight forward instructions on the home, etc.  She thought of every last detail!  I would definitely stay here again."
6956938,43851393,2015-08-22,40729561,Karen,"For anyone that is afraid this stay might be too removed from the city, don't be. It was nice to stay in West Seattle. This home is very beautiful, clean, and located in a quiet neighborhood with cool restaurants, bars, and stores a few blocks away. Mumtaz and Abdul  kept great communication throughout my trip. Thank you for sharing your home with me. "
6956938,45043972,2015-08-30,2845647,Chelsea,Mumtaz was a great host. We really enjoyed our stay in Beautiful Seattle. Great location and view of the city. We would love to stay again when we go back! 
6956938,46322686,2015-09-09,3355312,Ashley,"Mumtaz's studio was a great place for my stay in West Seattle - I was there for work and the location was super convenient. Mumtaz was very friendly and quick to respond to any messages, coordinating check in was a breeze. The studio itself is a little sparse and can get cold with all the windows (there is a heater in the closet!) but all the basics were present and I would definitely stay here again.   "
6956938,47099199,2015-09-15,2934430,Laura,"The location of this studio is absolutely perfect for anyone interested in exploring in West Seattle, with easy access via ferry or taxi to downtown Seattle. Mumtaz and her husband were excellent hosts, making us feel welcome and checking in to make sure that we had everything we needed. We loved having so much within walking distance, including restaurants and grocery stores. The studio is very quiet and we enjoyed hearing the seals in the harbor. I also got in several runs from the studio with epic views of Seattle. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! 

PS I didn't think to pack a hairdryer, but one is not provided on-site. Otherwise, we were delighted to find other essentials waiting for us there. "
6956938,48239476,2015-09-24,2767232,Julia,"Mumtaz's studio is really conveniently located by a few grocery stores and banks, but completely tucked away, too.  It's totally private - you can't see any other houses from the windows, but you can see the water and peaks of the downtown Seattle skyline.

Mumtaz was communicative with me throughout the whole check-in and check-out process.  During a day while I was out, Mumtaz needed to bring in a repair man to change the blinds, and asked for my permission first.  By my request, she tucked a couple of my valuables out of plain sight, but she also waited around during the process to assure me that all of my things would be safe - and they were. "
6956938,48590639,2015-09-27,21066515,Eric,"Mumtaz was a great host, friendly and welcoming. The unit was nice and large and it was great to have a full kitchen. 

The location was perfect, West Seattle is a great place to relax while still having access to Seattle's downtown. "
6956938,50946104,2015-10-16,42158247,Michael,Mumtaz was a great host and very accommodating.  This studio is in a great location that is very walkable and there is also ample street parking.  The unit is basically brand new and it was spotless when we arrived.  You can smell the ocean from the deck and hear harbor seals from the kitchen.  
6956938,51573173,2015-10-21,46025992,Michelle,"We enjoyed our stay in West Seattle, it's still somewhat of a hidden charm & only 10 minutes from downtown Seattle. We especially loved hearing the harbor seals. Thank you so much Mumtaz & Abdul! Your location is superb!!"
6836330,37500735,2015-07-07,12421265,Liz,"My partner and I arrived on a holiday weekend and Becky & Len weren't home but left the keys in a safe place. We actually stayed in the Tiny Sugar Shack trailer parked in the driveway, which was quite cute. It is a little colorful trailer they drove cross-country in from MA. We were allowed in the main house which had the bathroom. The main house was also quite lovely. Overall, would definitely stay here again. Becky has nice taste and the house is in Ballard, which is a wonderful neighborhood. Not a LOT of places are in walking distance, but we had a rental car which we could get around in. "
6836330,38305004,2015-07-14,36087749,Phoebe,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Ballard!  This home is cozy & the owner is in the process of remodeling it.  Many updates are yet to be made, but it is quite liveable at the present.  The location gets a thumbs up for walkability!  We were able to walk to our son's apartment, restaurants, breweries, coffeeshops and the farmer's market.  Our stay also coincided with the annual Seafoodfest!

We initially had problems with the Wifi codes provided, but did get that resolved.  Interestingly, we learned during these communications that the owner was actually in the midst of her own wedding preparations!  She got married the weekend we were in her home!    

We would definitely return if this home is available the next time we visit! "
6836330,44213764,2015-08-24,41208518,Bo,"Great quiet neighborhood, house was just as described. Becky was great and extremely fast at communicating. She left us a cute welcome note and much needed instructions on the coffee maker! The gypsy trailer was awesome, a definite added bonus! I would definitely stay here again!"
6836330,45123455,2015-08-31,3760656,Doug,"Becky was a fantastic host. Great communication, went out of her way to make sure our group had everything we needed. The location was a short walk to the heart of Ballard (about 15 min walk) and was perfect for a weekend of exploring Seattle's north end. "
6836330,46168474,2015-09-08,30810054,Wency,"Becky's house is comfy, super adorable, and artfully decorated. There's a park nearby in this quiet residential neighbourhood and the zoo's within walking distance (about 30-40 mins on foot), which was perfect for us as we were travelling with a toddler. Becky's two cats were really cute and no trouble to care for, but sharing the space with pets may not be ideal for anyone who has allergies or isn't a cat person. "
6836330,58649269,2016-01-03,51220265,Aly,"The listing is exactly as advertised - very cozy little home, quiet neighborhood, adorable kitties. We really appreciated the extra heater in the bathroom and the coffee/tea and granola for us in the morning! Nice comfy bed, and an overall great experience. 

The house is a little far from anything - at least we weren't able to find groceries or anything close by, although we weren't there for very long, and this didn't really affect our stay.

2284536,10561379,2014-02-24,5959778,Marie-Elizabeth,Wonderful stay at Rob and Molly' house. Everything was super clean and well furnished. It was a lovely stay and we would recommend the place to anybody that is looking to spend a few days/weeks in Seattle.
2284536,10668727,2014-03-02,12426821,Steven,Stayed here while some work was being done at my place. Rob and Molly are super nice. The place is nice and clean. Quiet neighborhood with easy driving access to a lot of things.
2284536,10768155,2014-03-06,44511,V,"Excellent communication.  Super clean space to chill for a few days before we made our way into the wilderness of Olympic State Park.  Ballard is a cool town and we enjoyed the Sunday farmer's market.  Though the downtown area is within walking distance, we found the hike in the cold and rain to be a bit arduous (weak Floridians!) so on the last day we rented a car.  Free parking outside.  Do yourself a favor and walk up the hill: on a clear day, the view is amazing!  Rob and Molly are super kind and courteous hosts.  Thanks for the coffee!!"

Very comfortable, clean and conveniently located. The home was well stocked. It was like a home away from home. Rob was a very accommodating and pleasant host. He was quite attentive and made sure any needs were promptly met. The location was ideal. Ballard is a great town to walk around in the big City of Seattle. In addition, the duplex was on a main bus route to downtown Seattle. I only wish we had more time to stay there. 
Very highly recommended.

2284536,11094937,2014-03-20,1558385,Jessica,"My family and I had a fantastic stay at Rob and Molly's place.  We got the baby/toddler package, which was super convenient - no need to find a pack and play, lug a stroller cross-country or pack an extra suitcase for our son's books and toys! The Ballard cottage was cozy, clean and conveniently located. The well-stocked kitchen, quiet bedroom, and a great radio made our stay comfortable and relaxing. Thanks for the kid-friendly restaurant rec - we had a great meal at The Phinney Market!"
2284536,11221441,2014-03-25,3587791,Bert & David,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Rob and Molly's place in Ballard and had a very good stay. The house is very cute and clean and has a great location and is close proximity to shopping, restaurants and other neighborhoods. 

We'd recommend to anyone coming to Seattle and is looking to get a feel for what it be like to be a local! "
2284536,11303986,2014-03-29,12484875,Kurt,"We loved the location of Rob and Molly's place.  In a residential area with easy parking, the apartment is centrally located between three great Seattle neighborhoods (Ballard, Freemont, and Phinney Ridge).  It's also only ten minutes by car to downtown across the Ballard or 99 bridge.  We didn't use public transportation, but there seemed to be bus stops less than a block away.  The apartment itself is simply furnished with a hip, thrift store style.  We were able to sleep four, with our teenage daughters using an inflatable mattress in the living room.  Check-out and check-in was simple.  Overall, a great experience and a good value for a traveling family.  Thanks Rob and Molly.  If we visit Seattle again, you'll be our first choice for accommodations. "
2284536,11361191,2014-03-31,1955258,Leslie,"We really enjoyed our weekend at Rob & Molly's cozy Ballard cottage! Great location, amenities & easy communication with our hosts."
2284536,11451895,2014-04-03,3180468,Obol,What a great stay in beautiful Seattle! The house was clean and perfect for my husband and myself. Just a short walk to downtown Ballard and goodwill! I would definitely stay again!
2284536,11555943,2014-04-07,4047723,Phill,"Had an amazing time at Rob and Molly's place. Ballard and Phinney are really great neighborhoods to hang out in, R& M's place is super comfortable and well located. We were able to walk to lots of restaurants and shopping."
2284536,11726858,2014-04-13,13777342,John,"The Ballard neighborhood in Seattle has pleasant, quiet streets, and it is reasonably accessible to major thoroughfares that connect to the rest of the city. If you want a discreetly managed place to stay, this may be your best bet.  It is a separate cottage down the street from the proprietors (Rob and Molly) who keep the premises neat and clean and provide the basics to make your own breakfast (i.e. coffee, a grinder, and a good French press). You may even find a locally brewed beer in the refrigerator. Rob and Molly are helpful with directions and such, if needed.  If not, they stay out of your way.  Their cottage was well suited to my needs, and I enjoyed my stay. "
2284536,11858557,2014-04-17,3499201,Doug,Loved it! Great retro decor. Really liked the old school radio. Friendly & helpful hosts. Easy Parking. Close to Ballard shops & restaurants. Ballard Market was just a few blocks away. Slate coffee and Veraci Pizza extremely close and fantastic. Tried to eat a slice of Veraci pizza each day - didn't quite work out. 
2284536,12151711,2014-04-24,8494242,Amy,"We stayed here during our move back to Seattle, and it was a great landing spot for North Seattle.  There is a downtown bus (#28) right out front that also takes you to downtown Fremont, or the #44 bus takes you to downtown Ballard or, in the other direction, Wallingford and the University District. 

The house was nicely decorated and had enough amenities for our week-long stay.  Good wifi, a kettle, and a toaster are all we really need, but the house also has a washer/dryer, kitchen utensils for making a meal at home (but why would you when you're so close to all the good things Ballard and Fremont have to offer?), and magazines and books for perusing.  "
2284536,12713663,2014-05-09,8330143,Lara,"We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard. It was a perfect neighborhood for our young family, very walkable, and close to public transportation. We found the house to be very charming and accommodating for our week stay. We used the air mattress provided, could not find it right away, and I called Rob with a really quick response and he was willing to come over to help if needed. Thanks for a wonderful place to call home for a week."
2284536,13077225,2014-05-19,4078877,Henry,"Cheerful, clean space in a great location. We especially liked the cool books and retro decor. Very convenient to some of Seattle's coolest neighborhoods (Fremont, Ballard, Wallingford, Green Lake and the U district). Highly recommend this place!"
2284536,13243039,2014-05-23,13718511,Star,"Rob and Molly responded promptly to all of our communications. They gave suggestions for places to visit in Seattle and were available if we needed anything. (Thank you!)

The duplex was exactly what we expected. It really looks like the photos and description! And it's very eco friendly = seventh generation cleaning products. 

The neighborhood is definitely a neighborhood. There was a bit more traffic on the street than we expected (less traffic at night) but don't worry about it unless you are super sensitive to noise. There's a great pizza place (Veraci Pizza) a couple of blocks from the apartment and many more restaurants and shops a couple of blocks in the other direction.

We ended up spending most of our time in downtown Seattle and near the Space Needle (EMP and Chihuly museums are amazing). The apartment was surprisingly close to the Space needle (10-15 min by car). I'm pretty sure there are buses that go downtown as well. 

Things we loved!
the closet space
the vintage decor, glassware, shower and kitchen tiles
how close it is to Seattle Space needle/downtown
free wifi
free beer
parking in front of the apartment"

The bed wasn't too comfortable, which was a bummer, and kind of loud when you turn in bed."
2284536,13874543,2014-06-07,12963989,Dermot,"We were very happy during our stay in Seattle. 
Rob and Molly's cottage is ideally located in a nice, quiet neighborhood; 
Close to downtown Ballard, with a great selection of restaurants and its fantastic farmer's market.
Excellent response time from Rob to all correspondence.

2284536,14597927,2014-06-23,11462505,Molli,"Lovely experience, this home truly had ""vintage Ballard charm"". In a city that has grown tighter and tighter it was nice to have a landing spot with some elbow room and a sense of ""home"". We were able to park right in front every time. The space met  and exceeded all of our needs and expectations. We were very grateful for the washer and dryer downstairs. Everything we needed was there or accessible nearby. Our girls camped out in the living room on the queen size air bed and enjoyed watching the world go by out the tree shaded front window. The bedroom was quiet and the firm mattress was perfect for our road weary backs. If we ever get back out to Seattle, we would definitely stay here again. "
2284536,14817159,2014-06-27,14385281,Courtney,"We enjoyed our stay in your ""Vintage Ballard Charm"". Bright and clean. A perfect home away from home."
2284536,15441807,2014-07-09,737221,Kendra,Wonderful vacation. Very prompt response to any questions I had. The house was clean and super comfortable. We will definitely stay here on our next Seattle trip!
2284536,15908618,2014-07-18,15203194,Shari,A good stay. A few items were needed and they brought them right over.  The house was clean and cute. Everything worked well especially the kitchen. The location was great for walks and shopping. Ballard is fun.
2284536,16068814,2014-07-21,15693585,Stephanie,We had a great stay at this place! Everything was in place and clean when we arrived. Good location for getting to downtown and to other family events to the north.  We walked to a couple of local restaurants that were pretty tasty.  Nice neighborhood for walking.  The decorative touches were great! 
2284536,16203409,2014-07-23,2760621,Lily,"Great little house, close-in location! Sweet hosts left coffee and beer for us!"
2284536,16542822,2014-07-29,5293406,Kim,"We enjoyed our stay at Molly and Rob's place during our time in Seattle. They set us up with some beers in the fridge and great coffee beans from Caffe Vita which was an added bonus. One thing to note is that this place is a duplex and not a detached home. We didn't realize this, but the neighbor was super quiet and it didn't pose any problems. Just an FYI. The location in Ballard is great because it's in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle and within walking/biking distance to tons of great restaurants, bars, shops and coffee places. "
2284536,16763630,2014-08-02,13230495,Nancy,The Vintage Ballard was an older home that completely served our purpose during a recent trip to Seattle. It ha a washer and dryer and a complete kitchen.
2284536,17157426,2014-08-08,16310878,Bruce,"We enjoyed our stay. It definitely had 'vintage charm' with classic magazines, dishes, furniture etc. The neighborhood is great with lots of food and beer close by. Free parking also saved us a lot of money as Seattle parking can be expensive in certain areas.  Our guest got to the airport in just over 1 hour on one bus and one train. The coffee and beer left for us was also greatly enjoyed."
2284536,17363511,2014-08-11,16178738,Paul,"We had a very pleasant time. The house is very charming and we felt at home right away. As a bonus, the bus stop to go downtown is close by."
2284536,18703811,2014-08-31,7606508,Tim,"Rob and Molly were very responsive and friendly. We happened to arrive during one of Seattle's few hot spells, and they even offered to track down an extra fan for us to make things more comfortable. As for the location and unit itself, the bed and pillows were a bit hard and the bed had a dent in the middle, and the street was a little busy (though with the windows closed traffic noise wasn't much of an issue). "
2284536,18877474,2014-09-02,16627663,Rachel,Cute place in an excellent location to get around the city. The coffee and beer are a nice added touch. Rob and Molly were very accomodating when we had to leave earlier than expected. 
2284536,19418976,2014-09-12,19628788,Lee,"Besides the cozy bed with fluffy down duvet, lots of closet space and nice green products (we really appreciated), the bungalow was light, pleasant, simply and artfully decorated as pictured and described.  We noticed some extra goodies in the kitchen cabinets and ample cooking gear.  Loved the press coffee maker and fresh coffee beans with grinder, retro kitchenware and the supply of umbrellas!  We only wished we could have stayed longer. This was a perfect location for us with great access and easy street parking.  We most certainly recommend this unique place. My husband and I especially enjoyed Ballard historic area.  Stores and eateries were all conveniently nearby.  Thanks to you both for a lovely first time stay in Seattle.  "
2284536,19524471,2014-09-14,1525030,Elijah,"What a wonderful home base in a new city!  We weren't home more than 2hrs/day but that is no reflection of this place. We found it very familiar at the end of a day exploring nearby neighborhoods. We loved how it was so close to the bus stops that can take you to almost any part of Seattle. Ballard was a very charming neighborhood with a ton of great places to eat. We can't wait to come back!

Thanks for being a part of the most memorable vacation ever!"
2284536,19867337,2014-09-20,13027763,Chasette,"Rob and Molly were quick to respond and super accommodating, even letting me add a day to the reservation at the last minute. The house was the perfect, simple getaway:  easy to find, clean, comfortable, and gorgeous. It was a fantastic for our family (including a 7 and 4 year old)."
2284536,20032506,2014-09-22,20409356,Caroline,"It looks like the pictures! The perfect place to spend misty mornings at the coffee table before heading out for a Seattle adventure.
So accommodating, there was even a hair dryer in the hall closet! 
The neighborhood is adorable too, if you want to walk through rows of colorful houses, each with an adorable garden. Excellent coffee at Slate is a 5min walk away. 
Really enjoyed this place, would come back in a heartbeat!"
2284536,20146502,2014-09-24,8879071,Renee,"Cute, sunny, vintage home. I had picked up some coffee beans so was glad to have the grinder and French press to be able to make a good cup of coffee to enjoy on the side patio. It's a large space, and it's great to have the comforts of home while traveling!"
2284536,20685030,2014-10-04,15473213,Rosemary,"We stayed at Rob and Molly's sweet Ballard cottage for 9 days in Sep.  It was perfect for us.  Our daughter lives nearby and it was good to be so close.  The cottage was very clean and we had all we needed for our stay.  The nice touches of coffee and beer were much appreciated as was the candy jar (which our granddaughters loved!).  The cottage was close to all the amenities and it was great to be able to walk to shops and restaurants.
Hope Rob and Molly will have us back on our next visit!!"
2284536,20846582,2014-10-06,2176204,Michael,"Rob and Molly did a tasteful job decorating the interior of this dwelling with a retro modern flair, fitting of Ballard. The custom head board and vintage stereo were nice additions. The house is open on 3 sides so there was plenty of light. The fenced side yard was a comfortable retreat to have a drink and soak in the outdoors. Parking was easy and Slate cafe and Brimmer and Heeltap were great places just a 5 minute walk away. Walking to the Farmer's Market and Macefield music festival would have only taken 20 minutes, but we opted to drive with the little one. It was  a convenient home base for Golden Gardens and Carkeek Park as well. Overall a great place to stay in Ballard."
2284536,21028086,2014-10-10,5666866,Eva,"We loved Rob and Molly´s place in Ballard! The place felt very spacious with a lot of beautiful light, and the back deck was perfect for having a morning coffee in the sun. We slept very well there! It´s very close to everything you need - just a few blocks away from the Ballard market and the bus station for D-line to Seattle downtown, and if you walk a few blocks further you´re at Ballard avenue with lots of restaurants and bars. Communication and check-in was really easy. A perfect place to explore both Ballard and Seattle - we hope to come back one day!

2284536,21243675,2014-10-13,14929767,Joe,"We had a great time. The house was centrally located to everything. Very easy to get to other destinations. The only thing I missed was having a television to watch while trying to sleep. Other then that, great place."
2284536,21660640,2014-10-21,503868,Eli,"We had such a great stay at this lovely and cozy little home. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do, and the place had everything we needed. Parking was always easy, and being able to do laundry was such a big help. We loved the layout, decor, and being able to listen to KEXP all day! Check in and check out were a snap, and Rob and Molly were very communicative with us beforehand - we didn't end up having any issues at all that necessitated calling them while we were there, but I felt confident that we could have had we needed to. I was about 6 months pregnant while on this trip, and though we didn't need it quite yet, I really liked that they had a baby gear package available. I think just knowing that was a big part of why we choose this place, and I'm so glad we did! Can't wait to come back at some point with our little one!"
2284536,21852547,2014-10-25,3151565,Michele,"My time in Seattle/Ballard was spectacular and a lot of that had to do with Rob and Molly's great house and hospitality! The place was cozy, comfortable and in a fantastic location. Rob and Molly were excellent communicators and very helpful hosts right from the beginning, while I was booking the space. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend this listing to friends visiting the area. 
The location is perfect. It's within walking distance to adorable pubs, pizza and coffee [less than 5 minute walk] and, if you're an avid walker [which I am], it's only a 20 minute walk to Ballard Ave and some of the best eating, drinking and shopping establishments in the city. The Seattle Locks park is a short drive away and a lovely spot....just perfect! "
2284536,22023875,2014-10-28,21356930,Elsa,"Listing was as described, very charming little place and a great home base for us while exploring Ballard and the rest of Seattle. The neighbourhood was quiet, safe and close to what we wanted to see in Seattle. Molly and Rob were exceptionally accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The beer, wine and candy were a great touch! I would not hesitate to book this place again. Thanks!"

We got in late on a Friday from Portland, but the outside light was on and the radio was playing quietly when we arrived. Very welcoming. The place was tidy and there was ample space for the 4 of us to spread out.

The kitchen was stocked with pots & pans and we were all set to make a quick breakfast before heading out to explore for the day.

Great access to the Zoo and Green Lake Park. Overall a great home base for exploring Seattle."
2284536,22964636,2014-11-18,4756915,Nephertiti,Lovely accommodation and great location!  I really liked the vintage appeal as it made it feel more like home. Definitely plan on returning to Ballard during the warmer months.

Perfect location and size, super comfortable, just terrific. Perfect for a writer's retreat, or any kind of decompressing. Would absolutely stay here again. Loved it. "

Very cozy and with any  amenity you might need during a stay. A lot of nice touches (beer in the fridge, coffee in the cabinets) that were welcome even if I didn't get around to using them. 

They're also incredibly quick about getting back to you if you have any questions or concerns.

Great property and great hosts."
2284536,25130010,2015-01-07,20322264,Chris,"I was disappointed in the rental.  It had no television (my fault for not noticing this in the description) and the furniture was sparse and not very comfortable.  In short, it was not a nice place to relax... We only slept there.  Shower was not hot.  I would not rent again, and will be much more skeptical of AirBnB in the future."
2284536,25512298,2015-01-18,20127594,Douglass,"The location was perfect and the house was nice. Kitchen was easy to use and had plenty of appliances, just double check before you begin cooking to make sure you're prepared. Plenty of towels and sheets to use."

2284536,26374229,2015-02-10,17602458,Kristen,"Great neighborhood, neat place. We had a little trouble getting anything for the baby because Rob was out of town, but he was really helpful. The space works well for adults.  The vintage theme is consistent throughout, and we didn't have any trouble with the furniture being uncomfortable as one reviewer had mentioned. It was much bigger than it seemed from the front, and though it was a duplex, we never heard the neighbors.  "
2284536,27226444,2015-02-28,15538968,Ben,Everything was great and exactly as the description and pictures describe. The hosts are very communicative and helpful.

2284536,28667300,2015-03-28,22687200,Michael,It was great. Most everything was perfect.
2284536,28980114,2015-04-02,3499201,Doug,"Love the house - great decor and feel. Excellent location - near Veraci Pizza, Ballard Market, and much more. 

Having local coffee and beer on hand is a nice touch.

Rob and Molly are always very quick to respond to any questions."
2284536,29687832,2015-04-11,11363544,Maria,"We had a great time in Seattle. Rob and Molly's place was the perfect fit for us. Awesome neighborhood, cute house and thoughtful hosts. 
The house has everything you could need for a stay in Seattle. It was clean, quiet and walkable to some great stuff. We walked to the zoo, the attached Green Lake Park and to dinner at Phinney Market (highly recommend especially if traveling with children). Rob and Molly also had baby items for those traveling with babies/kids. Molly brought over some toys and books for us as well, my kids really enjoyed that. 
All in all, it was an enjoyable time. I would certainly recommend Rob and Molly's home. 
"
2284536,29855787,2015-04-13,29475254,Karlea,"Perfect size for 4 (college friends). We were visiting Seattle for a conference and spent most of our time away from the home exploring, but the home was exactly what we needed. Not too big, not too small, just right. The area is also great with a variety of food options. Thanks Rob and Molly :) "
2284536,30161437,2015-04-18,30713317,Lisa,The house was clean and comfortable. Walking distance to all the shops and restaurant in Ballard. A great place to stay outside of the bustling downtown Seattle area. 
2284536,30927806,2015-04-29,28257645,Debbie,"We arrived to a very dirty house, all of the trash that was left from the previous renters was everywhere, dirty linens were on the floor the whole house is in disarray. We emailed the owners and Molly showed up saying she was going to clean the house while we walked around town, we gave her the benefit of the doubt and while she was explaining things to do and places to go we witnessed her washing the dishes with hand soap and her bare hands because there was no sponge, it was disgusting, plus we came back and nothing was cleaned. We had to spend the whole next day cleaning the entire house so that we felt comfortable,not to mention we bought our own cleaning supplies because there was none in the house. The only good thing about the whole experience was the location and the neighbor. I also miss placed an item and I emailed the owners in which they never responded not even to tell me they didn't find anything so I would never recommend this place to anybody!"
2284536,31577099,2015-05-07,268888,Mike And Paloma,"The check-in was very easy, and the house was, as advertised, legitimately vintage - in a way that took me back to childhood spent in elder relative's houses - was a lot of fun to see how they preserved that era simply and faithfully. 

I enjoyed the short walk from the house to Brimmer and Heeltap, an amazing restaurant / bar, and to the coffee shop across the street from there (Slate). In the morning, Woodland Park isn't too far away if you're up for a beautiful jog through a well-kept neighborhood with scenic views of seattle. 

The street the house is on is a busier one, and the house seems to be part of a duplex, but we heard no noise during our stay. 

Rob and Molly were great hosts, leaving the house with magazines and brochures and maps of the area, and even kind enough to offer to send an item I'd left behind in the house. Very great time here and highly recommended for those who wish to be in the Ballard neighborhood."
2284536,31897728,2015-05-11,29706001,Steve,What can I say? Your place was perfect for my trip! It was so quiet and peaceful. I would (and will) recommend it to others who are going to Seattle. I love the fact that there was no TV! Sitting in the front room with music softly playing made me feel right at home. Thanks for everything! Steve
2284536,32247703,2015-05-16,2317688,Lizzy,"We had a wonderful stay in this rad little house. It was quiet, cozy, and had every amenity we could have wanted - we loved the vintage radio!  The location was perfect; just a short walk or drive to everything we wanted to do in the Ballard neighborhood.  Rob and Molly were very kind and made the check-in/out process a breeze.  A great experience all around, and highly recommended!  "
2284536,33238002,2015-05-26,4361032,David,"Very cute little home/apt with an authentic style. The vintage style is real and it makes you feel like you travel in time. 
Rob and Molly were great hosts: responsive and helpful, they really made everything easy and convenient."
2284536,33985054,2015-06-03,13027763,Chasette,"This was our second stay at Rob and Molly's place and it was even better this time. In town for a week for a family wedding, we came home to fresh peonies and a chocolate bar. There was a slight issue with the shower in the middle of the stay, but we were able to reach Rob right away and it was fixed before the day was over.  We were also able to borrow various baby equipment for our 3 month old that made the stay stress free for all of us.  This is a perfect sanctuary owned by a thoughtful couple to use while exploring all Seattle has to offer.  "
2284536,34226964,2015-06-06,4738799,Russell,Great place! Just as it was described. The house is pretty and everything worked fine. We didn't meet Rob or Molly but they were really responsive and made sure that we had everything we needed. Location is also very good. Many buses right outside but also an easy walk to Ballard. 
2284536,34434649,2015-06-08,12360038,Carol,"We never met Rob or Molly, but the apartment was all set up for us, so we had no questions. "
2284536,34642810,2015-06-10,25077718,Jamie,"obsessed doesn't even begin to describe how we felt about this little home... we loved staying here + in the ballard neighborhood. in fact, we were able to spend our entire time in seattle just wandering around  the area, checking out all the shops, breweries and happy hour oysters. the home was perfect for our little family of 3, and our tiny especially loved sitting on the front porch + watching the passers-by. we'll definitely be back!"
2284536,35632259,2015-06-21,25018200,Cristina,"The molly and rob's vintage cottage is in a very nice part of Seattle: it is  close to bus stop to downtown, to food market and nice bars and restaurants.
The house itself is confortable; however, it could be better equipped.
In the kitchen, for instance, additional pots and pans would be useful and the refrigerator is quite noisy. Also the house cleaning could be improved. Molly and Rob were really fast to reply to all questions and to provide us with suggestions and pratical information.
In the complex our stay was fine and we really loved Seattle!!"
2284536,35928430,2015-06-23,21255984,Benjamin,"Rob and Molly don't take the term 'vintage' lightly...a lot of care and effort has gone into decorating and filling this place with unique vintage and retro objects. Everything from the cool dish ware to the original bathroom tile to the furniture had an old time charm to it. You won't find a microwave here, but the rest of the kitchen basics are there including a funky electric kettle from days gone by. 

We were pleased with the value of our stay.  For less than a hotel, in a city that has been reported to be more expensive than New York for accommodations during the summer, we had an entire home in an excellent location. It was great to be walking distance to several breweries and restaurants and just down the street from one of our most enjoyable coffees in Seattle (Slate Coffee). Free street parking in front of the house was always abundant. 

Other positives: clean, private, quiet (we never heard the duplex neighbours through the walls), comfortable temperatures even in warmer weather but has a giant portable fan if you need it, great shower head, everything worked, etc. "
2284536,36658306,2015-06-30,24323722,Olivia,"We had such a wonderful experience at this cute little house. Everything was great-- very clean, conviently located , and ample parking. I am originally from Seattle and would not consider staying anywhere else again when visiting friends and family."
2284536,37187915,2015-07-05,32205684,Suzanne,"The hosts were very willing to help us. For us the best part of the home was the location! We experienced Ballard like the locals do, esp loving the restaurants Delancey and Essex, and the downtown parts of Ballard. The house was clean and easy to park at."
2284536,37828600,2015-07-11,19864929,Salome,"The listing was accurate, place was clean and welcoming. It felt very homey! The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!"
2284536,38257865,2015-07-14,4752423,(email hidden),We enjoyed staying at Rob and Molly's place. Ballard is well located and filled with cool places nearby. The house is small and cute and we were able to do a load of laundry. Every morning we walked up the hill to Phinney for breakfast at a nice Japanese bakery. It was a fine stay. I wish I had drunk more of the beer Rob was kind enough to have left. 
2284536,38835447,2015-07-19,26949011,Jamie,"This was a great little place! We loved our stay! Rob and Molly were extremely helpful as hosts and everything was accurately described in the information provided! Would definitely recommend others to stay here! Great house, perfect neighborhood. Lovely hosts:) "
2284536,39154245,2015-07-21,1038583,Jill,"Grea location!  We were able to walk to great restaurants, coffee spots, and downtown to hear some good music at an open mic night - and caught the fantastic farmers market on Sunday! Plenty of space for what we needed. No problems parking on the street, and coffee available along with a few cold ones in the frig! Molly & Rob were close if we needed - only a text away and responded quickly.  I would recommend this cozy cottage if you were visiting Seattle or Ballard."
2284536,39480830,2015-07-24,2127563,Janet,"Great little place! Looks just like the pictures and is very charming, as advertised. We didn't get to meet Rob and Molly in person but they were always so friendly and accommodating when we contacted them by phone/text. Check in and check out were easy and hassle free. Highly recommended!"
2284536,40081429,2015-07-28,4119964,Melissa,Sweet space in a great location. It had everything we needed and was as listed. Rob and Molly provided a comfy home away from home. Really enjoyed all the amenities that were within walking distance. Loved that our dogs were welcome and it was great having an enclosed side yard for them. 
2284536,42382392,2015-08-13,31754410,Mary Anne,We enjoyed our stay at Rob and Molly's sweet apartment. It was clean and adorable. Rob and Molly were always available by cell or text and helped us out immediately with a few problems we encountered. Thank you Rob and Molly for providing a home away from home while we visited our son!
2284536,43222798,2015-08-18,6723530,Sarah Jane,"This place is absolutely adorable and was a really nice stay for my husband, young son and I. The location can't be beat. The house is very convenient to the bus, walking to coffee or snacks and Ballard Market or Safeway. Having the kitchen for warming up meals for our 1 year old or making snacks to take with us was a huge help.  The only downsides to the spot is first- the shower could use a little repair. While it was clean, it is peeling paint and showing wear. Second, we found the couch in the living room to be unusable for sitting (we did not roll it out), it was just too worn out to be comfortable. Even with these small issues we still found the house to be a great value for the price. "
2284536,43903193,2015-08-23,28310307,Scott,The house was exactly as described. Very clean and spacious. Nice neighborhood and just close enough to downtown. Also lots of things to do in a short drive. Good parking!
2284536,44685555,2015-08-28,6978251,Jason,The place was clean and nicely located. Rob and Molly were great hosts.
2284536,45056464,2015-08-31,3452503,Cecelia,The home was lovely and well appointed.  We were very happy with the location as well!  
2284536,46355098,2015-09-09,11707790,James,"rob and molly were terrific!  they were remarkably prompt and wonderfully hospitable.  the house was cozy, clean, well furnished and perfectly located.  it was just what we needed!"
2284536,47155802,2015-09-16,15872207,Leslie,"I took my Mother to Seattle to visit my daughter, and wanted to stay in my daughter's neighborhood The house was exactly like the photos, cute , clean and a little quirky. The location was perfect for us - in Ballard, near shopping, nightlife, main roads to Seattle, and my daughter's apartment! Rob and Molly were prompt to respond, and extremely helpful when we had questions about the house and the area. I would totally recommend Rob and Molly and their properties to any Airbnb-ers. "
2284536,47687455,2015-09-21,4647162,Celeste,"Cute home, accurate description aside from only one beer in fridge ;-P "
2284536,48361811,2015-09-25,44831620,Aimee,"We had a fantastic time! Thank you so much for having is, especially on such short notice. The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in. (: My mom enjoyed a beverage or two from the fridge and the coffee in the morning. It was easy to find, right near the bus stops (like you said) and only a few blocks from restaurants that we really enjoyed! Also, being from out of the States, having access to Wifi was great. Thank you so much again! "
2284536,48997673,2015-09-30,38565090,Kristine,"My family of 4 stayed very comfortably in this delightful, 1-bedroom, 1-bath, larger vintage home with a really great location and proximity to everything around Seattle. We all really used the home, cooked lots of meals and used the pull-out sofa bed every night. Everything included in the home works fine, and we even did several loads of laundry which was located in the older basement, but all was functional. 
If you like the charm of an older home, you will love this unit just fine. 
There is also a side yard for our boxer to hang out in, but might recommend more chairs if you have more than 2 staying. 
We also loved the fact that you can walk to really nice grocery stores full of organic foods. 
Hats off to Rob and Molly for a really nice stay :) 
"
2284536,49328170,2015-10-03,3056160,Brigetta,"Our stay with Rob and Molly was perfect.  It was a cozy, convenient place to stay.   The location is unsurpassed.   It felt very welcoming and had some wonderful amenities (coffee, beer, laundry).  It was great for my family and my 2 large dogs.  Rob and Molly were available, but unobtrusive.  I would definitely stay with them again on future visits.  

"
2284536,49771384,2015-10-06,17756135,Kathy,"Very vintage, as described.  The place was easy to find and parking was always available.  Lots of hot water. Very close to wonderful central Ballard hipness.  Neighbors very quiet and friendly. Thanks for the fresh coffee and the colas."
2284536,50025326,2015-10-08,29046935,Elena,"A cute, nice spot! We didn't meet Rob & Molly, but everything was simple & straight-forward. "
2284536,50493860,2015-10-12,6775598,Antoinette,"The description of the amenities were very accurate .
The host was right there upon our arrival and helped us immediately to find the key and left clear instructions if we needed any help 
We liked the little apartment . It suited our needs.  Very good wifi
Couch in living room is worn out 
House has a worn look from outside"
2284536,51296446,2015-10-19,36725328,Le-Mai,"Loved our stay at Rob and Molly's place!  It's cute, clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood - close to many restaurants and breweries!  It was exactly as I expected, and I cannot wait to come back again for another visit!"
2284536,51891054,2015-10-25,36952893,James,"Rob and Molly left us a warm welcome of flowers, local chocolate and wine. Immediately upon arriving, it felt like home, which is a great comfort when traveling. 
The house was clean and neat with plenty of clean towels and linens for our use. There was a stack of tourist guides and local news sources to give us great ideas of sites to see, food to eat, and places to go.  
Despite being in a major traffic artery, the noise of cars was minimal and not disruptive, and the convenience of being near a great grocery, local restaurants and walkable breweries far outweighed the minor noise. Parking on the street in front was always a breeze, regardless of time of day or day of the week. 
I would stay here again and again. "
2284536,52759627,2015-11-01,1523625,Casey,"The place was perfect for my work trip. Cozy, comfortable and the hosts were very attentive."
2284536,53523297,2015-11-09,43685266,Tanya,"Our weekend in Ballard was superb!  The house was adorable, exactly as described, very charming and ""retro"".  Close to all the action, we were able to walk all over the place in spite of the famous Puget Sound rain.  And the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  Seriously, I would come back just for the bed!  Advice to any out-of-towners, make sure you visit the Chittenden locks while you are in town, very interesting visitor centre there."
2284536,53795556,2015-11-12,38865239,Cathy,"lovely and clean, and I found all i needed,

There are so many good things about this place including ease with parking, a place for my dogs and close to downtown.  Though the house is on a main road, it was quiet.

"
2284536,54152856,2015-11-16,23578257,Emily,We absolutely loved our stay in Ballard! Rob and Molly were very accommodating with our check in and check out times and their place was exactly what we were looking for - vintage and charming. Even though the cottage is older it seemed very well insulated and the heat warmed the place up quickly enough for us thin-blooded southern Californians. I especially appreciated the list of nearby recommendations provided and the treats of coffee and beer left for us. Our first visit to Seattle was a wonderful one - thanks Rob & Molly! 
2284536,54348645,2015-11-18,21989080,Teresa,"I needed a quick place to stay for one night while some construction was done on my home in Ballard and this was the perfect spot. A sweet little vintage duplex, with a lovely kitchen and plenty of space! It reminded me of my first apartment in LA! Rob and Molly were very responsive. I'd definitely recommend the place!"
2284536,54559859,2015-11-21,7742581,Andrea,"Rob and Molly are spot on when it comes to the description of the place and it is an amazing vintage Ballard throwback (but with good taste). They were super responsive and check-in was a breeze, and they allowed my dog to come! More importantly, they left local coffee and beer in the fridge upon arrival .... I felt very at home."
2284536,55793729,2015-12-06,36276269,Stacy,"This is an adorable house less than a mile from Ballard's main drag. It was extremely clean when we arrived, and had everything you'd need while away from home. Fixtures are definitely vintage, but they all work, and it adds to the charm of the house. "
2284536,56056687,2015-12-08,367930,Cary,"Rob and Molly's Ballard beauty was truly wonderful to stay in. Spacious, comfy and perfect for a nice weekend in Seattle, so nicely set up we could have stayed much longer in comfort, alas time was short for this visit to Seattle. "
2284536,56966291,2015-12-20,153282,Angela,"Love! We really enjoyed our stay at this great spot. Adorable, quaint, and just the place we were looking for!

Rob and Molly are awesome hosts! From booking, and all the way past departure; we had a great experience. 

Cute setup, as the decor was totally fab!  So many of the items, down to the toaster, glassware, tables, chairs, original wood floors - all totally circa 40's-1950 - you really are walking into a historical flashback.

Something particularly enjoyable (iop) is you're a bit off the ""tech"" grid, if you choose to be. While there's excellent WiFi, you're blessed with no TV, no micro, no need to ""sit around online"" or laze away with Netflix. 

Can't say enough about how super amazing Molly and Rob are as hosts. Great hosts always makes a difference. I'll def check their calendar again when back in Seatown..."
5446513,32708923,2015-05-20,5773110,Nick,"Place was great! Near everything and the coffee shops and restaurants down stairs were awesome.  Had dinner on the balcony one night and loved the pool table and fire pits. Only complaint would be Amazon construction across the street, but wouldn't start until about 9am. "
5446513,34213716,2015-06-06,32088759,Diana,"The unit was very nicely decorated, clean and quiet. Great location, walking distance to all the sights. We enjoyed our stay."
5446513,39922390,2015-07-27,32443330,Dusty,Condo was as described. Zero hassles. Decent neighborhood and located in a central location. Felt like a home. Good experience all around.

6130287,35169344,2015-06-15,35078339,Wakaba,"My friend and I had a great time staying there. Our host, Karina, was really nice, friendly, and kind person, also the place was located in Ballard so we could walk around and explore the neighborhood during our stay. She also gave us recomendations on some tourist attractions. As I said she was friendly and welcomed us a lot, but at the same time, she respected our private time so we could feel relaxed and comfortable staying at her apartment. Her pets were so adorable too! This was my first time using airbnb so I was a little bit nervous at first, but I'm glad I could make a good choice staying in such a nice person's place! "
6130287,35757039,2015-06-21,36157462,Kelsey,"Had a great first airbnb experience with Karina. We were nervous about trying it out, but she made us feel very welcome. She was very hospitable and gave us good suggestions on local tourist attractions and transportation advice. It was our first time in Ballard and we had a wonderful time with the help of Karina. She was very honest, upfront about the accommodation, and friendly. Her pets are also the sweetest! If we ever make the trip down for the Solstice Parade again, we will most definitely get in touch with her. "
6130287,37023123,2015-07-03,7469357,Katrina,"I loved staying with Karina, she was so incredibly welcoming and I felt completely relaxed around her and her two beautiful fur babies (one adorable sweet natured dog and one cool cat). Karina was such a great host, you could hang with her or do your own thing. She was never in your space and if you did want the place to yourself she was more than happy to do so. I was more than happy hanging out with Karina, she has been living in Ballard for years and knows all the hidden treasures. Ballard is such a great neighborhood and Karina's apartment was in a great location.  "
6130287,38025057,2015-07-12,36559609,Bethany,"Karina was a wonderful hostess! Her apartment was sparkling clean, very cozy, and very welcoming. She was also EXTREMELY helpful, telling me how to get there via public transportation, giving restaurant recommendations, and various other tips that really made a huge difference. The location of her apartment is ideal, and only a short walk to downtown Ballard, which has cute shops, restaurants, and pubs.

I absolutely and highly recommend Karina. She's extremely attentive, sweet, and very welcoming."
6130287,38678969,2015-07-17,16742002,Rob,"Karina's dog was awesome! And so was her cat! And also, Karina was pretty great company as well :) Nice apartment in Ballard, we had a great stay, and would stay again in a heartbeat."

6130287,42788796,2015-08-15,32374908,Julia,"Karina (a great AirBnb host), Lucy (the amazing, never (!) barking and good smelling - I wish my dog was like that - dog) and Phylo (the chillin' and friendly cat) are AMAZING!!! We highly recommend staying with Karina at her well located, very clean and big (it is actually much bigger than it appears on the pictures - you have plenty of space) apartment in the trendy neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. Market Street was our favorite street: many great local and alternative bars, restaurants and shops AND great people. It's a very save area with plenty of stuff to do! For instant you can visit the Ballard Locks and watch the ships coming in to the port of Seattle. It's also easy to get downtown. You just take the bus around the corner and you're there in about 10 till 15 min (depending on traffic). Thank you for the great time :) "
6130287,47579940,2015-09-20,32040775,Martha,My husband and I got in a bind when our original bnb was cancelled at the last minute. Karina took us in and we had a very good experience. She was very open and made us feel right at home. We could catch the bus right outside her apartment and there were restaurants within walking distance. My husband and I wanted to steal her pets and take them home. Thanks Karina
6130287,49564618,2015-10-04,45448527,Lisa,Karina is considerate and helpful; everything worked out great with my stay!
7988300,50409744,2015-10-11,41514731,Chad,"Was so glad to discover this gem in the Alaska Junction of West Seattle. First off, the house was wonderful and the use of detail that was given made it welcoming and very much mi casa, su casa. It literally was within a stone's throw of the business district with a very lively Farmers Market on Sunday mornings and the main rapid express bus line to downtown Seattle. The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom had it's own private bath and a wonderful view of Puget Sound. All amenities were provided by Rich and Harry, who were amazing hosts and one could definitely tell they had a passion for this. I hope to make this place my next stay when I come back to Seattle. Thanks again for a wonderful weekend guys!"
7988300,51508697,2015-10-20,46301380,George,"Rich is an extraordinary host, and I do not say that lightly.  His place has a great vibe to it, and I think that vibe comes from how much love Rich puts into what he is doing.  The rooms are immaculate, the beds comfortable, and the towels and sheets are really nice.  I would highly recommend it."
7988300,51823483,2015-10-24,46598151,Jared,A great place to stay. Clean. Quite. Got a good night's sleep before my wedding the next day. Thanks!
7988300,52023660,2015-10-25,15200871,Nhi,"We had a lovely stay at Rich's place in a charming part of Seattle. The room was exceptionally clean with a luxe hotel feel. Rich was easily accessible by telephone  and greeted us the next morning with fresh macarons from the local bakery. We would highly recommend this place and am very thankful for Rich's hospitality and kindness.
"
7988300,52629033,2015-10-31,12640488,Lilo,"Rich is a very kind and hospitable host! He organized our stay very well, responsed immediately and asked us several times if we need anything. 
The house is very nice arranged, absoluely clean and fully equiped with everything you need and more! Our room was very comfortable and cozy! Also the neighbourhood is nice and busses next to the door. We really enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend the accomodation and its host Rich absolutelly!!"
7988300,53158731,2015-11-05,21105463,Kristen,"Loved our stay! Felt like a hotel in a very very good way. Rich was super nice and gave us some awesome recommendations and was great to talk with! The home is very clean, modern and well taken care of. The room is spacious with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is big with double sinks and a huge shower stocked with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel! Rich even let us store our bikes in the garage for safe keeping. He doesn't live there but will stop by every once in a while to make sure all is good and tidy up whatever needs attention. Everything was perfect :)"
7988300,53230095,2015-11-06,48032622,Jamie,This was my first Airbnb experience and Rich's hospitality and professionalism exceeded my expectations. He gave clear instructions on how to use everything and was available to answer a call when I had a question. Everything was very clean and the room and house had a very welcoming vibe. I would definitely book a room through Rich again.
7988300,53407472,2015-11-08,22123617,Chrystel,Wonderful host and beautiful/spotless/modern condo! Highly recommend. Thanks Rich! 
7988300,54024457,2015-11-15,47143004,Benno,"I really enjoyed my stay at this appartment. The room was tidy and included everything you need. Although the shared living room and the kitchen were awesome.
As described, you can easily get downtown in minutes, the best way is the bus."
7988300,54546245,2015-11-21,12016162,Anthony,Great place for my short stay. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place in West Seattle
7988300,55693577,2015-12-04,49566223,Antony,"My girlfriend and I loved the location, cleanliness and comfort of the home, as well as the awesome West Seattle neighborhood. Very close to bus stops, restaurants, drinks and groceries. Rich was quick to respond on any question or concern and happy to help. He even picked us up from a nearby bus stop when we got to West Seattle. This place certainly exceeded our expectations. We felt right at home and I would recommend his spot to anyone!"
7988300,55822313,2015-12-06,29002100,Brenda,Everything exceeded my expectations. Insanely clean and comfortable. A quick distance from Seattle in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Very cozy and welcoming. Rich was very nice and welcoming. Five star experience!
7988300,56634597,2015-12-15,22266847,Julie,"Great place to hang out, Rich was very quick to respond to all emails. The house was very well equipped, everything you need in the kitchen to cook several meals. The location is excellent, 2 minutes walk to heaps of bars and restaurants on California. The bus ride to downtown Seattle costs $2.50 and takes 35 minutes. Room was spacious and very clean."
6762958,34759522,2015-06-11,35420430,Troy,Great stay in a great house.  1 mile to the beach and 15 minutes to downtown.  Backyard was perfect for enjoying my morning coffee.  Matt was outgoing and made me feel welcome.  I plan on staying here for future trips.
6762958,55511142,2015-12-01,42381396,Lydia,"Matt's place was perfect. He's in the process of a remodel, but its only cosmetic. He provided ample coffee options which is great for those caffeine addicts among us. I will note there was no TV, but that was frankly refreshing. This place is going down as one of my favorites for the next time I have family in town. Thanks Matt!"
6762958,55979794,2015-12-07,25015652,Kim,"We unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute due to an illness, so I can't write a review of the home. But working with Matt was excellent. He quickly responds, is thorough in his communication & was very sweet and refunded us part of the trip. 
We'll try to stay here next visit since he was great! 
"
6762958,58197485,2016-01-01,1286876,Randi,Loved the place. Modern and updated. Had complimentary root beer and beer. Nice bath with heated floors. Nice back yard that could be cool if it wasn't the winter time. Only one complaint is that the bed was too small for two people. Unless your a couple who doesn't move at all at night it was just to hard for us.
2720963,35336495,2015-06-17,2586021,Huston,Dan's home was amazing. My brother and his family could not have chosen a better place to stay in Seattle. It was the perfect homeless for their adventures in the city. And the pool is great to have in summer!
2720963,37217524,2015-07-05,36131182,Olamide,Stunning home in a great location. Very comfortable for our group and pool was a nice cherry on the cake.
2720963,39866371,2015-07-26,418134,Nicole,Super Gastgeber - Kommunikation und Organisation hat trotz der kurzfristigen Buchung (1 Tag vor Ankunft) super funktioniert. Das Haus ist großartig!
2720963,43123078,2015-08-17,6673958,Toby,"We loved our 4 day stay at Dans amazing house in Seattle. The house greatly exceeded our expectation and Dan was a very great host.
A highly recommended host to stay with and we are for sure coming back!"
2720963,43630434,2015-08-21,25816564,Alyssa,Dan was amazing. So hospitable and accommodating. The house was pristine and so homey. Best host ever really can't say enough.
108468,874485,2012-01-21,1501522,Mark,"The property was perfect for our company's summit, and we all thoroughly enjoyed staying there.  Our trip overlapped with a rare snow storm in Seattle, and both the host and the property manager stayed in touch with us to make sure that all was well and that we had a good trip."
108468,50128197,2015-10-09,3605012,Jeff,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8409975,49746004,2015-10-05,44918691,Otman,"La chambre se trouve au rez de chaussée de la maison, elle est super et le lit est très confortable. La salle de bain se trouve au même étage mais l'etat de propreté et le pommeau de douche laisse sérieusement à desire! La salle du bain en haut est beaucoup plus propre, plus agréable. Je n'ai paw ete accueilli à mon arrivée mais j'ai rencontré fortuitement Allesandro un soir. Je suis parti sans dire au revoir.... Bien pour les gens qui s'en foutent de rencontrer du monde donc un peu déçu dessus. On est aussi loin du centre ville, mais bon c'est les states, il faut une voiture à cet endroit."
8409975,50137623,2015-10-09,43436710,Olli,"It looks like the photos, it's very clean and comfortable. There is a lot of space to hang out but also your own room for privacy. In the morning we had breakfast for free and we could use the big kitchen. 
It is a little bit out of downtown, but the bus station is very close (6min walk) and you will need 45min to get from there to the city."
8409975,50974533,2015-10-16,2234440,Scott,"This was my second stay at Dario's place. The experience is more like staying in a small private hotel more than a persons home. Which I like. There are several Airbnb rooms so the house is setup for guests with common areas and kitchen access. Bathroom is shared by several people, but there was never a problem with wait time. I will be returning."
8409975,51100914,2015-10-17,46615488,Steven,"This place is great. There's a lot good that could be said but for brevity...comfortable bed, great breakfast options, nice location a quick bus hop from downtown like strips, peaceful neighborhood, and really friendly hosts. This is a SOLID option for travelers looking for a comfy environment. "
8409975,54621512,2015-11-22,8093171,Zack,"I never met the host but the room was really nice and comfortable. We had a good time. 
Mahalo "
8409975,55236991,2015-11-29,852749,Mary,"My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights while visiting his brother who lived nearby. The instructions for getting in and out were crystal clear, thanks to Alessandro. The front door is code operated, and super convenient. We met a woman when we first came in, and it was a little confusing at first as to who she was. It turned out that she was the manager of the place. She briefly showed us around and quickly disappeared. We didn't get to meet either Alessandro or Dario. The rooms and bathroom were clean, we stayed in one of the downstairs bedrooms. The radiator worked great, the mattress in the Carousel room is super soft, but comfortable. The downstairs is overall kind of dark, with mostly IKEA furnishings and kitchenware. There is plenty of breakfast options that they provide, which was really nice. Having access to the kitchen was a bonus. The other housemates were generally really quiet and respectful, we didn't have any trouble falling asleep, although footsteps overhead can be heard. Overall, we had everything that we needed, and it was a good base camp with all the conveniences. But if you're looking for a place with more life, love, and human interaction, this would not be my top choice. "
8409975,55582733,2015-12-02,3958661,Lora,"Dario is very proactive, responds quickly and is clear with information regarding a stay at his house.  The room and the whole house were clean and having use of the washer and dryer are really great perks.  Would love to stay here again!"
8409975,56289336,2015-12-11,50472295,Mike,The host was amazing! We felt right at home and everything was as we expected it. 
8409975,56412729,2015-12-13,47676013,Andres,"This host and accommodations are highly recommended for avid and new travelers alike. The Carousel room is cozy and inviting. The home is spacious, well kept and well stocked. If you approach with a good disposition meet new people; this place is a nugget of gold.  "
8409975,56582745,2015-12-14,45013688,Neev,Clean convenient and good amenities. 
8409975,56689646,2015-12-16,50232278,Max,The house was very clean and overall accommodating.
1100714,9967839,2014-01-21,10604107,Jannae,Such a great place and host! Erika was super easy to work with and helpful. The space is super private and quiet. We loved our stay and would not hesistate to go back.
1100714,10235120,2014-02-08,5294852,Charlene,"Great location and Erika's very flexible and laid-back. You're seconds from the main drag in Capitol Hill, yet it's quiet. The separate private entrance is really handy and I felt like we weren't intruding or anything even though it's part of the main house. The main bed (we only used one) is really comfortable - memory foam, I think! and the bathroom is funky in a colorful cool way. "
1100714,10373032,2014-02-16,12054481,Kara,"Erica was a gracious host, and even allowed us to park in her driveway overnight since street parking is hard to find in the neighborhood. The location is perfect for a weekend exploring downtown. The bed was memory foam and very comfortable, we both got a great nights sleep. My husband and I both agreed that for the price we would have appreciated more effort on her part in creating a clean and organized environment. Since Erica only has a couple reviews I'm assuming she just started renting this basement so I want to cut her some slack, but paying $100 a night I definitely want to feel more comfortable. So unfortunately I have to say if you're a neat person and want a ""sterile"" hotel type environment, this isn't the place for you. If you are like me you might be able to look past it based solely on the location and the fact that it was clean enough for sleep. "
1100714,10658592,2014-03-02,11332433,Lynarra,Great place to stay on Capital Hill!
1100714,10735961,2014-03-04,3191827,Samantha,"i made my reservation request very late because of an unanticipated flight rescheduling, and Erika was wonderful. she allowed me to arrive earlier than usual, which i really appreciated (saved me from walking around in the rain with luggage for an extra hour or so). the private entrance was a plus, and the space itself is large and quirky (i didn't realize at first that there was a main bedroom/living area until i made it through the bath/washer room). i didn't get to meet her in person, but she was a great host, and i had a lovely stay. also, great location (there's a park, and also a beautiful mural across the street from the building)."
1100714,10869518,2014-03-10,3572781,Mona,"Erica was a great host and very helpful when we got lost in Seattle. The Apartment was fun, a very spacious and funky place. The Location is superb; pretty much in the center of Seattles awesomest neighborhood Capitol Hill - though on a quiet street. We had great fun, even though it was a very short visit. "
1100714,11174396,2014-03-24,4566704,Katie,"Great location on a quiet street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Easy walking distance to so many restaurants and bars. I needed a place to crash for an extended stay for a visit with friends and a conference downtown (20 minute walk). I think this is a great spot for a weekend or a few days and you know you'll be eating out most of the time. If you are staying for more than 3 days, probably better to get a place with a small fridge or microwave (and a shower). I was happy with the tub and I knew there was no shower going into it. The second bed in the front room is nice, but one of my friends complained about the noise of the plastic covering the bed (the front room is not as nice and you have to walk through it to get to the toilet). The back room is very cozy and it was good to have wifi and use of the laundry room. You do hear the family upstairs (which didn't bother me) and some nights it would get pretty cold (but the large space heater solved this problem in the back room). Even though this has a separate entrance, it is not a stand alone unit, it definitely feels like you are staying in a room in someone's ""lived in"" house. Erika was very friendly and accommodating when my friend needed to park in the driveway and when I needed to have a package delivered to the house. She also provided detailed responses to all of my questions before my stay. I would recommend staying here, especially for a short weekend exploring Capitol Hill. "
1100714,11308074,2014-03-29,13079238,Leslie,"We arrived after dark so it was a bit difficult to find at first, but Erika made sure were in the right spot when we called her. We felt very safe in her neighborhood. The place is cozy and good for a night of passing through. She accommodated us with plenty of blankets and left a light on so we could find our way there. It's a little pricey for the location, and you do hear the family above you so keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper.  "
1100714,11375172,2014-03-31,13310427,Stephen,"This is a wonderful simple little space on Cap Hill. Erika was helpful and I could not be more pleased with getting to avoid the craziness of the Seattle hotel scene during Emerald City Comic Con.

A couple of quick things to note: Bed is super comfy and the sitting area is great for entertaining a guest or two. The space does not have a stand up shower but instead has an old fashioned bathtub. While a bit off putting at first, it was actually far better to indulge in a long soak in the spacious tub. I only mention it because some people expect a shower. My advice would be relax and enjoy the tub. I knew it didnt have a stand up shower going in so I was prepared, and it's a nice fixture so don't let that deter you. A selection of bath salts and other items were provided.

Being a ground floor apartment space, ceilings are fairly low in one or two spots. This is not a negative for me, but something worth mentioning if you are claustrophobic.

You're perfectly situated near Dick's Burgers and Cal park, everything else is just a stroll away.

Erika and her family live above the space and their children sound rowdy and happy in the morning. They don't wake up too early and the noise started around 9am, so remember there's a family up there! Everything was peaceful and quiet at night.

This was my first Airbnb experience and I would recommend it and hope to stay again."
1100714,11902586,2014-04-18,9794328,Lisa,"Very quaint little room. The toiletries  and books made it feel like home. I like the location, it is a street away from frequent buses and  cute shops."
1100714,12058240,2014-04-22,1164684,Andrew,"If location is what you are looking for, this is the place for you! It is centrally located in the trendy area of Capital Hill. The place itself is worth staying at. The main bedroom is very comfortable with a great seating area. Erika was very accommodating and responsive. When we needed a late night drop off of our luggage (airport lost our suitcase) she was great with the late night interruption. Erika was also kind enough to bring down a corkscrew and wine glasses when we asked for them. Besides that, much of what the others have said apply. There is no shower and the bathtub is a little awkward. I also wish the cleanliness of the room was a little better (room could have used a vacuum and once over). Overall, we were very happy with our experience and would not hesitate to stay here again.

Andrew & Eric "
1100714,12281041,2014-04-28,2144384,Ian,"Erika was really helpful. I was driving to the apartment and screwed up the directions and she guided me in by phone. She was also very gracious in allowing me to park on her driveway in front of her car (the normal arrangement is for guests to keep their car at the back). I stayed for four nights while visiting for work so I really only needed a place to sleep and it was a great location - other colleagues were staying out in the suburbs and needed taxis to get to meetings and for shopping trips. On that basis the apartment was fine but if I was vacationing or needed somewhere to work between meetings then I would have missed having more natural light and some basic cooking facilities and just a little bit more ""home comfort"""
