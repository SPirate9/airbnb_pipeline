3498114,42888243,2015-08-16,2441094,Alicia,"Lea's studio is a fine place to sleep - though I wouldn't recommend it if you plan to spend a significant time ""at home"" during your trip. It's quite small and the building seems like it's seen better days (especially the carpet), but it's really close to great bars and restaurants. 

One thing: the water pressure, as others has mentioned, was pretty bad. My partner and I joked that it was akin to trying to bathe using a basic park water fountain - major warning if you plan to go hiking!!!"
3498114,44442946,2015-08-26,6016687,Sarah And Daniel,Lea was very welcoming and helpful.  Provided lots of information for things to do in the area.
3498114,45244263,2015-09-01,15976021,Danny,"Lea's apartment was great. Was everything we needed. She was very accommodating, and the apartment is in a great neighborhood. Restaurants, bars, grocery and drug stores are nearby, and it's just a quick uber/lyft ride away to downtown or breweries in Fremont. "
3498114,46263788,2015-09-09,784784,Kate,Great location! Comfortable bed - easy check in / out. 
3498114,46528157,2015-09-11,42794324,Karin,For a short stay in Seattle Lea's studio was in an ideal location to easily reach downtown. Check in and check out was easy and convenient.  Street parking was the only challenge but this wasn't a surprise as we knew this in advance. We really enjoyed the restaurants close by too. Overall we were very satisfied with our experience 
3498114,47970553,2015-09-22,31516273,Patrick,A cozy little studio in a great location perfect for exploring Seattle. Lea also had a detailed guidebook with any information you might need and great suggestions for things to do.
3498114,48475092,2015-09-26,43215659,Morgan,"Lea's description of the apartment is very true to life.. Simple apartment with all the necessities! Perfect place to crash after exploring the city. Great location in Capitol Hill and finding parking was never too bad. I liked that Lea made left a travel guide for nearby attractions with her own personal comments. Only downside was, as mentioned, the weak water pressure both in shower and kitchen sink. "
3498114,49120387,2015-10-01,30914246,Charlie,"The neighborhood is great, which is why I live there. My parents came to visit and I put them up at Lea's place. It was very convenient and worked for what we needed.  "
3498114,49627611,2015-10-05,36751680,Aileen,"For a first time visitor to Seattle, this was the ideal place to stay. Lea's place is in a great location.. quiet street, two blocks from a grocery store, and walking distance to everything you can imagine. We spent the entire 3 1/2 day trip walking around the city, from our airbnb to grab morning coffee (Analog Coffee and Top Pot Doughnuts are great) we'd walk down Broadway and it's about a 30 minute walk downtown and to Pike Place Market and to Pioneer Square, which is a beautiful walk in the cool fall weather and you get to see a lot of the city. It's a great neighborhood, with a lively local scene and close enough to tourist activities. Lea's place is so cozy and quaint and has everything you need, including a full kitchen and cookware if you decide to cook there. We felt like we were at home in Seattle for a few days. Thank you Lea!"
3498114,49893462,2015-10-07,9105604,Leah,"Easy check in/out. I didn't need any direct communication during my stay, but Lea was available if I needed anything. The location was great, we were able to walk to the light rail (~1.5 mi), which took us to the stadiums and could also easily uber it elsewhere. The neighborhood had everything we needed - grocery stores, cafes, bars, restaurants. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this apartment. Only thing that was a bit of surprise was the loud pipes next to the bed in the morning (I assume from people in the building showering etc.). It's an older building, so there is nothing the host can do.. and I didn't mind the earlier wake up."
3498114,50455700,2015-10-12,41390411,Sara,"Lea's apartment is great - clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is nice as well - safe (as safe as any city, at any rate), and overflowing with places to eat and drink, and fun to explore. It's also easy to get to the rest of the city. As an added bonus, Lea provides a guidebook with suggestions of places to go/dine/etc.

Definitely a great place to stay in Seattle!!!"
3498114,50759398,2015-10-14,5469191,Nhat,"Lea's studio was very cozy for the two of us. Just a block walk away from coffee shops and restaurants, a short drive to the downtown area. The wifi was a bit spotty and street parking was a little challenging, but other than that we enjoyed our stay very much. "
3498114,51536717,2015-10-21,42530157,Kevin,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great.  Lea was very accommodating with our arrival time.  The apartment was clean and well kept.  Would definitely stay again if I'm ever back in the Seattle area.
3498114,52065202,2015-10-26,42937880,Felicia,"Lea's place was cozy without any clutter which we really appreciated.  The apartment is in a great location with fun bakeries (for a quick breakfast) and restaurants. 

There was a leaky sink issue before we got to the apartment, but Lea was prompt and really responsive about letting us know and getting it taken care of quickly. 

Overall we a had a great stay. "
3498114,54234152,2015-11-17,7300872,Sean,"Lea's spot was a great base camp for our trip to Seattle. Located in a great neighbourhood close to lots of awesome bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill and close to the #10 busline that takes you right to Pike Place. If you're looking for a simple place to keep your stuff and a bed to sleep in this is perfect. Only complaint would be the water pressure in the shower as it was pretty weak. 

Lea is also really good about being available and flexible for check-in/check-out and responding to any questions/concerns you might have.

Thanks Lea!"
3498114,54458879,2015-11-20,29001281,ZoÃ«,Lea was extremely easy to communicate with and made the check-in process the easiest I've ever had. I was only in town for 3 nights and this was a good deal as we just needed a place to sleep. Do keep in mind that it's a 100 year old building and the shower is pretty bad. I'm not so sure we would want to come back and stay here.
3498114,54701183,2015-11-23,28258406,Ray,Lea's place was great. It was very warm at night and in a quiet neighborhood of Capitol Hill!
3498114,55355266,2015-12-01,15508211,Shae,"Leas apartment was the perfect stay for our trip in Seattle. Our check in and out was so easy and hassle free! There is a great strip of shops just a street down from the apartment, with wonderful places to eat. The bus into town was easy and so useful with many busses coming back to our apartment often. Leas apartment is so cozy, and we highly recommend. "
3498114,56110036,2015-12-09,35709343,Jed,"Lea's apartment was perfect for our trip to Seattle. It's nothing fancy but it had everything we needed to have an enjoyable stay. Having a kitchen and TV was amazing. Especially Netflix, considering we couldnt sleep due to jetlag! We felt safe in the apartment building and it was always warm.

It's in a great spot in Capitol Hill close to public transport which we rarely used, choosing to walk most places instead (when it wasn't raining!). The apartment is close to Broadway which is littered with great restaurants and only a 35 minute walk to the Pine/Pike shopping district which was a great way to explore the city.

Lea was very friendly, extremely quick to respond to any questions we had and was flexible with our check-in time. Thanks for a great stay!"
9094836,52804803,2015-11-01,4660138,Rhey,"Alex met us to get us oriented and suggest parking so that went smoothly. The condo was very clean and neat, made us feel  like we were welcome and in for a special stay.  Condowas very comfortable to just sit and relax, but we eventually had to go to our show.  The views are outstanding, as is the location. Can see the Space Needle framed in a window outside the door and the bay and ships out the main windows. Also outstanding was the rooftop terrace which is very large and offers views in any direction.
 We walked to a New Orleans style restaurant just a few blocks away that I can't wait to try again.
We waited only a minute or two for Uber drivers to arrive when we did venture away from condo. Very convenient location.  
To sum up we had an outstanding trip and would stay in this condo again. "
50233,341252,2011-06-28,707486,Linda,This was our first try at airbnb and with such an excellent experience as we had with Marie & Brian not sure we could ever find another one that compares as well! Marie was attentive to ever detail and willing to bend over backwards to make sure we had everything we could possibly need. It felt like we were staying at our own home! Thank you both for such a great visit with our kids in Seattle!!
50233,1458179,2012-06-11,2381405,Stephen Ryan,"A wonderful and very clean property, well supplied and with very hospitable and gracious hosts.  Near to some great spots such as Alki Beach which has great views, restaurants and recreation.  We would definitely use West Seattle Vacation Junction again of future visits.

50233,1947851,2012-08-11,2608228,Kerry,"We arrived tired and weary after a long flight from the UK and received a wonderful warm welcome from Marie on arrival. As soon as we entered the apartment (via the private deck overlooking the beautiful garden, complete with humming birds) we felt cosy and at home straight away. The open plan lay out of the public areas was great for our party as we were a couple and 1 friend and so we could equally hang out together in the living space or retire to the comfortable beds. We were all also impressed with the size of the wardrobe / dressing rooms - in the UK these would be passed off as second bedrooms!  Marie and Brian had stocked the cupboards and fridge for us with the basics and then some. They printed out suggested running routes for us in the area and really couldn't have been more helpful, while at the same time giving us full privacy. We will definitely return to stay here if we are back in the area.
K, M & J
ps. This was the first time we used Air BnB and would definitely include it in future holiday accommodation searches."
50233,2132027,2012-08-29,392983,Jason,"If you're on the fence about where to stay on your visit to Seattle, then look no further.  Marie offered my family a wonderful experience at her clean, quiet, and soothing property. This is what Airbnb is all about.  Occasionally, you stumble upon a gem, and this is without a doubt one of them. Marie was an amazing host, who not only offered coupons for activities and information on the surrounding area, but also was extremely accommodating and very easy to communicate with about logistics.  With stays like this, I can't imagine ever staying in a hotel when visiting a city. I recommend her and her beautiful property without hesitation. Thanks for everything, Marie!"
50233,4511327,2013-05-09,317688,Per,"We stayed at Marie's place as a part of our three week tour of NW USA and it was our best Airbnb-experience on our entire trip.
The place is very clean, has a lot of space and the views from the deck is just fantastic.
Marie is the perfect Airbnb-host. She gave us a lot of good advice on what to see in Seattle and was very helpfull with our needs.
We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we come back to Seattle."
50233,13875021,2014-06-07,13318195,Leanne,"Our stay at the WSVACATIONJUNCTION was a great experience.  The house was very clean and nicely furnished.  The bed was one of the most comfortable we've slept in that wasn't our own.  When we arrived, there was food in the fridge and wine and bread on the table which was greatly appreciated after a long day of travel.  This was our first time using Airbnb and because of our experience with this house and the host Marie, we will using it again."
50233,14866384,2014-06-28,15538526,Jessica,"It's really nice to stay there and my family really like that place! We have great fun in Seattle and we all enjoy the place! It have a perfect location and really easy to get to the junction and take the c line to downtown! 
I strongly recommend this place and if next time we have chance, I will definitely ask Marie and invite my friends or relatives to come over^_^
Thanks again and we all love it!!! "
50233,15954957,2014-07-19,15229692,Deborah,"This is a great place to stay.  The dining area has large east-facing windows that let the sun stream in in the morning.  There is a covered balcony thatâs perfect  for morning coffee and evening glasses of wine.  It is beautifully appointed inside with walk-in closets in each of the bedrooms and a small but fully functional kitchen.  The house is set into a hill and is east facing so that in warm weather the interior stays a comfortable temperature.  The ""Junction"" area has several shops and restaurants and is within walking distance.  Finally, the owners live in the upper floor of the house but they are extremely quiet.  In the entire week we were there I think we heard them one time.  We loved our stay in this house, it is one of the nicest vacation rentals we have ever had.  
"
50233,18894541,2014-09-02,19198524,Pablo,"The place was amazing, and Marie was such a great host. Not only the place looks exactly like the post which already looks amazing, I think it actually looks even better and more spacious when you walk in. It is completely private. It has a great view, a private entrance and everything is spotless, very comfortable and clean, it was exactly what we wanted and we had a great time. It's a short drive to downtown Seattle, and just 5 min away driving you can get to the shore and run by the water watching the city skyline. Any time we are in Seattle in the future, we will go out of our way to stay with Marie again. "
50233,21359574,2014-10-15,485950,Chris,"Marie made us feel absolutely welcome. This is the best AirBnB that we have ever stayed in. It was of the highest quality and the space was beautiful and well cared for. 

To me, Marie embodies the spirit of AirBnB. She clearly loves to be a host and the care taken in her space and with her guests reflects that. "
50233,28756418,2015-03-29,16761189,Jackie,"Exceeded expectations. That's the most succinct way to put it. We were pleasantly surprised by everything - West Seattle, the immediate neighborhood, the property, the suite, the nice touches everywhere we looked (especially the wonderful food, snacks and wine that greeted us on our arrival) and finally by Marie and Brian. Should we ever visit the Seattle area again, we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. 'Nuff said."
50233,30777780,2015-04-27,28958268,Pirkko,"Olimme positiivisesti yllÃ¤ttyneitÃ¤ kohteesta kaikin puolin. Yhteydenpito majoittajan kanssa oli mutkatonta heti tilauksen varmistuttua. PerillÃ¤ kohteessa tunsimme olomme hyvin tervetulleiksi. Asunto oli kodikas, toimiva, hyvin varusteltu, siisti ja mikÃ¤ parasta - sÃ¤ngyt luksusta. YmpÃ¤ristÃ¶ todella rauhallista ja kaunista. Oikein miellyttÃ¤vÃ¤ majapaikka, suosittelen lÃ¤mpimÃ¤sti!"
50233,34559007,2015-06-09,12327353,Timothy,Marie made us feel so comfortably welcome! The unit is delightful with a glorious view East from the pleasant balcony outside the kitchen and dinning area. A special treat was the bottle of wine and chocolate and nibbles in the fridge. The garden itself was perfect to sit in for morning coffee and evening glass of wine.  We'll be back.
50233,35205488,2015-06-16,1930148,Pam,"The home at West Seattle Junction was wonderful! The host was warm and welcoming, the beds were ever so comfy, super clean and so very close to everywhere in Seattle! I would recommend this home to anyone planning to visit Seattle. "
50233,39167663,2015-07-21,22549095,Shannon,"Marie & Brian were wonderful hosts. I really enjoyed my stay in West Seattle. The giant loaf of fresh bread, wine & berries were a welcome sight after being on the road for weeks. The location is central, yet quiet. There is a handy notebook full of information on day tours, etc. Marie was great at responding to texts and we had a couple of nice conversations in passing about travel and such. It was the perfect place to stay for a couple of weeks and I would recommend this lovely apartment to my friends. I felt quite welcome and really fell in love with West Seattle. "
50233,41202773,2015-08-05,5912025,Anouk,"We couldn't have been happier with our whole rental experience.  Though we did not see Marie and Brian much (we were out exploring most of the time) the interactions we did have were pleasant and positive - my email questions to Marie before we came were answered promptly and were very helpful.  The location is terrific, we enjoyed the view from the deck, the proximity to Trader Joe's and buses, it was nice to stay in a neighborhood.  If we have the opportunity to go back, we would definitely like to stay there again! "
50233,43263586,2015-08-18,1236846,Judith,"Marie personally greeted us, and left the suite filled with healthy organic food and drinks.   The suite was just as pictured, and gave us the perfect location for our West Seattle visit.   The accommodations were clean and upscale.   We had everything we needed for our 3 day visit."
50233,44897242,2015-08-30,33598221,Laura,"This house was the perfect spot for our family vacation, located in a lovely neighborhood within walking distance of Trader Joe's and Starbucks!  The house was as described and upon our arrival we were welcomed with fresh bread and wine, as well as everything needed for a hearty breakfast for our first morning there. The covered porch with a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains was the perfect place to relax after a busy day of seeing the sights.  There was ample room for the four of us; I wasn't sure how we would handle sleeping arrangements when our kids refused to share a bed, but the problem was solved when we discovered the huge walk-in closet was large enough to accommodate a twin-size air mattress!  It was a perfect mini-bedroom!
We really enjoyed our stay here; Marie and Brian were very cordial hosts.  I would recommend this house to anyone who wants to stay in West Seattle and I hope that we will be able to stay here on our next trip."
50233,46172198,2015-09-08,15337281,Virginia,"Marie made us feel welcome when we came in by having lovely music playing, fresh bread and wine waiting for us. She then came down and introduced herself and Moshe her working dog who was a real gentleman and stole our hearts. Our 4 year old is a 1/4 of this dog's size but he felt comfortable enough to approach and pet the dog.
Everything was explained, entertainment coupons were available, the reading material provided was entertaining and the location was central to all we needed and wanted to do. It is a well laid out apartment with a lovely yard and included everything we could want. Plus surprise food was in every cupboard which made it feel like we were loved.
I would highly recommend this rental to anyone coming to Seattle."
50233,48327876,2015-09-25,43959162,Kate,"Wonderful hosts, warm and friendly people.  The accommodation was fantastic - home away from home and the little extras they provided were really appreciated - the wine and bread and cheeses etc.  Thanks so much for a wonderful stay."
670262,3496724,2013-02-08,2044151,Troy,"I had an absolutely painless experience staying with Elisa and Tom. The house is clean and the bedroom is well-appointed (radiant floor heating is amazing).

It's in a wonderful location that's at once quiet and a few blocks from the retail core on Greenwood, including a Fred Meyer grocery store and lots of restaurants. The buses to downtown are frequent and fast.

Elisa has thought through lots of small but helpful logistics, such as providing a kitchen shelf for my pantry items (without needing to ask). She genuinely cares and it shows.

I can't recommend staying with Elisa and Tom highly enough."
670262,23441659,2014-12-01,22758855,Rich,"Itâs not possible to be more positive about Elisa and Tom (and the Tango Room).

First, Elisa and Tom are incredibly warm, welcoming, and gracious hosts. They made it very easy for me (an East Coast transplant moving out to Seattle ahead of my fiancee) to slowly transition into Seattle. I think it took an afternoon (maybe less) to ""feel them out"" and decide that I'd definitely be comfortable staying beyond the initial month. They're friendly, super easy to talk to, and very respectful.

Second, the house is great. It's clean, warm, bright, and well laid out. An upstairs living room and adjoining kitchen are great for cooking and hanging out with Tom, Elisa, and any other guests (assuming anyone is home, which isn't always the case). The room itself is cozy with two small closets that do the job, and the private bath is a nice bonus (fear not, it has exceptional water pressure!).

Third, the Greenwood neighborhood is really quite nice. It's a little quieter than Phinney or Green Lake, but it has the feel of a neighborhood that's finding it's own personality. It definitely has a chill, neighborhood vibe - but there are loads of restaurants, coffee shops, and pubs within walking distance. The Fred Meyer right around the corner is also pretty nice.

I can't recommend staying here enough!





Located in the fantastic Greenwood neighborhood, it 
The listing was spot on and the house has a very nice layout.

9546508,55316401,2015-11-29,2408877,Joe,"Clean, efficient little studios in a great location at a great price! A real find! This is not your typical AirBnB experience, and that's what I liked about it. I don't want to be up in someone's house awkwardly making small talk and pretending to be their old friend visiting for the weekend. I like my privacy and I like to respect other people's privacy. 
The studio I stayed in was small and a bit spartan, but clean and a great price for the excellent location. There are spacious common areas - a kitchen on each floor and a much larger kitchen/lobby area on the first floor. The walls and floors seemed like they could have let noise through, but I wasn't disturbed by anyone else in the building or any noise from the street. "
451012,1582816,2012-06-28,2563858,Shon,Sasan was a joy to work with.  He went above and beyond everything he said he would do.  His home is beautiful and comfortable.  He even cleared space in his fridge for us.  The girls room was perfect for my nieces and the space was very warm and welcome.  
451012,9470893,2013-12-30,10296051,Kelly,"The pictures for this home do not do it justice. It was spacious, warm, comfortable and in a great location. The owner was helpful, quickly responded to questions, and very friendly. 1 King bed, 2 twin and 1 what I think was a double bed downstairs. My family was in town for Christmas to spend time with other family members that live in the area. The home and dinning room was spacious enough for us to host an enchilada dinner for our 13 person family.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and because of this owner's hospitality we are already looking at vacation homes for our next adventure."
5051529,27593867,2015-03-08,9211636,Sue,"This place was even bigger than it appeared in the pictures (that never happens!)!! It was comfortable and perfect for 6 adults. I think we learned the hard way that ""essentials"" in Airbnb language doesn't mean shampoo/conditioner - oops. Nonetheless, enjoyed the quite location that was the perfect distance from all desired destinations in the Seattle area."
5051529,33075515,2015-05-25,24203657,Jocy Ann,"The condo was bigger than what we expected!  It was very easy to access from the SEA TAC airport and only about 10 minutes away from Seattle.  The condo comes equipped with pretty much EVERYTHING you need just not shampoo or bath soap which is OK because I always bring my own anyway.  The beds are soooo comfy too!  

The owner leaves a very descriptive folder on the coffee table about the condo and the surroundings, so be sure to look there!  The owner is also very helpful and responded to my emails in a matter of minutes.  Next time I am in Seattle I will definitely stay here again!   "
5051529,33428257,2015-05-28,27472225,Tao Yin,"The condo was perfect for 5 adults n 2 kids. We stayed for 3 nights and even had a chance to cook in the condo a couple of times. It is not too near the city but it was a good enough location to get around the places we wanted to go (e.g., Pike Place, outlets, Shops). Mercy was really helpful with providing information we required as tourists and also has a folder in the apartment with guides and tips for us! The rooms were spacious and we didn't have any issues with putting suitcases around! Fully equipped kitchen with dishwashing, laundry n dryer. Would definitely recommend this listing! "
5051529,34271409,2015-06-07,25797982,Courtnee,"When we first had arrived to our place, we had showed up and our place hadn't been cleaned picked up from the previous guests that had been here. We were all a little disappointed at first, but mercy turned the situation right around and helped us get the situation taken care of! She is very professional and was wonderful to work with! When I come back to Seattle, I'll definitely stay here again! Thanks for making our trip so enjoyable and thanks so much for taking care of us:). we had a blast!! "
5051529,34933136,2015-06-14,26963270,Ann,The condo was as described and suited our needs perfectly. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. Mercy was easily available via email. The location was just right for our weekend with easy access to I-5. 
5051529,43741864,2015-08-22,7650549,Ann,"When we arrived at the building, Mercy happened to be in the parking lot which was great because we had a couple of questions that she readily answered.
The unit was as advertised.  Great for 5 adults.  Nice and clean. Although definitely not in the touristy area of Seattle, it was a great location for us.  Close to family we were visiting. The building itself is on a busy street but the unit was at the rear of the building so for the most part quiet.  There were 3 outdoor spaces.  The bedrooms and bathrooms were big.  Some places you can barely fit a bed in - not this place. Great sizes. Easy access to the I-5.  While nothing was really walkable, we didn't mind because we would get up in the morning and not get back until evening.  But even though this is Seattle, there is no Starbucks on the corner."
5051529,45364562,2015-09-02,30171081,Brigid,Everything was as described. We found the instructions and information that were given were clear and accurate. It was also very nice to have a grocery store card included in the binder.
5051529,45924515,2015-09-07,25716309,Jake,"It was clean and very comfortable! The towels, linens were fresh, the beds were comfortable. They had all the amenities in the kitchen you would need!!! It was a fantastic experience!!!"
5051529,51917973,2015-10-25,43952575,Neal,The apt/condo was really nice and clean in a good neighborhood. I loved how mercy was willing to work with us letting us check in a few hrs earlier due to our flight coming in so much earlier it was overall a great experience. 
5051529,55187305,2015-11-29,4599936,Mackenzie,"Mercy's apartment was perfect for our holiday weekend in Seattle. The apartment was roomy for 4 people and had everything we needed; it was also nice to have a parking space to leave the car. The apartment has easy highway access and check-in and check-out was easy too. 

Thanks for a great stay, Mercy! "
6105021,39430715,2015-07-23,28676146,Courtney,"We had an excellent time staying in Malcolm's loft.  The loft was perfect, very well put together, and just as described.  It was in a good location about a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle.  We really enjoyed our stay and getting to explore Seattle!"
6105021,39818696,2015-07-26,37679529,Jillian,Malcolm's loft was awesome! Very clean and organized. It has an awesome deck area with grill and hot tub. We felt right at home. The south beacon hill area is a quick drive to basically anywhere in the city. But if you're looking to stay out of the hustle and bustle Malcolm has some great local recommendations! A great place to stay!
6105021,45789510,2015-09-06,37411190,Dan,"Malcolm made us feel very welcome through the entire process as we looked toward our Seattle visit. The Beacon Hill area was perfect for us, allowing for some walking through the neighborhoods (Georgetown is less than a mile away with amazing coffee, food options; Beacon Hill itself, also solid) along with close proximity to the 36 Bus which gave us access to the Beacon Hill Link Light Rail Station.  The photos of the Loft, while stunning, really do not do the Loft justice. This place was an ideal respite and allowed us to get away while still being closely positioned to downtown Seattle. The Loft is cozy yet rustic and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We will absolutely stay in the Loft again and highly recommend Malcolm as a host. "
6105021,46594020,2015-09-12,24747173,Marisa,"Malcolm's Seattle Loft Studio is absolutely wonderful; from the gourmet kitchen to the fresh vegetable and flower garden just off the studio's private deck, the amenities are bountiful. Malcolm is a gracious host who made us feel welcomed with lots of little touches including a great cheat-sheet to enjoy the city like a local.  Not only would I recommend this Loft to anyone visiting Seattle, we will definitely be back to stay again!

Location, location, location! We were never more than 10-15 minutes away from any of the Seattle attractions or hot-spots, and were conveniently only 15 minutes away from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It felt like we were in the center of everything and anything we wanted to do, however, the serenity of Malcolm's Loft and property made us feel like we were miles away from the city hustle and bustle. 

As a neat-freak, I was very appreciative of the cleanliness, comfort and presentation of the Loft. Malcolm was very accommodating to any of our needs and made himself available to us all whilst ensuring we enjoyed our privacy and space.  Perhaps one of the best surprises about the Loft is all of the art work which includes Malcolm's stunning photography and pieces collected from around the world during his travels.  

The Seattle Studio Loft is a fantastic find in a great city!"
6105021,47383029,2015-09-18,21822600,Chrissie,"Malcolm's loft was magnificent! The place was very comfortable and we felt right at home. The loft was stocked with everything we could have needed or wanted, up to date features and a unique artistic feel. The hot tub in the garden setting was also such a treat. Malcolm was extremely kind and gave us great suggestions for places to check out while in the city. This was the best place we could have landed in Seattle! "
6105021,47685477,2015-09-21,1816516,Ivette & Christian,We absolutely loved staying in Malcolm's loft. It was a quiet and tranquil place that felt very homey and well appointed! He really nailed the details and even had a bottle of wine and a card to welcome us. Would stay here again for sure!
6105021,48420967,2015-09-26,14996710,Taylor,"After a week of camping/hiking I was pretty exhausted. I was really looking forward to my stay in Seattle at Malcolm's place and was not disappointed. Everything was exactly how it appeared in the description with some bonus amenities.  
Malcolm was extremely nice and accommodating, even in regards to silly questions and always available..I really can't say enough positives, thanks again."
6105021,48920961,2015-09-29,311715,David,"We had a great stay at Malcolm's loft! Everything was as described and the space worked out great for us. It had everything we needed and could have wanted from the full kitchen, a deck with a hot tub and felt very spacious with the high ceilings. It was also in a great location near the highway making it easy for us to get wherever we wanted to go. We would definitely recommend staying and hope we get a chance to again soon!"
6105021,49501006,2015-10-04,43734028,Casey,"What a great first experience with Airbnb! For once, the pictures were true to form. This place was nothing short of amazing. Malcolm was quick to respond to any questions we had and even recommend the perfect place for brunch, Hangry Cafe. This was a perfect getaway. Would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends! Keep the date open for next year because we will be sure to stay there again for next years Elysian Pumpkin Festival!  "
6105021,51157642,2015-10-18,1626774,Molly,"Malcolm was super helpful, even coming out to help me find the place when my GPS couldn't quite locate it (it was right down the street). The place was beautiful and he made it super easy to get in! The place is beautiful, it was a perfect place for the weekend. "
6105021,52436120,2015-10-29,20448298,Jeff,This is a GREAT space. Malcolm had a bunch of nice touches with essentials and other things including a welcome card. Parking is really easy and I-5 is a short hop away for people who need to commute around Seattle. Malcolm was very helpful and responsive. 
6105021,52728736,2015-11-01,21744257,Thao,Malcom's home was beautiful and unique. It was very well decorated and felt like a home away from home. Malcom was responsive and very nice. We would recommend this place to our friends and family during their stay in Seattle or just a weekend getaway.
6105021,53367344,2015-11-08,34687589,Erin,"The loft was a beautiful space full of bright skylights and warm colors. Great landscaping, and a clear, easy path for guests to walk past the owners house and into the loft was much appreciated. Super cute space, the owner left a nice note and bottle of wine. Thankful for the parking space out front. Glad to have chosen this spot, overall great experience. "
6105021,54003634,2015-11-15,16721279,Astrellita,"Malcolm's property is simply one of the nicest / cleanest accommodations I've ever rented. The fine attention to details, exquisite decor and lovely wine upon arrival really made it a special experience despite the windy rain outside. Highly recommended! "
6105021,55109658,2015-11-28,2918384,William,"Malcolm was excellent as a host, and the place was exactly as described.  It's a very cool studio in the back of his property with plenty of space and privacy for a couple.  When we arrived, Malcolm greeted us and we were happily on our own from there.  We have no problem recommending this rental to others!

"
6105021,56442973,2015-12-13,50315782,Chris,"Malcolm was a great host. I found his place at the last minute after a reservation with a different host fell through. Malcolm answered my request promptly and gave me all the info I needed to arrive and settle in. The lift itself is great. Plenty of room for just myself, and more than enough for a few people. Everything is well designed and in great working condition. I felt very comfortable during my stay. I will look forward to staying here again and I will recommend this to anyone I know who is visiting Seattle."
6105021,56916921,2015-12-20,15198345,Ciera,"The loft was exactly as listed and even better in person than in the pictures. It was cozy, and Malcolm was a great host. Easy to find and easy to access. We loved our stay and will definitely be back again for a little getaway!"
6105021,57513996,2015-12-27,24258332,Arlin,We have a wonderful time at your place. We were able to hang all day with family here. We made brunch and crafts and watched an old Star Wars movie. Great time had by all. We all agreed that the place is really cool. You have done a great job and I wish many happy years of Airbnb. Thanks again. Dean and Arlin Crane
9615941,57811727,2015-12-29,4060776,Jane,Matt was very professional with his quick responses and good information.  The description of his listing is accurate and completely met all my needs.  He is friendly and accommodating.  I would stay there again and definitely would recommend it.
8193054,47844197,2015-09-21,22883855,Lindsey,"This Airbnb was absolutely perfect and as described. Clean and in a quiet location in a new high rise. The proximity to the heart of the business district + Market and the eastern side of Cap Hill made walking to dinner and shops a breeze. Sarah is a great, informative host. I'll definitely keep this bnb on my return listing."
8193054,49146672,2015-10-01,799015,Ben & Tori,"Sarah's apartment is exquisite. The building is clean and modern, and the apartment is very comfortable with an amazing view. The roof deck is also worth a trip. I was attending a conference at the convention center and it is a two minute walk. There's also a great coffee shop right near by. Definitely a great stay."
8193054,50857883,2015-10-15,1494670,Suzanne,"This is a lovely vacation rental in an ultra-modern building with all the latest conveniences. A super comfortable bed, a breathtaking view, a gorgeous rooftop deck with lounge chairs, and all in the heart of downtown Seattle with plenty of shops and restaurants within steps. Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient and we would definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle."
8193054,51472181,2015-10-20,25648486,Amy,One of the best Airbnb experiences to date! This space is spectacular and located in the best part of Seattle. The views took my breath away and the modern finishes were decedent. I cannot wait to come back. 
8193054,52131525,2015-10-26,34477527,Steven,Sarah was a great host. Very generous and answered all questions very quickly. The apartment is beautiful with great views and very close to everything downtown. We will definitely go back next time we are in Seattle. 
8193054,52601213,2015-10-31,571368,Nick,"The directions were clear and easy to follow, the space was clean and tidy and was exactly what I expected based on the photos & description of the place. The view and location were great and it's a very secure place which is nice. Sarah was also flexible with me when i needed more time to check out. This is a great place!"
8193054,53215927,2015-11-06,9298257,Matt,"The building was great, and the space was wonderful! We especially enjoyed how clean and quiet the apt is. I travel to Seattle often and will definitely stay here again. "
8193054,53481721,2015-11-09,22861104,David,This part of town has some great places to eat at/chill and all around a great area.
8193054,54456110,2015-11-20,42017859,John,"Excellent experience.  Sarah's directions were clear, apartment was clean, quiet, and had a very excellent view.  Very comfortable stay, great location, 5 stars."
8193054,54893871,2015-11-25,47720622,Nicole,Great stay! Sarah answered all my questions before my trip. Unit was clean and felt just like home. I would definitely stay here again! 
9910025,58254374,2016-01-01,43825026,Jessica,"Arthur's house was even nicer than the pictures! He was a great host, especially for my first air bnb renting experience! The house was clean, convenient, and easy to get to. He provided everything I needed for my stay and I would highly recommend his place. Thank you for everything Arthur!"

5240694,30835504,2015-04-27,1326282,Daniel,"This is a really wonderful place, it was clearly set up with guests in mind. It is a small place, but it has great private spaces, and feels spacious, with very tall ceilings and an open setup. It has brand new appliances, including a great gas stove, and a washer/drier. This is a great neighborhood, very close to downtown or I90, and easy walking distance to restaurants, coffee, the PCC market, and Seward Park. Anthony is a great host, very flexible in terms of meeting, who was helpful, with great communication. I will definitely be staying here again!"
5240694,31906034,2015-05-11,30484516,Tina,Anthony made us feel very welcome. The place was quiet. It was nice to have laundry and cooking facilities while we stayed.The neighborhood is very safe and quiet as well as beautiful.
5240694,32206086,2015-05-15,28426282,Mel,"Anthony's place is definitely a fun place to stay when in the Seattle area! The place itself provides many hours of entertainment with board games/pool/campfire! The loft may seem small when you walk in, but can comfortably house a large number of people. Highly recommend staying in this funky loft!"
5240694,32661161,2015-05-19,22303758,Danwei,"Very lovely house just beside their own. They said on the website they only have one bedroom, but we found two more beds and a folded sofa, which was brilliant for us! Anthony and his son Tracy have been soooooo nice to us throughout our stay and we really appreciate their kindness and hospitality! Thank you very much! We did enjoy our stay~"
5240694,34478016,2015-06-08,18059717,Ryan,"Our host Anthony was the greatest! He welcomed my 8yr old son and I upon arrival and made us feel welcome and right at home.  We exchanged a number of text messages prior to arrival, so communication was top notch from the get-go.  The accomodations we perfect, spacious and warm, beds were like the Four Seasons.  We slept with windows open, fans on and didn't hear a noise outside and the temperature was ideal in the place.  (It was in the mid 80's during the day, but the space remained cool and well ventilated.)  The pool was refreshing, clean and lounge chairs and towels were right there.  The neighborhood is great.  PCC Market is close for provisions, I-5 is easy to get to and a number of surface streets will get you downtown in 20 minutes or so w/ views of the lake and city life instead of the tail lights in front of you on the freeway.  We will most definitely be staying here again and would recommend this place to friends to aunts and uncles.  Well done Anthony!"
5240694,36711850,2015-06-30,2852154,Coral,"Anthony was very welcoming even though we didn't actually get to meet him. He was super responsive to text messages - like within minutes. He gave us great brunch recommendations!!

The unit looks exactly how it looks in the pictures - super fun and cozy. We appreciated the air conditioner because it happened to be over 90 degrees and homes in Seattle don't usually  have AC. You will be amazing with the craftsmanship in the place. Super creative and good use of space!

The neighborhood is nice and quiet. There are cafes, grocery stores, and restaurants within walking distance. If you don't like to walk, you can usually find a Car2Go within a few blocks. We didn't use the pool, but there's a POOL! 

We would totally stay here again!"
5240694,38407594,2015-07-15,33329647,Kath,We were excited to stay here from just looking at the pictures and it did not disappoint. This is a wonderful and fun place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and is conveniently located about 15-20 minutes from all the places we visited in Seattle. The loft is small but feels spacious and is designed in a way to make good use of all the space. Anthony responded to messages very quickly. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this place.
5240694,41336802,2015-08-07,32778196,Keith,My Host made us feel welcome. He showed me around and was kind and helpful. 
5240694,44523689,2015-08-27,13795111,Dorothy,"Very accurate listing.  It's a friendly, eclectic, unique place--the dÃ©cor is part tree house, part bordello-that can sleep up to eight people.  There's only one bathroom, but the plumbing is great.  Two bridesmaids, a family friend, and myself-it worked out fine.  Anthony was very responsive, the place is clean and well-equipped--good bathroom, full kitchen, master bedroom-- and the location is great.  Walking distance to Columbia City and the Loop, one door away from a view of the lake.   One caveat--going up and down the ladders and the high bathtub might not be safe for very young children and challenging for anyone with physical limitations.  I would definitely go back, especially for a family or group event."
5240694,46493706,2015-09-11,23358021,Joel,The place was great and had a wonderful view of the lake at the end of the road.  Anthony was a very welcoming host and was super kind about the breaking of a wine glass.  
5240694,47839970,2015-09-21,10320128,Jana,Fantastic place with great style and very cozy feel!  Anthony was a gracious host and very quick to respond to inquiries.  The hot tub was a lovely treat.  All around positive! 
5240694,48764932,2015-09-28,22122182,Anjali,"I stayed in the Airy loft overlooking seward park in September '15 with 4 other friends. The place is cozy unique and beautifully decorated. I like how Anthony has built the place himself and used the available space. He is a great host and has some good tips for things to do in Seattle. He also let us use his bath tub, which was a lot of fun.
Overall a great experience. I would stay here again. "
5240694,51073017,2015-10-17,45734082,Jessica,This loft was very clean with most amenities and creative decor. The space was very airy and comfortable. I was here for a week on business and felt the location was very quiet as well. Only a short drive to downtown Seattle with fun smaller city area nearby. Note the floors are concrete for those who get cold feet :)
5240694,54641781,2015-11-22,44668247,Candice,"What an amazing place ! Anthony was very kind, warm, welcoming and very helpful anytime I needed. Everything you need is right at your finger tips... I truly enjoyed his space and the beautiful location in Seward Park. He even let me leave my mark on the wall (painted a mural) which many will be able to see during their stay. Thanks again for such an awesome experience!"
5240694,58046288,2015-12-31,6274029,Belle,Anthony was great. The place was as described. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Would definitely stay again.
5977556,30259775,2015-04-19,12163923,Timothy,I enjoyed my stay at Susan's house.  Very clean and nice room & bathroom/shower with real comfortable bed.  A side benefit is a small kitchen with microwave and coffee maker.  Susan is a most gracious host.   Very close to Volunteer Park and the cool Capital Hill neighborhood.  I definately recommend.
5977556,30531949,2015-04-23,11023450,Jessika,"Such a delight. The photos provided were on point! The bed and bathroom linens provided were luxurious. Bed is very comfortable. The shower was so perfect I didn't want to get out. The space is very large and perfect temp at all times. Lovely chat with Susan but she gave me the desired privacy. I'm already going to book again w/ her, that's how pleased I am. "
5977556,30727900,2015-04-26,7597127,Emily,Clean and spacious room in a beautiful neighborhood. Susan was a gracious and accommodating host.

5977556,31687174,2015-05-08,32291771,Alexandra,"Susan's private unit is the perfect place to stay while in Seattle!  It has everything you will need, the bed is perfection, the shower is even better.  Susan is incredibly welcoming and accommodating.  She requires nothing from her guests other than basic respect for her lovely home.  Thanks Susan! "
5977556,31745160,2015-05-09,20096450,Luci,"Susan was a wonderful host with a very cool basement space in the coolest neighborhood! Our trip was non stop with activity and Susan made checking in and out effortless. I wish we had MORE time at her actual place.. it was SO CLEAN. like, kick it with your bare feet clean! it had everything we could need including a couple chocolate (email hidden)ce touch. For not being too familiar with the area(and I had done a little pre-search for the trip) and Seattle in general, the place is in Capitol Hill which was walking distance to all things cool (parks, bars, food, record store) or a quick drive (or walk) to downtown(pike place, space needle etc)  HIGHLY recommend! Thank you again, Susan :)"
5977556,31842321,2015-05-10,15149924,Jennifer,"Susan's place was wonderful!  The location, comfort, privacy, and amenities were perfect.  I would love to stay there anytime I'm visiting Seattle. "
5977556,32082631,2015-05-13,32353482,Joshua,Susan was great! The unit was perfect for what I was looking for. No complaints here!
5977556,32270804,2015-05-16,1387813,Matthew,Staying with Susan was fantastic.  She was completely responsive throughout the reservation process and her home is lovely.  The space was perfect; it was private and the bed was extremely comfortable.  I absolutely would stay there again the next time I am in Seattle.  
5977556,32703653,2015-05-20,20315637,Kevin,"Susan was very communicative throughout my first airbnb process and I was pleasantly surprised of her attentiveness. Greeted us when we got in and gave us a tour and instructions on the place. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom flawless, and coffee and milk was available. Other than the TV having to be unplugged after use and WiFi going out on the second day (I probably could have communicated to her that it was out and she would have fixed it but didn't want to bother her since it was late), we thoroughly enjoyed our stay given all the amenities, proximity to restaurants, and Susan's hospitality."
5977556,33268138,2015-05-26,1326812,Richard,"She was very welcoming special snacks, cheese, crackers and a bottle of wine awaiting us."
5977556,34000333,2015-06-03,29820147,Haemin,Susan was very nice and kind. The location and everything about the place was perfect! 
5977556,34639913,2015-06-10,17382599,Suzanne,"Even though we were late due to the airline losing one of our bags, Susan met us at the house and made us feel right at home. The living area was very clean and nicely appointed.  The shower head was amazing!  She even stocked my favorite brand and variety of tea.
We were very comfortable and will book with Susan again if we get the opportunity.  I highly recommend Susan's Capitol Hill apartment. "
5977556,34953605,2015-06-14,31116549,Amy,"Susan was an amazing host! Our flight came in a bit late in the day, but she was incredibly accommodating and waited up for our arrival. The space is very neat, clean and modern. The location is central and within 10 minutes of pretty much everything. Would highly recommend!"
5977556,35307023,2015-06-17,25207443,Nhi,Susan was very welcoming and the room was very clean and well maintained. She has a beautiful home and is located near all the shops and Volunteer Park. Highly recommend! 
5977556,35667435,2015-06-21,32624335,Judith,"Susan was waiting in her front yard for us, and showed us to our suite-for-the-day.  It was just as described on Airbnb, private, sweet, well supplied with the necessities, such as a great bed, as well as some extras, such as coffee (!).  The best part of the experience is it's proximity to ""downtown"" Capitol Hill, a charming neighborhood with lovely restaurants, beautiful flowers everywhere and great people-watching.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been better.  Thanks, Susan!"
5977556,36021013,2015-06-24,14454067,Michaela,"This is a spacious, airy, well-equipped private suite with a terrific shower and a comfy bed in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood. It is also close to plenty of action. There were shops (many of them for coffee, this being Seattle), parks, and restaurants within easy walking distance. We felt like residents instead of visitors. Our host was accommodating and welcoming. "
5977556,36274435,2015-06-27,31427865,Chelsey,"Located in a beautiful neighborhood in Capitol Hill within walking distance of lots of cool restaurants/bars and a block away from a nice park. We were there when Pride was going on, so it was a pretty happening place to be, but Susan's place is on a quiet street with lots of pretty old houses. The place itself was very clean, the bed was super comfortable, and the shower was really nice. No complaints!"
5977556,36675507,2015-06-30,32537933,Jeremy,"Just as described and nicely positioned for downtown treks, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Susan's.  It was just what we were looking for - far enough outside of the main part of the city, while also close enough to walk - only once did we take a cab over the three days we were there.  The living area was more than enough to serve as a great jump-off point for a very fun city.  Susan welcomed us and we had no doubt she'd be there to help with any of our needs - we'd most certainly have it on the top of our list for future Seattle stays.  Thanks!"
5977556,36771254,2015-07-01,2260219,Anna,Susan's place is in a very nice neighborhood close to a park and a nice shopping street with good restaurants.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and has all the amenities we needed for our brief stay.  
5977556,37966145,2015-07-12,3998733,Beth,Susan was out of town but left detailed instructions about the listing. 
5977556,38470466,2015-07-15,36447764,Brian,"Great place, Susan was very welcoming. You get nearly the entire lower floor so it is as if getting your own private place."
5977556,40085636,2015-07-28,31546735,Louie,"Walking into the unit, it was obvious that the pictures and the description of the unit were spot on. The unit was clean, the bed was comfortable, and refreshments were available. The neighborhood was very quiet, safe, and walkable. The distance to Lake Union and Downtown were both short and a pleasant walk. We had the pleasure of meeting Susan briefly and she was nice and a great host. We would highly recommend staying at Susan's home. "
5977556,40314087,2015-07-30,251479,Laura,"Susan was a very responsive host, even when not at home.  The apartment was bright, spotless, beautifully appointed and spacious; it was easy to forget it was a basement.  She had thoughtfully stocked the refrigerator and left coffee for us. The neighborhood is beautiful and one of the best in Seattle. We loved being temporary residents of Capitol Hill, at Susan's house.  Would do it again."
5977556,40905199,2015-08-03,10823138,John,"Susan's place was the ideal choice for our first visit to Seattle, and we highly recommend it. Capitol Hill has some wonderful restaurants & Elliots Bookstore is a short walk from here. Our place is quiet & cozy and convenient to the city."
5977556,42834489,2015-08-16,8920845,Matthew,"Cozy, clean and comfortable basement hideaway on a leafy, quiet street just steps away from all the action on Capitol Hill -- couldn't ask for a better location!  Susan was helpful and quick to respond via text. Highly recommended as a home base for Capitol Hill, downtown Seattle and beyond. "
5977556,45065879,2015-08-31,20607506,David,"Susan has a lovely 2-story home with a finished basement in Capitol Hill, Seattle. You enter through a side-door with a keyless entry. Inside the ceilings are about 6'7"" high with a tiled living room, kitchenette with Microwave, Sink, Dishes, and Flatware, plus a Refrigerator in the unfinished section of the basement (which came in very useful for leftovers). Sometimes the house upstairs is rented out separately and while you can hear footsteps on occasion it really wasn't too bad. The bed was made with plenty of pillows and I slept soundly every night. The room was also equipped with a TV but I didn't turn it on as I was gone most of the day. UBER had no problem finding the address when I needed to go downtown. I would recommend staying at Susan's home if you're ever in the need!"
5977556,45399660,2015-09-02,39839848,Jane,"Great time in Seattle, wonderful place and great accomodation. Susan place is so homely- we felt very comfortable and looked after. The location was perfect for exploring Seattle and the trendy area of Capitol Hill! We had just competed hood to coast so having access to a washing machine was another great touch! Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to explore Seattle! "
5977556,46728652,2015-09-13,39147737,Marco,"Susan's home on Capitol Hill was a perfect base to explore Seattle. The location is near bus stop to center an near the main street in Capitol Hill with lots of cafes, bars, grocery store and so on. Susan's home ist perfect for AirBnB newbies because you have your own place with bathroom, kitchen and fridge. We liked this place and can absolutely recommend it!"
5977556,48610938,2015-09-27,34361717,Pat N Mary,Susan was there to greet me and show me the apartment. The apartment was very spacious and clean and right on edge of Capital Hill. The neighborhood was gorgeous and it made me feel at home and only a couple 100 yards away was the local hot spots. Susan respected my privacy and was a fantastic host! I would stay there again. 
5977556,49625308,2015-10-05,8233149,Alison,"Susan made us feel very welcome. She was also extremely helpful to us during our stay. She is a wonderful host. The location of her lovely house is fabulous. It's a quick walk to some wonderful restaurants, and the street itself is leafy and peaceful. We had the basement apartment, which had been nicely done up. The bathroom and kitchen areas were pleasant. The towels were fluffy and the linens were like new. "
5977556,51491379,2015-10-20,46099957,Katherine,"We enjoyed out stay. Lovely location, great bed, easy access & most important parking if you need it."
5977556,51928094,2015-10-25,39550176,Ben,"The house was quiet and the bed was comfy. Shower was very warm. My girlfriend and I were out wandering around town and spent little time in the place, but were quite happy with it overall.

The location is absolutely amazing -- we were within easy walking distance of great coffee, food, and bars. There were a ton of great views and small streets to wander down. We came to Seattle to explore, and Susan's home was the perfect home base."
5977556,53782998,2015-11-12,11237835,Nick,Great
5977556,54582958,2015-11-22,43710395,Kelly,"I stayed in Susan's private unit in the basement of her beautifull home in Capitol Hill when I was visiting Seattle for a job interview. Susan was extremely helpfull giving me directions on how to get to the location of my interview and gave usefull recommendations for nice shops and restaurants close by. Capitol Hill is very hip and vibrant! The unit is only a few blocks away from Broadway which is full of great shops and close to public transportation that will take you to the downtown area.
The unit was clean, cosy and comfortable! I would recommend Susans place whenever you're visiting Seattle for a few days and want to stay in this gorgeous neighborhood."
2630912,43261760,2015-08-18,38052110,Jiajing,"Trish is a great and friendly host. She had our two rooms ready for us and answered the questions we had very patiently. The two bedrooms and bathroom were all clean and well put together when we got there. Trish also provided shower essentials, which made the stay easier! Location and the commute to I-5 are easy. Overall awesome stay, we enjoyed it! "
882274,3473940,2013-02-04,4746138,Cassia,"This was a great place to stay in. It was located in a prime area where I can walk to coffee shops, stores, and restaurants. Nick was a great host! He always responded to my questions almost immediately. The place is clean and there are tons of heater in the room. It was also really cool that Nick has Roku. Overall I would definitely go back again when I'm visiting Seattle."
882274,3490882,2013-02-06,2448974,Stephanie,Nick was very flexible and great to work with. The condo was great for the price and easy to get to places.  Thanks Nick! 
882274,3523275,2013-02-11,1996365,Melanie,"It was a great place to stay! Very good and prompt communication with the host, the place was nice and clean and in a really good location right at the bottom of capitol hill a few blocks above downtown. Really easy access to public transportation and just 1 block off of pike/pine corridor. "
882274,3552248,2013-02-16,4590682,Nathan,"  Location, location, location! This sweet little apartment is perched at the corner of Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle. The apartment itself, located in a secure building, was cute, clean and perfect for my boyfriend and I. The space is huge for one, great for two and equipped for three (the couch in the living room folds out). Nick was so easy to communicate with in the weeks leading up to our trip, quick to respond to inquiries and pleasant to work with. We were met and let in by Nicole, as Nick was unavailable. We didn't have to call them for anything during our stay, but they were always available to us, just in case. 
   I cannot stress the awesome-ness of the location enough- surrounded by cafes, bars and restaurants, a block away from major bus lines,  and gorgeous views everywhere you turn. We were so busy taking advantage of all the great things to do, we basically just slept, showered and geared up for the day at the apartment.
   Do yourself a solid and visit The Pine Box, a sweet bar with pizza oven, located 20 seconds away from home.
   (The building is near the freeway, so if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs.)
     Thanks Nick and Nicole- we'll be back! (in the friendly 'we enjoyed our stay' way, not the Terminator way!) "
882274,3602556,2013-02-22,1554681,Vera,"You can easily walk to downtown from this place and also the neighbourhood, Capitol Hill, is fun to explore! Nicole and Nick were both very helpful and immediately responded when we had questions. "
882274,3627310,2013-02-26,4961378,M. Dillon,"We ha a wonderful stay at Nicks Apartment in Seattle. It was a great location and we had everything we needed. Close to all the great neighbourhoods and much cheaper than trying to find a hotel. Even when the fuse didn't work Nick was quick to fix it which was great! All in all Id recommend it for anyone laid back who wants a cozy stay that is affordable and close to all the great spots in downtown Seattle. Making our way back to the airport was a breeze as well! 

Thanks Nick :) "
882274,3673280,2013-03-02,5215249,Rosie,"Super clean, GREAT location, steps to great bars and restaurants but safe and quiet building. Perfect for one person or a couple. The bed was SUPER comfortable. Nicole, who takes care of check-in, was very friendly and is around if you have any questions. This was my first Air BandB experience and I will definitely be back! "
882274,3676483,2013-03-03,11912170,Clay,Nicky's place is in a great location and everything about using the space was easy. It's pretty basic accommodations but clean and equipped. The manger was great to work with although I didn't meet her. 
882274,3737702,2013-03-10,1552568,Eric,"They were very helpful and provided a clean place to stay. My girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle with no car, and this was a perfect location to walk or use public transportation all around the city (including to/from the airport)."
882274,3773382,2013-03-13,2658212,James,"I throughly enjoyed staying at Nick's listing.  It put me in a fantastic spot in Capitol Hill close to great food, great coffee and night life.  This would be the first listing I look at when I go back to Seattle."
882274,3853060,2013-03-21,4872927,Jedidiah,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the location of this apartment is spectacular.  Comfy bed, well-equipped kitchen, and TV with Netflix! Accommodations were exactly as described, and Nicole was very responsive with any questions we had."
882274,3883261,2013-03-24,3073674,Luiz,Pretty good place and help from the manager! All worked perfect and it was right next to the convention center... a bunch of cool little restaurants and cafes right by your door steps... def recommend!  
882274,3936981,2013-03-29,4658643,Teiko,"If you only care about location, then this place is great because it is right next to the bar, club, and restaurant scene and a very short walk away from downtown. They were also flexible for letting us check in early, however the apartment is much dirtier than it looks in the pictures. There is mold on the wall and they didn't clean or vacuum anything before we checked in, so I actually would have rather waited until they cleaned everything thoroughly than check in early to a dirty apartment. There also was no extra blankets for the sofa bed, but to be fair we also didn't try to call and ask if they had one either."
882274,4001889,2013-04-02,421821,Justin,"My friend and I had a great stay, The place was clean well stocked kitchen, is close to restaurants, and a short walk to the convention place definitely recommend."
882274,4137404,2013-04-13,5064491,James,Great place! I got it for my grandparents for a couple days stay and they were very happy with the accommodations. 
882274,4182641,2013-04-16,2916978,Patrick,"I stayed at 304 last weekend with a friend who flew into town. The apartment was absolutely perfect for our needs.

The location is incredible, nestled on the edge of Capitol Hill, close to cafes, bars and coffee shops. At the same time it only took us about 20 minutes to walk to the waterfront downtown. We parked on melrose and didn't have any issues.

The apartment isn't huge, but for the two of us it was fine. The bed was very comfortable, and even though the place is right off I-5 neither of us had trouble sleeping with the window cracked open. I can't say we had any complaints about the place.

After putting in my request to book Nick got back to me within an hour. We didn't get to meet him personally, but Nicole was easy to work with, available and accommodating. 

If you are 2-3 people I'd definitely recommend staying at Melrose Court.

"
882274,4204524,2013-04-18,2326346,Maria Cristina,"I only stayed a night but my stay was great -- even if I arrived late (12 midnight) and had trouble getting the locks to open, Nicole was easy to reach and patiently helped me get in. If I get a chance to visit Seattle again, I would definitely recommend this place!"
882274,4319342,2013-04-27,1753586,Ikeogu,It was a nice experience. The place was safe and the distance was cool with me (all within walking distance to the downtown attractions and the nightlife). The parking situation was terrible though (I had to pay for parking on one day and and took 30 minutes to find free parking on the second day). Nick & Nicole were very cool people and easily accessible during the whole trip being perfect  hosts.  I'd recommend this place with anyone. They will have everything ready right for you and even recommend places to go in the area.
882274,4400107,2013-05-02,808994,Samuel,"Our stay at Melrose Court was very pleasant. The location was excellent - close to the vibrant cafes, eateries and shops of Capitol Hill, and a short walk to downtown Seattle.
Our hosts were very attentive, thorough and flexible, and left us all the information we needed to make our short stay in Seattle a rewarding one!
Thanks again, we'll be back!"
882274,4519214,2013-05-10,86970,Jesse,"Checking in and leaving was effortless and streamlined, this was perfect for a short trip to Seattle. It was well equipped and would have been suitable for much longer-term stays. The location is excellent for work activities downtown and also for enjoying the nightlife and restaurants of Capitol Hill. 

"
882274,4534798,2013-05-11,5940706,Steve,perfect little place in the ideal location. This will be our new home when in Seattle. 
882274,4569660,2013-05-13,5697549,Hao,"Good location and easy to access, you may take some time to find the street parking but normally free, apartment is a little older than expect but is worth the price. 

It is recommended."
882274,4607383,2013-05-14,869773,Andrew,"A very conveniently located, no-frills apartment. Clean and comfortable. The price can't be beat for the location!"
882274,4675063,2013-05-20,5258664,Nicole,"Nick's apartment was a great place to crash after long days of tourist activities and bar hopping.  Nick and Nicole were great at following-up with me before/during/after my stay.  It was my first time using airbnb and both Nick and Nicole made it a smooth experience.  
The best part about the apartment was the location.  The Lightrail was within reasonable walking distance and there are excellent bars/nightlife yards from the apartment.  "
882274,4730377,2013-05-22,3003281,Jeff,Two friends and I stayed here for one night in May.  We arrived earlier than expected and Nicole (who works with Nick) offered to let us pick up our keys and drop off our bags early - so helpful!  Heading in to our stay the communication was great and once there Nicole was a treat to deal with had us all in smiles.  I wouldn't say this is five star accomodations but for the location and the price I really don't think it could be beat.  The spaces were clean and had everything we needed.  Located within walking distance to both downtown and Capitol Hill it really is the best of both worlds.  For only having one day in the city we covered a lot of ground thanks to this place.
882274,4832282,2013-05-28,5644761,Heather,"We had a wonderful stay at Melrose Court.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed working with Nick and Nicole after we made our reservation and while on our trip.  

The apartment is part of a a larger building with the apartment doors opening into a courtyard with beautiful trees.  Access to the building is restricted to one central door.

Prior to our arrival, we set up a time to meet with Nicole and get the keys and a tour.  Unfortunately, she was unavailable when we arrived but made sure that we had access to the keys (lock box) and knew how to get in.  This made check out a breeze as well.

The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance of both downtown and capital hill. (It was a great place to stay for Camp Jitterbug.)  The binder in the living had good descriptions of things to do in Seattle and good places to eat. 

We enjoyed our stay!

"
882274,4937777,2013-06-03,5762067,Heath,Nicks's place is perfectly located within a 10 minute walk of downtown and close to many other amenities in Capitol Hill. It was clean and tidy with everything required so I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
882274,4973546,2013-06-04,6548315,Sean,"Easy stay, centralized."
882274,4990226,2013-06-05,6675928,Meghan,"The apartment was just what I needed for a short, one night stay. Clean, in a nice location, and Nick and Nicole were great about responding quickly and keeping me updated (I was able to check-in early, which was super helpful). Had a great time!"
882274,5225124,2013-06-19,4957199,Shiyun,"The location is ideal, within walking distance to Pike Place and other central places. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the station of ""Convention Place"" and a little bit longer to ""Westlake""(both are big stations) where we board buses to different  destinations, as well as the LightRail to the airport. 
The apartment has everything we need. Nicole is nice,  friendly and very helpful. Very easy to communicate with. Seattle was our last stop in the whole trip and our choice of the apartment was so right :)"
882274,5286169,2013-06-22,5416060,David,"Nick's Melrose Court 304 is a small but reasonably comfortable 1 bedroom unit, next to downtown Seattle at the western edge of Capitol Hill. Location-wise it doesn't get much better -- convenient to energetic Broadway, trendy Pike-Pine corridor, and nouveau upscale South Lake Union.

First off, the service was excellent. There are multiple points of contact in case you need anything. They were very flexible on check-in time when my timetable unexpectedly moved up by a few hours.

The basics -- kitchen, appliances, bath fixtures -- were clean. I would have preferred if all surfaces and furniture had been dusted, but I did arrive early. The only basics that could said to be lacking were a kitchen recycling bin and icecube trays.

Kitchen and bedroom appear to have been outfitted from Ikea, which was very nice. Clock radio. Stove with oven; drip coffeemaker; cutlery. No microwave.

The living room has used but good condition sofa, upholstered chair, desk, a 24-26"" CRT television with Roku box, and DSL wi-fi.

Bedroom and livingroom have been updated with laminate flooring. The bedroom closet doubles as storage for the unit and really ought to have a door instead of a curtain, but that's probably the responsibility of the building management and not Nick.

Security-wise the building felt safe. I found the lock on the main entrance to be a little tricky, but I suppose that makes it even more resistant to break-ins. I should note (as a lifelong resident of Seattle until 2012) the neighborhood is one of my favorites in town, and I rate it quite safe.

In summary, while the building dates from the early Sixties, 304 is in good shape, and Nick and his helpers do an admirable job. I definitely recommend Melrose Court 304 to others."
882274,5365072,2013-06-26,4130185,Tanya,"Had a lovely stay at Nick's place this past weekend! We were there for a music festival and were there mainly to sleep, so the no-frills apartment suited our needs. The location couldn't be better and we were able to find parking in the neighborhood for our rental car. Nicole was a great liaison and was easily reachable by phone. She was also very helpful during the reservation process and even helped us figure out which bus routes we needed to take during our visit. 
There were 2 things that kept me from giving this place a 5 star review - 1) the internet connection was poor. We were hardly ever able to connect the roku box which was frustrating. 2) There's no door on the bedroom, which made having our 3rd guest awkward. If I had known there wasn't a door I might not have had a 3rd person, but since it's a 1br how could I have known? There's also no AC which is standard in Seattle (we were able to keep the place pretty cool) but this week it's going to be in the 90s and that could make it tough for some renters during the summer.
Overall I would/already have recommended this place to people sightseeing in Seattle. It is a comfortable crash pad, the service was friendly and nearly all of our needs were met. We will stay again if we come back! "
882274,5395952,2013-06-28,6241108,Jackie,Apt is a bit dated. Had trouble with key opening front door to enter complex. Nicole communicated well. Apt was clean. Not sure I would return. 
882274,5690696,2013-07-12,5799447,Pat,"I stayed for 11 days and found the apartment to be just as advertised; very convenient location, WiFi was fast and secure.  Nick and Nicole were excellent hosts, they answered all my questions promptly and were friendly and professional.  It was apparent they were well practiced on taking care of the property and their guests."
882274,5713711,2013-07-13,354114,Dan,The apartment was great for my needs. It was clean and conveniently located. The host made check-in and check-out very easy. I'd definitely stay again!
882274,5905809,2013-07-22,5862766,Kevin,"I stayed at Nicks place July 19th for a quick weekend road trip. The apartment was centrally located, and I was able to walk to Pike Place Maket, the EMP Museum, and all the great Bars and Restaurants on Capital Hill.

I was initially concerned with parking, but found a free site just north on Denny on the overpass in front of a few apartment complexes. Otherwise you will need to drive East on Pine to look for one of the paid parking sites. 

The apartment is in an older building, with a few young/hip tenants. It was great to use as a base for exploring the Hill & (website hidden) Bar was a great Thai restaurant for dinner, Skillet was a great Breakfast place with awesome Bloody Mary's, and the Pony Bar with it's outside Patio was a lively gay/mixed bar with plenty to see.

As this was my first AirBNB stay it turned out to be a pleasant experience. Thanks!"
882274,6242273,2013-08-05,6875340,Rebecca,"My friends and I stayed at Nick's apartment for a weekend. Nick and Nicole were very good hosts and answered any questions my friends and I had in a timely manner. The apartment is a little dated but clean and fit three of us comfortably. The apartment is in a great looking. It is walking distance from Pike Place/the downtown area, Seattle Center, and everything else we went to see- no public transportation needed!"
882274,6455919,2013-08-13,6276377,Diana,"The apartment was on Capitol Hill and really close to a bus stop that can take you downtown,  less than 5 minutes walk to the stop. It was in a quiet area and walkable distance to a lot of good food places. We were out most of the day and were only back past midnight and left early in the morning but we never had to deal with any loud noises from the neighbors or from the street. Conveniently situated close to the freeway but it wasn't necessary for us as we took public transportation the whole week. Parking did seem difficult to find in that area though. The unit was clean and had everything we needed for our trip. For the price and location, it can't be beat. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
882274,6727770,2013-08-23,881918,Lori,"Great location!  Nick was super responsive and helpful.  Would recommend to anyone!

Thanks!"
882274,6769535,2013-08-24,2246221,Markus,"I only stayed at Nick's for one night.  The place was extremely convenient (right off the freeway, and close to bars, downtown, ect.) and it was clean and quiet.  Great spot if you're in town and need a spot to rest your head!"
882274,6891059,2013-08-29,6773607,Nicolas,"The experience was good overall, the place has a great location and the apt is very comfortable. Also the availability of a good Wi Fi connection is a definitely a plus. The problem is the cleanliness. I understand that the concept here is that each guest leave the place clean, but you can't expect guests to remove the dust from the furnitures or make a deep clean in the bathroom. For us, it was a bit shocking find the bathroom so dirty... looks like it wasn't cleaned in weeks! Me and my wife needed about an hour of cleaning to felt comfortable. 

As an advice to Nick, I think that is really important that you consider a deep clean at least once a week.

We had a very good stay in the apt anyway, but I think this matter definitely has to be revised for future guests."
882274,7005600,2013-09-03,4377904,Eric,"Great location for this apartment, 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. Place was clean and I was given clear instructions on how to grab the key to gain access to the apartment on my own.

I've seen bigger kitchens, if your main goal is to cook for yourself, it offers most things you'd need, though the stove has seen better days.

Recommended."
882274,7296883,2013-09-14,8607329,Dave,"Awesome location - can walk to so much!  We walked to Pike's Market, tons of restaurants, coffee shops, pubs and shopping. Parking was free but you just had to find a spot.  As others have said - not the cleanest place but so conveniently located and the price was great that we overlooked that."
882274,7324650,2013-09-16,5590682,Sarajane,"Location, size and amenities were great but the place could definitely use a deep cleaning.  We were hoping to do more cooking but the kitchen was lacking. Nicole was nice and even let us store our luggage before check-in.  Would recommend for people who will be out a lot."
882274,7573654,2013-09-24,738960,Amber,"We stayed one night at Nick's place, using the lock box to get in so we never met anyone. That was easy and painless. Unfortunately we chose the apartment specifically because it said there was laundry, not realizing that that meant ""at the complex"", not ""in the apartment"". We were quite disappointed as we'd been out backpacking and had lots of laundry to do, but were too tired to track down the facility and sit there waiting. Also, parking was definitely tricky (as advertised) - we arrived on a Sunday night and ended up quite a ways away -- if thats an issue for you I'd suggset somewhere else. The apartment was fine, with a nice big bed and everything we needed for that one night - close to a lot of fun things, too. If you're not looking for anything fancy and are on foot, this would be a good place to crash while visiting."
882274,7618680,2013-09-27,3961346,Katlie,"Location is perfect, very convenience to all places we planned for visiting in the city. Also very easy to find, we found it's easier to follow the PINE street instead of the PIKE street as instructed though.
Nicole, who's taking care of the place is very helpful and response to our request very quickly.
The cleanness of the place is fairly OK, although the couch can really use some wash.
Overall, the place is a very good stay."
882274,7690832,2013-09-30,6903662,Amber,"The apartment was everything that we were looking for! The complex was in an ideal location- close enough to downtown to walk, close to great restaurants and bars, etc. Nicole was really easy to get a hold of and extremely friendly. The check-in/out process was quick and easy as well.

The only negative was that the light in the bedroom was tricky. Something had to be plugged into the outlet and wiggled just right in order to get the light to turn on. Other than that, everything was great. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."
882274,7939031,2013-10-08,6734641,Justin,Nick was out of town so his friend Nicole assisted us. My wife and I moved to Seattle on a whim and needed a place to stay last minute the first night we arrived. Nicole was very quick to respond and set us up with this apartment. It's a great full-size apartment right in the heart of Capital Hill. Perfect location for walking/biking to everything in the city! We only stayed for one night but we had a nice sleep and were able to make coffee and breakfast before leaving. The wifi is super fast and parking wasn't a problem for us at all. I'd recommend this stay for others.
882274,7966772,2013-10-10,8844437,Inci Mi,"The location of the apartment and the communication with Nick/Nicole were perfect.

However, we were disappointed by the overall condition of the apartment as everything was dusty and full of hair from previous guests. You cannot expect every guest to remove the dust and to clean the whole apartment. 

"
882274,8022446,2013-10-13,764767,Marc,"Tiny little apartment in an awesome location. Whether you want to go downtown or hang out in the hip Capital Hill 'hood, this place is within walking distance from both. Check in and check out was super easy â didn't even have to see a person due to the lockbox. The property manager was super communicative and gave thorough instructions.

The apartment itself was furnished decently, but overall was slightly rough around the edges. The bathroom was tiny and the old plumbing and fixtures didn't make for the most pleasant of showers. My main complaint was that it was all a bit dusty, especially in the bathroom. But bonuses were: The kitchen had a brand new and clean fridge, and the mattress seemed very new and was comfy enough with a foam topper.

Ultimately, if you value location and convenience over comfort, this is a great place to stay at and very reasonable price. "
882274,8057298,2013-10-14,4441034,Heidi,Apartment was perfect for what we needed. Price was right.
882274,8182201,2013-10-19,2070558,Christopher,"Perfect location. Walking distance to many great local coffee shops, and restaurants. There's a market up the hill with incredible sandwiches, made with locally sourced foods. Great place to stay."
882274,8188850,2013-10-20,8328254,Christopher,Space was clean and comfortable. Great location!
882274,8217968,2013-10-21,3577946,Jason,Excellent experience. Easy check-in and a great spot for a quick trip to Seattle. Plenty to do nearby in the neighborhood. Will be sure come back in future trips to the city. Thanks!
882274,8252099,2013-10-22,8328254,Christopher,Great experience. 
882274,8287875,2013-10-23,9473400,Laura,"Apartment exactly as advertised. Simple, convenient, and clean."

882274,8512896,2013-11-03,9684315,Jody,so clean! super comfy! great host! great price! awesome location! 
882274,8599510,2013-11-07,1546101,Colin,"Cozy apartment in an amazing location between downtown and Capitol Hill.  Bed and overall stay very comfortable.  Key pickup and check out couldn't have been easier.  Great deal, highly recommended!"
882274,8689844,2013-11-12,9106456,Veronica,"The space was clean and cozy; it was exactly as pictured.  It was right on the edge of downtown and Capitol Hill, and it was relatively easy to walk everywhere or find public transit.  Messaging with Nick and Nicole made the trip so much easier!  They were able to accommodate my late arrival into town, and were willing to let me keep my luggage in the building after my flight was delayed 4 hours.  Will definitely check this place out again if I am visiting Seattle!  :) "
882274,8760353,2013-11-16,2714187,Meaghan,"I never actually met the hosts as it was a single serve apartment and we arrived later then we had originally intended, but the key was waiting for us in a lockbox and the apartment was totally cozy for our evening sojourn. They provide all the basic amenities and the bed is rly comfortable. The apartment is very conveniently located. The price and location alone sell this airbnb for what you come home too. :) Thanks Nick for contributing to our awesome weekend in Seattle."
882274,9095485,2013-12-06,3181989,Jay,Very professional.  A credit to Airbnb.  I definitely recommend staying at Nick's place.  Location was great. Apartment was perfect. Parking was tricky but I always found one.  Great restaurants in the area too.  Thanks Nick
882274,9389849,2013-12-25,5350059,Kristine,"We had tickets to attend a theater performance in the area, and this was a very convenient place to stay.  Basic but comfortable, and close to both downtown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods."
882274,9961985,2014-01-21,8054139,Rachael,"Nick's place was ideal for walking around downtown Seattle. There's a ton of restaurants in the area, and its easy walking to the waterfront and Pike Place. Be aware that if you have 3 people staying, the pullout couch/bed is not the most comfortable - it has a bar that kinda digs into your back. Also, the parking is quite difficult to find during some parts of the day (like mentioned in the details of the description) especially if there is a large event going on downtown."
882274,9999070,2014-01-24,3872193,Lauren,"Like others, I had no one helping me check in or out (which is fine; until recently, I lived a couple miles away).  Ridiculously awesome location, and it's even better for the price!  Will definitely be back when I'm in town."
882274,10020445,2014-01-26,2326741,Doan,"No fluff and frills accommodation but in an ideal location. We did not rent a car and were able to walk to downtown in 10 mins and within touring the city, we either walked or took the bus.  Nicole greeted us at the door and allowed us to drop off our luggage in the storage unit. She provided us with instructions for us to check in later the evening. The place was somewhat tight for 3 people but doable. If you're looking for a safe and ideal place to stay, I would suggest staying here for the price!"
882274,10418638,2014-02-18,3346613,Judah,"The location is absolutely perfect. The bed was extremely comfortable and seems fairly new. Check-in and out was really easy. The only complaint was the couch- it looks filthy and kind of smells mildewy on one side- not a huge issue as it's ignorable but I wouldn't want to sleep on it as a pull out bed.

I'd definitely stay here again next trip (though possibly in a different unit)."
882274,10566829,2014-02-25,6864490,Daniel,"This location is great. You are going to be very close to downtown and to a lot of great pubs and hipster bars. On our final night we had drinks at the ""Knee High Stocking Company"", which is right across the street. One important note, free parking on Friday and Saturday night seemed impossible to find. If you are driving you can save a lot of time by just paying for parking a few blocks away from the apartment.

I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle."
882274,10772905,2014-03-06,2734499,Jason,Great location. Great price. Comfortable bed. Thank you! I will use your listing again. 
882274,10887556,2014-03-11,563588,Nabil,"My family and I enjoyed our stay. The place was clean, convenient and quiet. The only negative I have is that parking is kind of tough, so you might have to circle around everytime you want to park. Other than that I would recommend this place to all who would like to be near the all the action on Capitol Hill and close to downtown."
882274,11094573,2014-03-20,2533611,Stuart,"Melrose Court 304 worked perfectly for us.  Check-in was straight-forward and convenient. Location was really great, right on the edge of Capitol Hill.  The apartment wasn't fancy but that's not what I look for.  It was  clean, comfortable,  and very quiet.  I would highly recommend.  Nick's friend Nicole was very helpful in the planning, booking, and arrival."
882274,11258071,2014-03-27,9543380,Lindsey,"The apartment was perfect for a place to sleep and get ready. I honestly spent very limited time in it, but it was quiet and had a great location with a short walk to basically everything. Nicole was very friendly and available to answer questions whenever I had them. I would definitely stay here again."
882274,11294419,2014-03-28,7505765,Aurora,"Fantastic location!!!!  
Building is a bit old but unit was clean, very confortable bed and it has all the basics you need for short stay in Seattle.  
I book the place within hours of arriving and Nicole's response was quick, helpful and efficient. Thank you so much!!!! Will be back for sure."
882274,11393249,2014-04-01,11050266,Peter,"Nice place at a decent price. The hosts were very good at communicating and was available throughout the day. It was very easy to get in and get out of the place, given that I didn't have to schedule a meeting time with the host for check-in and check-out. Overall a good experience. The only thing that you should be prepared for is that the sofa bed isn't very comfortable. It works, I still fell asleep on it and what not. The normal bed was much better. The heaters worked, neighborhood was on the most part quiet.  "
882274,11475424,2014-04-04,12544815,Leif,"This apartment is all about location. There are a ton of great coffee shops and bars literally around the corner, and downtown and the waterfront is also a short walk away. The unit smelled a bit like cigarette smoke and felt humid, but overall met our needs comfortably. "
882274,11551569,2014-04-07,858068,Amelia,"The apartment is in a great neighbourhood and I'd say a 15 minute walk to pike place, it was small but good enough for us, the only downside was that the only bathroom in the suite was in the bedroom so the person who stayed on the pull out couch had to come through the bedroom to use it."
882274,11677638,2014-04-11,5066085,Barry,"You get what you pay for.  After a long day of travel, my friend and I were ready to clean up and sleep!  Unfortunately, the restroom's light did not work when we arrived and we found the pullout couch to be pretty filthy.  The springs under the pullout couch did not support the mattress, so we had to take the sofa cushion to provide additional support.  Minimal accommodations, but there is a fully equipped kitchen, city maps, guidebooks, plus Shampoo and Body wash in the shower.  

We did not get to meet the host, but Nicole who was helping manage the apartment was very kind and helpful.  She answered every question we had promptly and attempted to address any issues we had as quickly as she could.  Thank you Nicole!
"
882274,11984676,2014-04-21,9294290,Jason,"Communication was great in regards to getting there. With all of the information provided it was very easy to get in and situated. with that said the quality of the apartment and the help to resolve issues was not of high quality. 

On the first night there we found out that the stove did not work; we were able to contact Nicole who helped us finish cooking our meal and said that she would let the landlord know about it immediately so it could be fixed ""tomorrow"". The stove was broken for two and a half days by the time we were leaving the apartment to go home; while leaving we ran into the landlord who said that he had just been notified about the stove by Nicole. During the two and a half days we were not able to contact Nicole so we ended up having to go to a local Target to buy a burner so that we could cook our food since we did not know what was going on with the apartment."
882274,12209325,2014-04-26,13034897,Isabel,"Let me start by saying this is my first time on Airbnb I don't have any previous experiences to compare my Seattle trip to. 

Communication:
Good but in need of improvements. I wished the instructions were sent before having to ask for them myself the day of needing them. However, Nicole always kept an open connection and was very nice and accommodating. Everything was as stated and expectations were met. Instructions clear.

Location: 
Very good. Within walking distance (10-30min) to spots of interest and also easy to get to from the Sea-Tac. Near Space needle, Chinatown, downtown,  pikes place, and amidst a popular part of town: Capitol Hill. Safe neighborhood. 

Apt:
For the price, very nice. Has all the necessities. Nothing fancy, but it's cozy and more than I need to be comfortable. Cool Muhammed Ali posters. Gets cold, but heaters were slightly helpful. The bed was very comfy for two, soft and warm. Felt CLEAN overall.

As a side note, the stove was not working until the very last days of my vacay. Unfortunately, it was very inconvenient bc my boyfriend and I have some food sensitivities and thus prefer to cook at home. When we mentioned it, Nicole was polite about it and eventually did fix the issue, but like I said, inconvenient. I realize things like this happen so I got over it and the apt is still worth the price even without the stove. (new occupants should not have a prob since it's a new stove) 

Overall:
I thought the apt was a GREAT DEAL and a good haven for my Seattle trip. "
882274,12336731,2014-04-29,12838260,Hannah,"We stayed for 3 nights and were really pleased with the location of the apartment - it was great being able to walk everywhere and not having to use public transport! The apartment is basic but is fine for a place to sleep for the night. Nicole was really helpful and was quick responding to our queries. We would recommend! 
"
882274,12446440,2014-05-02,5694574,Elizabeth & Jacob,"His place was just what we were looking for: simple and affordable, in a great location! "
882274,12656815,2014-05-07,5656179,Dave,"Nicks apt was perfectly located to explore Cap Hill and Downtown. Seattle is very walkable from this point, convenient to transit, restaurants, drinks and etc. The building sort of looks like a motel, was clean, safe and secure. Washing machines on site worked great, and Nicole arranged for us to leave 2 bags for 2 days after checkout. This was a great economy find!"
882274,12721033,2014-05-09,13956824,Angana,"I thought this place was great overall!  Nicole deals with Nick's listing and she was very responsive via text and calling.  I'd say that overall, for the price and location, this was a wonderful deal!  It is a compact place in the heart of the city and allowed us to walk everywhere.  It was neat and clean and perfect for us because we just wanted to hang our hats somewhere and sleep after a day of exploring.  However, there were a couple of issues.  
Upon arriving, there was no key available to us upon check-out, as arranged.  A quick call to Nicole resolved that, but it would take about 2 hours.  A storage locker was available and very helpful.  However, if we had needed to settle in as arranged and didn't have the luxury of being able to explore, this may have been an issue.  Next, there was always a damp smell in the apt and we were advised to keep the windows open as much as possible.  We did, which really did help, but since we weren't home most of the day, we didn't want to keep the windows open, even at the smallest opening setting.  There was a bit of mold on the ceiling of the bedroom.  Finally, our internet/tv was sporadic, though stayed on during our last day.  
I would say that the above issues were easily resolved and really weren't an issue.  The people who deal with the apt are responsive.  You'll be happy with the place if you're just looking for somewhere to sleep which isn't unreasonably priced and in the middle of the city.  It was overall (despite the mold) very clean, neat, and simple.  I would definitely recommend this place."
882274,12880066,2014-05-13,3967984,Nicole & Gilles,"Great location! Nicole was pretty good with correspondence and we had no troubles finding or accessing the apartment on arrival. It's pretty basic but pretty clean. We did notice a bit of mold in the corner of the bedroom ceiling but hopefully that will be addressed soon. The TV worked well with the digital box and the bed was super comfy. 


"
882274,13077749,2014-05-19,11349629,Perry,"Overall, this apartment is a great deal for its price. The check-in/key pick-up was very easy and the check-in time was flexible. Parking on the other hand was a bit of a pain point; we got lucky one night and parked on the streets but opted for a paid lot on the other night. As other guests have mentioned, the location of the apartment is perfect. It is a reasonable walk to both downtown and the popular capitol hill areas (or a very short uber/lyft ride away). Lastly, the apartment itself was a bit smaller than expected, but we didn't mind as we were mostly out. I would definitely recommend this apartment! "
882274,13194780,2014-05-21,1890584,Christal,"Nicole who manages the listing was very responsive and provided clear instructions on the check in process. There were no problems finding the place or getting access. The location is great! There are not many hotels in the area and I found it conveniently located. The sofa in the living room was not very comfortable to sit on for any length of time. The listing, as well as the book of guest information in the apartment, stated laundry soap could be found in the apartment and there was none. Since my stay was so short, I did not contact Nicole to ask about it but was counting on doing a load of laundry since I'd already been on the road a week before checking in here.  There was quite a bit of street noise throughout the night, but it is Seattle. If you are a light sleeper, you probably already travel with earplugs. Also, there is no microwave here."
882274,14193527,2014-06-14,14858711,Carisa,"The location of the apartment is very convenientï¼also it is pretty safe, I lived with my parents, so I slept on sofa bed in the living room. Actually the windows can't block noise and the blind windows can't stop the light from the corridor. So I suggest two people to live in this apartment will be better. "
882274,14341366,2014-06-17,9090219,Thomas,"Great stay at Nicks place (304 Melrose Courts).  Its not high end.  Small and sparse.  But it was clean. Bed was very comfortable. And the location and price were both great. You can walk straight down Pine street to the wharf and all its sites.  And Capital Hill is very cool.  Lots of great shops and bars, etc.   Good communication throughout.
All in all a very positive experience.  "
882274,14489197,2014-06-20,11589008,Tin,"My Gf & I had a great time! From the instructions on how to get to the apt to where to eat and places to see, they were the best of hosts! We will definitely rent this property again. 

The place is located on the border of Capitol Hill and downtown. We caught a movie. Saw Bruce Lee's grave site, the space needle, glass garden. Pike's market. All the while we took public transit. Very efficient. Cheers to Nick & Nicole!
"
882274,14685269,2014-06-24,7759427,Rod,"Nick's place was a perfect fit for our stay. Great location, 15 min walk from the space needle, 10 min from downtown and light rail station. We where in town to run the rock-n-roll marathon. We had a great time and a worry free stay. "
882274,14767051,2014-06-25,11517247,Clara,The entire experience was simple and easy. Let ourselves in with a lock box and checked out the same way. The place is clean and orderly. Everything is spelled out clearly. And it is in a great part of town!!! Many bars and restaurants within walking distance. 
882274,15040229,2014-07-01,5307464,Eva,Great neighborhood and location! Nicole provided lots of information about how to get to/from the apartment and everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. Thanks!
882274,15149520,2014-07-03,16272050,Mike,"Nicole (who helps Nick manage the apartment) was very friendly and prompt to respond! We used the locked storage to hold our bags before checkin, and Nicole made it a very smooth process. Overall, the apartment was quaint, clean, and had good furnishings. Thanks!"
882274,15307595,2014-07-07,12887481,Sabrina,"The place was perfect for my sister and I. It was small, but it turned out to be just like how it was described on the listing. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and liked how central it was to everywhere we wanted to go. 

Pros: Cost, location, super comfy bed

Cons: We had the windows in the bedroom open at night to let some air in and at times it was quiet loud, but it was still bearable. Also, there was an iron, but we couldn't find an ironing board, but again, not a huge issue. "
882274,15457053,2014-07-09,16181526,Larry,"Nicole, who handles Nick's place, was great. She was very accommodating in letting us store luggage before and after our stay. Although we didn't get the chance to meet her, she was easy to contact and answered all our questions. The location can not be beat! Melrose Market is steps away. Short walk to Pike Place. Great value."
882274,15920133,2014-07-18,13525095,Derek,The apartment was in a good location and clean. The check in process was simple and the apartment was as advertised and looked just like the pictures. Overall it was a great stay. 
882274,16198801,2014-07-23,13850055,Ryan,"Place is very well kept, everything was very clean.  Both the bedroom bed and couch bed are very comfortable."
882274,16640401,2014-07-30,1535197,Megan,"Simple set-up in a great location near all Capitol Hill food + drink spots. Complex seemed a bit ""well-worn"" but is probably hard to beat for the price. Nick's instructions for accessing the apt via an on-site lockbox were great, and the cleaning lady was arriving just as we were leaving and was very friendly. "
882274,17152079,2014-08-08,14815778,Jeramey,"Nick's apartment is a good crash pad for a couple out exploring the city. It's just up the hill from downtown, and near all of the Capitol Hill amenities. We enjoyed the easy transit and walking access (walking if you're okay with a hill).

Simple apartment located in a building that is very much of the era it was built."
882274,17373374,2014-08-11,7461206,Kendra,The apartment was nice and as advertised.  It is in a great location (though parking is tricky as he mentions).  I did not meet him but need to contact him regarding the cleaning person being in the unit when we checked-in and he responded quickly (and pleasantly).  The only issue was that the Wi-Fi was really slow and we were not able to watch something on our computer after a long day out and about.  I would recommend this place to others.
882274,17504307,2014-08-13,11557877,(email hidden),"The instructions from Nicole (apartment manager) were clear and easy to follow.  The neighborhood was fine with plenty of food/drink options nearby. There was a bit of noise from the nearby cross streets but we didn't plan on sleeping in or spending much time in the apt, so it didn't pose a problem. The walk from the nearest light rail station, Westpark stop, was approximately 15 minutes.   Overall, we had a pleasant stay in a a convenient location.
"
882274,17756124,2014-08-17,16403357,Lydia,"Nicole, who is the point of contact for Nick's guests, was great. She was extremely responsive and helpful. When we arrived, there was a binder with the house policies and suggestions of Nick's favorite places to go in Seattle.

It was great to have the place to ourselves, and the location was ideal. It was a fifteen-minute walk to downtown, and we walked to Pike Place Market our first morning there. There's so much else to do within walking distanceâfood, cocktails, and the barcade around the corner were all great. (You can walk to the Elliott Bay Book Company!)

There's a market a block away (City Market, at Bellevue and Olive Way) where you can pick up essentially anything extra you could need here, like extra toilet paper or coffee.

The apartment was a little stuffy, so we kept the windows open and used the fan in the bedroom. This is obviously a matter of personal preference, though. It wasn't overwhelmingly hot.

All in all, the place was great and the hosts were too. Highly recommended!"
882274,19013817,2014-09-04,8089255,Kim,"The apartment was lovely! Great neighborhood, very clean accommodations, overall a great night spent in Seattle! We were able to walk everywhere- dinner, a cozy bar for dessert and a drink, and even a breakfast place when we woke up! The apartment was perfect for a couple. Thank you Nick! "
882274,19728514,2014-09-17,916570,Joyce,"In a neighborhood of nice apartment buildings, this building was quite run-down.  Inside the apartment, new flooring throughout offset the overall shabbiness.  Neither living room or bedroom windows had curtains, the venetian blinds were broken, so we were pretty much on view to neighboring residents once it got dark.  The sofa springs were shot, so when we sat on it our bottoms were nearly on the floor; the black and white chair featured in the online ad was quite comfortable.  The kitchen contained the standard coffee maker, but no coffee.  We've stayed in airbnb apartments in other US cities and in Paris and never before had to go out and buy our own coffee.  The info email said there was laundry soap under the sink; there wasn't any.  The fridge had a nice freezer but no ice cube trays.  Worst of all, there was no backstock of toilet paper.  Two of us checked in for 6 nights and we were provided with one partial roll of toilet paper.  
All this after we had trouble with our check-in.  We were not met.  We had an earlier email saying we  would receive access instructions 48 - 72 hours before arrival.  In fact the email was sent on the morning of our arrival, so we had no way to access it while we were on the road.  When we arrived and couldn't gain access, I called the contact phone number and got voice mail and had to wait a while to receive instructions to get in."
882274,19824400,2014-09-19,18655414,Ashley,"I stayed with two other travel companions and it was exactly as described. Location was extremely close to popular landmarks - it took us about 15 minutes to walk to Pike's. Nick/Nicole have thoughtfully put together a binder of nearby places to grab food, as well as maps/brochures, and a gallon of drinking water!

As others have stated, you get what you pay for in terms of size. The bathroom is located off of the bedroom, so hopefully you're traveling with friends you feel comfortable enough with to walk through their temporary room in the middle of the night when nature calls. The pull-out couch was fine to sleep on for a couple nights. No A/C, but plenty of other tenants left their doors open while they were inside. We did the same, and it cooled down the unit fairly quickly.

This was our first excursion to Seattle, and we mostly used the apartment to sleep and store our belongings, which it was perfect for. Nicole is extremely well-organized and provides detailed instructions for anything you require assistance with. There is a storage unit onsite that we used to store our belongings after check-out and before our flight home. Overall, the description and reviews painted an accurate picture of what to expect. Remember that you get what you pay for in terms of luxury - we opted for bare minimum in order to spend more on food! :)"
882274,20137286,2014-09-24,17026459,Gaurav,"This is nice and convenient location if you are attending conference in convention center or wish to visit downtown. Both are within walking distance and yet the apartment is in quiet location. It will take about 10 min to walk. However walk is up the hill.

Apartment is good. There are no complains. Its upkeep could be improved a little but that does not mean one should not consider it. This is not a adverse comment, it is just a suggestion. 

Nick was quick to respond to all my sms request.  Though by nature I prefer personal meetings and voice calls. This is again personal preference.

From the airport I took a Light rail to down town. Nick had given excellent guidelines. 

If you decide to cook etc. then request for more vessels/cutlery etc.

If I have to stay again and purpose is to visit town whole day I would choose it. It is value for money."
882274,20468997,2014-09-29,11054550,Ashley,"I stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend.  I had excellent communication with Nicole (Nick's friend who manages the property) prior to my arrival.  The apartment was great and exactly as described.  The location can't be beat - 15 min walk to Pike Market, 2 min to Pine/Pike St.  Lots of cafes, restaurants, and pubs in the area.  Overall a great experience, definitely would stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
882274,20960817,2014-10-08,11363544,Maria,Apartment is pretty no frills - but it works and you can't beat the price/location. The place is in a fun neighborhood close to some great shops/restaurants. Also walkable to all of downtown/Pikes Place/Space Needle. I would definitely recommend it and would certainly stay again. 
882274,21284825,2014-10-14,20134685,Jemini,"Good value for what we paid. Apartment is in a great location and within walking distance of majors attractions, etc. Apartment is ideal for 1-2 people. The host, Nicole, was easily accessible and arranged for the storage of our luggage. "
882274,21380028,2014-10-16,11100388,Pierre-Alain,"The apartment is well situated, close to Seattle downtown. A good place to visit the city! A good choice of restaurants and fancy places around the flat.
Nicole's is very reactive and very helpful!

There is a laundry in the building - quite convenient - don't forget to have some detergent with you if you plan to use it!

However, the place is quite noisy (I recommend that you bring along earplugs). It is also noteworthy that there is no door between the living room and the bedroom. It is essentially a student place so do not expect more than that. But I think this is in line with the low price tag for the area."
882274,21468512,2014-10-18,21022997,Yuiko,"Five star location! Great neighborhood. We felt safe walking to downtown and around the area with our child. 

Nick (and Nicole) communicated great. The descriptions of the place is acurate. The place was easy to find and the step-by-step instruction to check in was helpful. 

As some of other reviews states, upkeep can be improved. I would have given 5 stars only if they had a set of newer fresher linens. 

But again, the location cannot be beat. The place was adequate and a great deal for what we used it for - just a place to sleep after all day sightseeing. Thank you very much! "
882274,21595136,2014-10-20,17150536,Katie,"Really great location.  The major tourist attractions can all be walked to in under 20 minutes and the Capital Hill neighborhood has plenty to offer.  Parking was the only downside (no dedicated spot), but we were able to find street parking close by both nights."
882274,21742196,2014-10-23,19422240,Joana,"Nick's apartment was the perfect base for me and my partner while in Seattle. It's literally a few minutes from downtown Seattle (we're fast walkers!) and Westlake station. The apartment was a great size, was very clean and had all the amenities you'd want from an airbnb place, including recs for good eateries in a handy little folder. Nicole, who handles Nick's apartment, was wonderfully accommodating and very responsive. We particularly appreciated the secure luggage storage facility that was made available to us on our last day, on which our departing flight was very late at night. I'd definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!"
882274,21849122,2014-10-25,22460622,Sarah,"It was a great location, very walkable which was great since we didn't have a car. Nick was quick to respond during the reservation process and our stay there. "
882274,22020037,2014-10-28,7158315,Tyler,Had a great time! Thanks Nick. Will definitely come back.
882274,22394942,2014-11-05,19477326,Julien,Overall this place worked really well for me and my wife.  The location was unbeatable as we were less than a mile from most places we wanted to go.  We did have a car and parking for the most part was not a problem around the area.  Nicole gave great instructions on how to get into the apartment and checking in and out was very easy.  There were some negatives including the mold growing on the edges of the ceiling at the front and back of the apartment and the also the cleanliness could be slightly better.  Again these issues were not a deal breaker for us but we would have preferred to have been given a heads up prior to making a decision on where to stay.  The nice thing is I believe these issues are easily correctable and the next people renting should hopefully have an upgraded experience.   Overall the place was very good and with a few changes here and there it could really be great.
882274,22740868,2014-11-13,22815658,Devin,Had a wonderful time in Seattle. Apartment is located within 15mins walking distance of the space needle and pike market. 
882274,22945558,2014-11-18,3597694,Katy,"Great location Capitol Hill that is walking distance from the light rail if you're coming from SeaTac.  Clean, dormitory-like apartment.  The bed was comfortable and we definitely used the extra duvet due to the unexpected cold weather.  We didn't hear a peep from neighbors either. Right near the Melrose Market, which was great. A good stay! "
882274,23241122,2014-11-26,22373480,Michael,Host was very thorough with arrival instructions and communicative about the location ahead of the process. Very easy to find and gain access to the property. The apartment was very clean and the location can't be beat. Highly recommend this property.
882274,23491029,2014-12-02,20393134,Hsiao Ya,The hosts were so nice:) they answered every questions what I had. The place was clean and the area was really convenience. My friends who from Seattle they said this area is their dream place to stay at.  if I go back to Seattle I will definitely go back to stay this place for sure.
882274,23609965,2014-12-06,13429051,Filemon,"Great location. Apartment was fine for the price. Hassle free, easy and a great deal for Capitol Hill. "
882274,24732319,2015-01-02,12740888,Sarah,"The unit and the building were quite run down but it was a great location and an easy walk to downtown and capitol hill. The place could have been cleaner- there was a thick layer of dust bunnies on the floor of the closet in the bedroom, the shower had a constant leak the host said was going to get fixed during our stay but I don't think this got done, and the sheets for the pull out couch did not fit. The pull out mattress was quite coil-y and very uneven (it dipped up and down in places), so would definitely not recommend 3 people stay here. The Roku box was also nice. But overall, for the price I would have rather paid a bit more and just stayed at a hotel."
882274,25083837,2015-01-06,20505732,Shouheng,Location is good. We are only 10 minutes' drive area from Pike Place Market and the Seattle Art Museum. The apartment itself is not very clean though. The couch in particular is pretty dirty and we cover the cushion with linens before sitting on it.
882274,25162492,2015-01-08,20659809,Corrine,The location of the apartment was as convenient as described. My friends and I were able to go everywhere we wanted without a problem. We only slept there so it worked for our needs
882274,25623257,2015-01-20,26224339,Jacklyn,"Great space for a weekend trip. We were with in walking distance to so many great restaurants and it was only a ten minute walk to downtown. The bed was super comfy, and after a long day on the city, we wound down with a cup of tea and some Netflix. Nick's place made our stay in Seattle very enjoyable.  We've already recommended to friends! "
882274,25716415,2015-01-24,21577924,ä¸¹ä¸¹,"The apartment was a little old, but the location is great. The heating system is old too. There are one bad and one sofa bed. But because the sofa bed is broken, 3 of us had to squeeze in one bed. Also, the beaker tripped for several times. But the Host is really nice. She answered any question I had even if it's late night. She also gave us very detailed direction to get the apartment. "
882274,26162375,2015-02-05,26420795,Maria Fernanda,"Really kind and concerned host, he was always keeping an eye on the process. Everything was perfectly fine."
882274,26321924,2015-02-09,19171938,Tabitha,"The apartment was super cozy, and getting access to the room went without the a hitch. There was consistent communication from the time that I booked the place, and up until I got there which was extremely reassuring. The place is in such a great spot of Seattle, access to so many places (bars, food, and downtown). It was quiet in the evening, which was also really nice. I would definitely stay with Nick again should I ever find myself in Seattle. "
882274,26595918,2015-02-16,17480810,Rishi,"Nick did a great job of insuring I knew how to find the apt and how to get in. The listing is accurate in terms of looks and what it provides. It's a pretty bare minimum unit, but great for those who are not looking for much during their stay. If you're focused on being out and about then this place will do the trick. 

The location is PRIME in terms of getting around all over mayor parts of Seattle primarily by foot. Could not have picked a better location for that. If you visit here, be sure to walk around the neighborhood you're in, as there are some amazing small restaurants, bars, coffee houses.

The place is a lot older than you may think as it's in a pretty classic Seattle neighborhood. The place overall could use a few touch ups in the bathroom/shower to really make it ""cozy"". 

Thanks Nick for a great stay!"
882274,26761233,2015-02-18,6934613,Mollie,"Clear and thorough directions. Easy stay. Everything was as pictured. Good location, close to downtown and walkable to Pike Place. Would stay here again!"
882274,26889974,2015-02-21,11280710,Mark,"Nicole's space (I never dealt with Nick during my stay) was great way to begin my first visit to Seattle. Location was right off the freeway entrance making it was to reach her space. My first impression of the area was the parking. Parking was very tricky around the location. Everything is metered and very compact. Make sure you come as a pro at parallel parking. Upon entering, I then noticed all the posters on the wall which was very motivational. It's always a good reminder that we can always become better than we were yesterday. Amenities were very limited; A TV with access to Netflix for entertainment, an empty fridge, comfortable bed, and a shower with less than spectacular shampoo & conditioner and body wash. Her instructions can feel very micromanaging but rules are rules. 
But nevertheless, I was here specifically for the location. Capitol Hill is the center of the lively part of the city and I wanted to be apart of it. 24 hour fitness was a few blocks away, as well as all of the food and bars in the area. Capitol Hill has some of the best foodie joints and coffee IMO. But that's for all of you to find for yourselves ;) 
All-in-all I had a positive experience. Would I come back? Well, that's for me to decide another day. "
882274,27046106,2015-02-24,24448886,Rishi,"Nick's apartment was a great place for a short stay in Seattle. It is perfectly located in Capitol Hill and makes a great base from which to explore the city. 

The only real draw back is that if you need two beds, the pull-out couch can be a bit uncomfortable. The bed in the bedroom was perfectly comfortable, though. "
882274,27434428,2015-03-04,19651706,Kraven,"I like the cozy apartment, bed is soooo comfortable maybe a bad thing combined with the rain... You won't get out of bed! Locations is perfect - between Capitol Hill and downtown is like been in both places. Never took bus which I love. "
882274,27636698,2015-03-09,20810835,Sarah,"The location is AMAZING and totally worth it just for that, but I wouldn't stay here if you think you're going to spend much time there. The apartment isn't very well kept up (generally clean, but moldy and old electric/windows/furnishings/plumbing), and the living room is super drafty and you can really hear traffic noise. All the basics are there (coffee maker, etc) but Nicole was pretty checked out. We needed a second set of keys and didn't get them until our 3rd day, and then it was only 1 of the keys we needed. I'd recommend it for a couple that's looking to explore. Probably wouldn't stay here again though."
882274,28249519,2015-03-21,24703243,Rachael,"The place was perfect for what we were looking for in a room. One of its best qualities is the location, it's unbeatable. Just a few-minute walk to the center of downtown, and in a great neighborhood. We rarely heard any noises from the neighbors, which is always a plus. The apartment itself is cozy and the bed is extremely comfortable, I slept like a rock every single night. If you're looking for a place that is totally up-to-date (you can tell the building is old), this probably isn't for you, but it wasn't bothersome to me. All in all, I would definitely stay at this location again on my next visit to Seattle! "
882274,28469003,2015-03-24,17619331,Vickie,"Perfect location, we parked the car and walked straight down Pine to the heart of downtown Seattle. "
882274,28601373,2015-03-27,890017,Misty,"Nick's apartment is in a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Market and other tourist attractions. The apartment was clean. The sofa bed needs to be repaired or replaced. A few of the springs are missing. Nick doesn't charge for a third guest, so this might be a case of getting what you pay for. The shower works, but the water comes out in a single flow like a garden hose. These were small inconveniences for a nice place to stay in a great location. "
882274,28667374,2015-03-28,1585442,Aaron,"The place was affordable and in a good location. 

Advertised as two beds but one was a pull out sofa. Realllly worn in. And the sheets did not fit. That was a bigger issue because the mattress pad had rust. 

So, affordable and great location but not good for two"
882274,28861364,2015-03-31,23506856,Natalie,"Overall, our stay was pleasant. I really appreciated the fast communication from Nicole and the friendly staff we came across. There were a few hiccups along the way but they were corrected. Would have loved to have someone on site to speak to personally, but I loved the location and the price was great. "
882274,29387279,2015-04-07,421821,Justin,The description of the place was very accurate It was clean and close to any amenities that I needed. I will be staying there again
882274,30084343,2015-04-17,23324189,Gaia, Nick's apartment is a simple and clean space. It is exactly as described. It is walking distance (10-15mins) to the centre of town. One bed and one pull out sofa was enough for three people. We had a good stay. The check in procedure was easy and stress-free. 
882274,30169998,2015-04-18,11054550,Ashley,"This was my second time staying at Nick's place and it was just as good as the first.  Simple, clean space walking distance to everything I needed."
882274,30491693,2015-04-23,11358659,Mj,All went smoothly.
882274,31241660,2015-05-03,263443,Richard,"The apartment was as described in the listing and the pictures are an accurate representations.  Nick's friend Nicole was helpful in getting me checked in.  Once I was checked in I had no more contact.  

The place was basically clean, but could use a thorough dusting of the pictures and especially the cabinets.  It was well stocked with the basics.

The neighborhood is very cool, but maybe not very suited for those looking for peace and quiet.  There is a lot do just around the corner and a wide variety of bars and restaurants within a few blocks.

I never could figure out the tv, but that is ok since I had my tablet and the wifi worked well.

I would recommend this place especially for college students and young people wanting to experience the Seattle night life."
882274,31933718,2015-05-12,26923768,Gilman,"Good communication with hosts Nick and Nicole, apartment as listed, great location."
882274,32288241,2015-05-16,21616976,Stephanie,Great apartment and location in Capitol Hill! Would highly recommend!
882274,32484318,2015-05-18,20735360,Hufsa,"The host made us feel welcomed in the apartment. The listing was quite accurate. Nick emailed us detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment and to check out. There was even a binder with special instructions to use the wifi and the tv. The neighborhood was close to the downtown area however, it was a bit noisy at night. We heard lots of car screeches at odd hours of the night. Overall we felt safe in the apartment and the ROKU box was nice to have around. The apartment was good for the price we paid. It is a bit small if you have a large party but we found it manageable for 3 people. "
882274,32861451,2015-05-22,8314868,Nisha,The place was decent but the pictures are a bit deceiving. It smells a bit musty and it's pretty bare bones and outdated. The wifi didn't work the entire time I was there. But for the price you really can't complain. The bed is comfy and the hosts are nice and allowed me to check out a bit late. It's in a great location near a ton of restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay there again if I was on a budget.
882274,33247508,2015-05-26,30011195,Robert,"Nick communicated very well, also keeping connected from the beginning of the process till the day I arrived.  The location was amazing!  Parking was tough 1-2 days, I had to park about a mile away from the apartment.  The apartment was cozy.  A couple of opportunities, the sofa bed was broken, so my friend who slept on it was disappointed about the experience.  The shower head was broken as well, so taking a shower was a little challenging.  Overall we were pretty happy with our experience.  "
882274,33402148,2015-05-27,4331204,Larisa,"The apartment is located in a great area, close to highway and hang out places. The apartment was simple but quite good for the price and had everything that we needed. "
882274,33455130,2015-05-28,17973966,Adriane,The place was easy to find. Had to pay for parking was the only downside. Very simple place beds are comfortable. 
882274,34004160,2015-06-03,32208707,Justin,"The host was great and very accommodating. The apartment was ok if you are just looking for a place to crash. Great location however don't plan on sleeping in because it is loud. Also, the cleanliness of the apt was questionable. "
882274,34685413,2015-06-10,24410063,Lily,I love his space! And His directions were very helpful. His cute little apartment is right in capital hill! There are cute shops and restaurants everywhere! We definitely had a lovely stay!
882274,35203377,2015-06-16,29333276,Danielle,"The neighborhood was fantastic! My friend and I were able to walk downtown with ease, as well as being ideally situated near great restaurants and bars. The apartment suited our needs since we had planned to be out and about most of the day. We were able to cook breakfast in the morning before starting out day, courtesy of the host's kitchen (equipped with pots/pans/plateware). As Texas girls, we are accustomed to always having AC (you kind of need it when temps go over 100 deg F during the summer), but Seattle's weather was termparate enough without it. When we had issues with the internet connection at the apartment, the host was quick to work with us to rectify it. "
882274,35409868,2015-06-18,33150765,Edgar,"This was the first time my friends and I used Airbnb and the experience as a whole went well. There were aspects that could have gone smoother, specifically the communication. While the host did reply to my messages I felt too many times I had to send a second message because my question wasn't answered or I was waiting for info they said they would send me the day before. Obviously I know they can be super busy with all they're reservations but it just added some stress to the trip. The only other thing is as people have said the pullout couch which was missing springs that almost left it unusable leading my friend to sleep on it unfolded instead. Other than these two things the space was great. The location was extremely convenient, the place was clean and more than enough space for the three of us. I would recommend this space to others."
882274,35475606,2015-06-19,33247538,Sheralee,"The location of this apartment could not be more convenient! It is up a few flights of steps and cozy, indeed, though, so it could be challenging for people traveling with a lot of luggage. The apartment itself is no-frills, but colorful and has with everything needed for a comfy stay. The hosts are very welcoming, do a great job of giving instructions, and respond super fast to any question you might have! We're glad we found it!"
882274,36167185,2015-06-26,16351764,Bridget,We had a very nice stay at the apartment.  It was clean and a great location for us.  Nicole was extreme helpful and accommodating.  Thank you!
882274,36911784,2015-07-02,4776999,Steve,"The studio was nice and in a great location (Capitol Hill). The street noise was a bit noisy (summer - so slept with the windows open), but besides that the unit was nice. The host gave great instructions and arrival and departure were both very easy."
882274,37071308,2015-07-04,11531688,Smita,"It was overall a good experience to stay at Nick's apt 304 Melrose Ave.
Pros-
1]Nick and Nicole were excellent in correspondence. So booking and other getting answers to any of your queries was quick and prompt.
2]  Since we were arriving late around midnight the lockbox for keys was very convenient.
3]Apt was small but clean 
4] The biggest plus is pretty close to downtown and highway 5!
5] Nice to have a kitchen for light cooking.

Cons-
1] If you have a car , street parking is little difficult to find :(. Outside apt it has 2 hrs parking restriction.
2] We stay in july at it was extremely hot and AC would have been comfortable.
Apt has just one ok fan.
3] As soon as you open the door there are railing not pretty safe for younger kids.
You have be little careful if you have kids.
4] No elevator so if you have luggage you need to climb the staircase to reach the 3rd floor!
5] Street noise is a pain if you are used to silence while sleeping.

Overall it is a good place to stay if you want to visiting Seattle!"
882274,38253641,2015-07-14,5799447,Pat,"I stayed for 10 days and have stayed here before, as the location is great and the service from the host is very prompt.  It is walking distance to downtown and many other Seattle neighborhoods and attractions; and buses are nearby and plentiful.  The host made checking in and out very easy, and when I had questions or needed some supplies, they were very prompt and friendly.  Good value for the money."
882274,38499723,2015-07-16,33854015,Benjamin,"Stayed at this lovely little apartment during a recent trip to Seattle. Nick and Nicole were great hosts. They check in process was easy and the stay was terrific. The unit does not have an A/C but this is normal in the area. If you are travelling in the summer months, you might need an extra fan as the one that is provided does a good job, but the apartment needs a fan in both rooms. Other than that, the location is great and the apartment is very clean and comfortable. Nick and Nicole are very easy to communicate with and answer emails/texts very quickly. Thanks for a great stay!"
882274,39506464,2015-07-24,3172347,Andrew,"Nicole provided detailed directions/ instructions which made key pick-up easy, and she was available to answer questions we had about the WIFi not working which was very helpful. The apartment is in an older building in a great location. It was summer when we were there so the apartment got very stuffy during the day but if you're staying here you'd be more interested in going out and about and can just open the windows up when you get back."
882274,40647153,2015-08-01,94054,Daniel,"The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. Instructions from the host were helpful and access into the building and apartment was seamless. With the windows open (hot summer nights), it's a bit noisy, with the I-5 freeway buzzing by. It's a motel-style building, with external entry-way facing a courtyard. "
882274,41060697,2015-08-04,5386889,Jay,Great proximity to downtown and all of Capital Hill with its great neighborhood restaurants and bars. Small apartment - perfect for a couple of guests for a weekend escape. 
882274,41360832,2015-08-07,6826864,Tiffany,"This apartment was just as described.  Perfect location close to lots of great restaurants, easy access to public transport and downtown/the pier was just a short downhill walk.  The place is simple, but that is what we were looking for and expected.  Perfect for a couple who want convenient place to crash.  The wifi was the only thing that gave us an issue, but there are so many coffee shops with free internet access that it was hardly a problem.  Thanks for a great stay!"
882274,42510373,2015-08-14,13886387,Monika Jingchen,Very good location with lots of restaurants and tourist attractions around. Accurate description and photos of the place. No elevator so bringing up heavy luggage can be painful.
882274,42869533,2015-08-16,23706485,Alexandre,"The apartmant is nice.
Perfect locacalization.
Could be a little bit cleanner"
882274,43357947,2015-08-19,32497462,Georgie,Nick gave us very clear instructions for finding and letting ourselves into the apartment. He was also very quick to sort out an issue that we pointed out to him. The apartment was clean and comfortable and in a great location for walking to all of the tourist attractions we wanted to see. I would recommend this place for a young couple.
882274,43797705,2015-08-22,19754324,Elizabeth,"First off, I would definitely book this apartment with my husband again (read next paragraph for the ""you should know..."").  It was very clean, we had everything that we needed, and the location was amazing.  When I travel, I love getting a real feel for a city.  Capitol Hill had a ton of great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops.  We went for a quick run up to the water tower in the nearby park where you can see the whole city.   You are on the edge of the whole downtown- minutes from Pike's market and the ferries.  AND when we rented a car to go to Mt. Ranier, the rental was 2 blocks away and you just hop on the highway and go. Really great experience overall!

Here's what I wish I had expected though:  The apt building is set-up like a motel facing in on an unkempt courtyard.  As east coasters, this was weird and made us pretty uncomfortable when we arrived.  It took a few hours for us to feel good about it, but when we did, we realized that we were perfectly safe. The courtyard is really well lit at night and a few neighbors even have their bikes permanently stored outside.  I probably wouldn't book it if I was traveling as a single female, but I probably wouldn't do airbnb if I was traveling as a single female so...

In conclusion, for a clean and affordable housing option, I highly recommend it. 

 

"
882274,44106978,2015-08-24,11312276,Andy,"Nick and Niki were very communicative.  This place is little and has very simple amenities but the lively neighborhood, its proximity to the Convention Center, great nearby stores and restaurants makes it a really great place to stay. "
882274,44658000,2015-08-28,38103295,Jean Paul,"Logement tout Ã  fait convenable compte tenu du prix, facile d'accÃ¨s et dans un quartier tout Ã  fait plaisant. Les principales attractions de Seattle ne sont pas trÃ¨s Ã©loignÃ©es mÃªme Ã  pied....
Excellent sÃ©jour, merci!"
882274,45657021,2015-09-05,33685909,Connie,"Nick was a great host!  All of my last minute questions were answered quickly.  He allowed us to check in early.  His place is nothing swanky, but it was clean and in a cool part of town.  easy to get to from the light rail. We definitely got a lot of exercise hiking up and down all the hills.  We'd stay there again.  "
882274,45812475,2015-09-06,6225827,Neil,Nick's place is fantastic and really easy to get in and out of. Highly recommended for great neighborhood and well prepared hosts.
882274,46714251,2015-09-13,35300602,Colleen,"BEST LOCATION! This apartment, may not look like a lot from the outside, but honestly it was a great stay for us. The  Pillow Team was extremely attentive - although I never met them - they were still  made us feel very welcome & left us very clear instructions on how to access the lock box for the apartment. It was just my husband and I who stayed, but the space definitely could accommodate another 1-2 people (as the couch pulled out). Everything was very clean and cozy - also they had a Roku & instructions on how to use it, which was a nice touch! Honestly, the best part about this apartment is the location - you truly are in the heart of Seattle in Capitol Hill with tons of bars & restaurants nearby - only a 15-20 minute walk to Pike's Place as well!"
882274,47362130,2015-09-18,19216541,Nancy,"The basic description of the apartment was as listed. The only discrepancy being that the owner listed it as his home. Just a small thing, but this is clearly an apartment furnished for AirBnB. Not a problem, just stating a fact. I missed that the Pillow management co. was actually renting the place for the owner and that was my only problem with the apartment. Otherwise, it is a good price in a convenient neighborhood. Caveat: do not bring a car."
882274,47996233,2015-09-22,2298443,Christine,"We enjoyed our stay at Nick's apartment. It was exactly as described, in a great location, and very clean. We appreciated that access was super easy, thanks to clear lockbox instructions. Communication was especially outstanding. Thanks for a great experience!"
882274,48866721,2015-09-29,35003910,Nick,"The room was clean, convenient, and close to everything. Plus, there is a late night walk-up window where you can get pie right around the corner. How great is that?"
882274,49448373,2015-10-04,27859949,Gloria,"Nick uses the service Pillow to assist guests with check-in and any inquiries. We had all the information needed before check-in. We arrived after midnight and had absolutely no problem with getting the key to the unit. The unit is as described; cozy and in the heart of Capitol Hill. It was our first time visiting Seattle and we only used PT during our stay. Bus routes run nearby and frequently to the Space Needle Center and the Pike Market. If you're on a budget and looking for a vibrant, young, neighborhood - this is where  you want to be. "
882274,49974822,2015-10-08,27708625,Pamela,"Nick and Pillow were very accommodating and responded to my emails quickly even when they were sent short notice. The directions given were easy to follow. The location of the apartment was PERFECT. Everything that I wanted to visit was within walking distance. The location was close enough to restaurants and coffee shops, but far away enough from the bumbling noise of the city. I will definitely recommend this spot to my friends and hope that there will be open availability for when I visit Seattle again. Thank you Nick and Pillow! "
882274,50181643,2015-10-10,42337780,Yoonjung,"it is really good location!
there are restaurants near the house.
and there is new starbucks. it is really good. 
i think don`t need to go the starbucks in pike place market. 
here is better than there.
"
882274,51011363,2015-10-17,14370991,Willem,"Nice apartment, with plenty of space for 2 people. Perfect location.

The booking was managed by a third-party website on behalf of Nick. They responded very quickly to my messages. Before you can receive the codes needed to access the apartment, you have to go to their site (not Airbnb) to confirm your arrival time and accept their terms and conditions. On my link the arrival date was wrong, so I was reluctant to confirm my arrival for a wrong date. However, this could not be changed and it was the only way to get the information on how to access the apartment.

The instructions eventually were clear and check-in was very easy. Apartment could have been cleaned better, though."
882274,51527951,2015-10-21,19969508,Artemis,Nick's place in Capitol Hill was amazing. It looks a bit sketchy at first but it is really very safe and with so many restaurants and bars all around. This place is great if you're going to walk everywhere like we did! Would definitely re-book this place. 
882274,53673878,2015-11-11,5413406,Carolyn,"the apartment was basically as advertised.  The pull-out couch was offered as an option for a 3rd guest, which we had.  However, the couch was flimsy and is collapsed in the middle.  the check in was very convenient and the neighborhood was great.  there were so many restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance.  "
882274,55110797,2015-11-28,45737907,Bob,"Nick's AirBnB was just what I need for me visit to Seattle.  The location was great, just 2 blocks from my daughter's place so it was very convenient.  There are plenty of great coffee places within a couple of blocks. There was a slight mix-up regarding the keys when I first arrived but it was corrected quickly. "
882274,55416229,2015-12-01,12836652,Lauren,"Overall cute place an great location, but I had a few issues. First it was a hit challenging to find and parking was tricky since you are not provided with a permit. Secondly the cleaning fees are way to high and make the place not as a great of a deal as it seemed initially. Also pillow--the third party you have to use--- is not helpful and intact more work for the guest. "
882274,55653726,2015-12-04,38253212,Kirby,"This listing was not at all as it appeared on Airbnb. First of all, we booked this apartment with Nick and about 4 months out from our stay, Nick let us know that that apartment was no longer available and that we would be moved to a different unit in the same apartment. The unit we ended up staying in was dirty and had a horrible musky smell. It was listed as a 1 bed/1 bath, which it was not. It would be considered a studio, as there is no door to the bedroom; unfortunate to find out when you were expecting a 1 bedroom apartment. The kitchen wasn't a complete or clean kitchen. There was no microwave or dishwasher (workable), however the water in the kitchen sink DID NOT WORK (only a small dribble). So if you expect to use any dishes in the kitchen, be prepared to wash your dishes in the bathroom sink...gross. Also, be prepared to have to walk through the ""bedroom"" to get to the bathroom.. The second bed in the apartment was an Ikea futon..a very small and VERY uncomfortable couch AND bed. The living area was extremely unlivable and unsleepable. At the end of our stay, we could not find the check-out time listed anywhere on the Airbnb website (Nick uses a host site called Pillow that is very un-userfriendly) so we were intruded on by Nick's cleaning staff and were nearly charged for a whole extra day of staying there. Luckily we were able to solve that situation, but it required us to head to the airport early and completely cut out our last day in Seattle; very disappointing as we had planned and saved up for this trip for quite some time. Overall I would not recommend staying in this apartment complex. The one redeeming quality of the apartment was its proximity to Pike Place Market and downtown Seattle."
882274,56059741,2015-12-08,49211705,Keith,The location was the best part of the experience - smothered between Capital Hill and Downtown was excellent and many bars and restaurants within walking distance.
882274,56516478,2015-12-14,15897862,Pollin,"This apartment was in the perfect location! It is a 12 minute walk to Pike Place Market, right next to a great Mediterranean place called mamnoon and the Starbucks reserve.  I would definitely stay here again!"
8605841,53518497,2015-11-09,43220101,Chris,"Collin is a wonderful host. He was there to check us in and show us around the place. He was readily available to contact and responded promptly to requests, and he gave us our space/was not intrusive. The space is very comfortable and roomy, and he has very nicely decorated it. The bed was comfortable. It's very conveniently located, and there's a park right near by. I would definitely stay here again."
8605841,56079939,2015-12-08,47266387,Kayla,"It was really pleasant. Everything was as expected, if not better. Colin was extremely welcoming and the space was perfect, exactly as described."
4404126,44863653,2015-08-29,28730361,Els,"It was our first experience with airbnb, and it couldnât have been better. Lily is a great host: she is very friendly and very welcoming. On our arrival she had a little bit of time to show us around the neighbourhood, giving us great suggestions where to eat, where to go for a drink or what to do. Lily's apartment is conveniently located right in Capital Hill. Itâs in a beautiful old building, the room is very nice and clean. She welcomed us with her favorit local wine and snacks, towels, even provide some other travel essentials. She also had lots of info available in our room. We had a great stay and would definitely stay there again if visiting Seattle.

I would recommend her as a Super Host. She even provided some gimmicks and snacks and wrote a personal letter with tips etc that made me feel really comfortable and welcome!  :) If I come back to Seattle, this will definitely be my place to go :) "

She prepare me a little snacks, bottle of wine, traveling kits and personal letter. I had a good time in Seattle. I definitely come back and stay with her.  "
4404126,46088961,2015-09-07,21340719,Kate,"Lily was very friendly, welcoming and helpful to us during our stay in Seattle. She lives in a perfect location to explore the Capital Hill district. The room was clean, affordable and in a beautiful building. Anyone who is interested in saving money by sharing a space is encouraged to give this place a chance. "
4404126,46241285,2015-09-08,23987396,Kelsey,"Lily was great in coordinating with me. I just needed a place to crash because I was going to be at Bumbershoot all day and she even left some chocolate for me. Very charming building, and place to hang your clothes if you need. I'd definitely recommend her place to stay!"
4404126,46437401,2015-09-10,19905565,Kelsang,"My first airbnb experience and what a lovely experience. Lily's apartment is beautiful, clean and minimalistic, just out of a pinterest board. Honestly the pictures do not justify how nice the apartment is. And the room is clean and well maintained. Personally I loved how clean the bed spreads and pillows were. she left me some goodies on the table as well. The location is perfect, all the main spots are within 20 to 30min walking distance. I had an amazing time walking around the city. "
4404126,46659613,2015-09-12,42806583,Kevin,"Lily was a great host. She made went out of her way to make sure we could get the keys. Even when we were late, she still was flexible enough to make things work. She even got my girlfriend and I an anniversary gift. Place was nice and clean. Very conveniently located. Easy walk to most of things we wanted to do in downtown Seattle. She on top of that was a very interesting person and we had a nice conversation with her. Highly recommended and would stay again any day. "
4404126,46801001,2015-09-13,14213171,Bodil,"The only downside about Lilys place is that the WiFi doesn't work in the bedroom. Everything else is simply perfect: the location, the cleanliness, the comfort, and a nice friendly host who cannot wait to give you her recommendations for where to go and what to do while in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
4404126,49045988,2015-09-30,44023294,Mayra,"I booked my room with Lily a few weeks before my actual trip. She was very kind, helpful and accessible. The apartment itself was super adorable, and quaint. The pictures truly do not do it justice. The location was ideal, we walked to the market, local coffee shops and dining establishments. I took and 8$ uber ride to Safeco Field and a $15 to Alki beach. It was a perfect location, in my opinion. Also, a great tequila bar is within walking distance. Lily was super nice, and fun to talk to. She even left a cute care package for my arrival with wine, and  snacks from local businesses. I am sad, I did not get a chance to drink the wine! But, I definitely will go back to Seattle someday. Thank you lily. "
4404126,49507156,2015-10-04,14021605,Camille,Lily is a wonderful host- you will feel very comfortable and welcome there.  The location is fantastic- so easy to get around on foot or with public transportation.  Very cool neighborhood.

She is also very personable and offers great resources and tips to help navigate your visit. I highly recommend Lily and would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
4404126,52003668,2015-10-25,33699077,Cindy,"Lily is an amazing host! She left for a business trip so I didn't meet her until my last night in Seattle, but she went out of her way to make me feel welcomed and comfortable the whole time. I was greeted with a thoughtful gift basket filled with snacks and a bottle of wine! Whenever I had a question and texted her, she replied immediately. After my shower, I realized that there was no hair blow dryer in the bathroom, so she texted her neighbors to see if anyone could lend me one. Also, the location is super close to downtown and there's a convenient parking structure one block away that only charges $5 to park overnight during the weekends. Overall, a wonderful experience and I would stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! "
4404126,53006874,2015-11-03,41659757,Theresa,"Lily was an exceptionally welcoming host! I was visiting Seattle for a residency interview, and she showed me around the neighborhood and the hospital I would be interviewing at the next morning. My room was immaculate and stylishly furnished. I had everything I needed and was extremely pleased with my stay. Lily even offered me a bottle of local wine, though sadly I was unable to try it due to my short stay-- I hope her next guest will be able to enjoy it!"

Even though I was only there for a day/night, Lily was a fantastic host and made my first stay in Seattle very enjoyable. I will definitely be back again. Thanks, Lily!"
4404126,54326940,2015-11-18,3496521,Alli,"Lily was an absolute delight. The apartment is presented as described, Lily was easy to communicate with, gave me accurate directions, welcomed me to her home and shared some of her favorite spots and tips for my short stay in Seattle. I can't recommend Lily highly enough - I was comfortable and warm in the apartment, it's in the perfect location for lots of walking and exploring, restaurants, cafes, bars and arts. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be back during the warmer months!"
4404126,54918329,2015-11-25,26034174,Tina Tianyi,"The first experience has always been important for people and I got to say I feel so lucky to meet Lily and stay at her place. It was such a wonderful and joyful trip, and part of it is definitely because of the warm welcome by Lily! She even prepared lots of snacks and a bunch of stuff that I can use in case I don't bring any. The description is quite accurate, and there are a bunch of issues that Lily have warned me before the trip but turned out to be nothing at all (maybe because I am a easy person). The building looks old but for tourist, what matters more is the location. Lily's place has an awesome view of entire downtown area, and is so closed to my favorite seafood restaurant and coffee place (just turned to be my favorite). Will recommend to my friend and I am so looking forward to seeing her again for my next trip!"
4404126,55818724,2015-12-06,9351195,Kyle,"It was a very short but sweet stay at Lily's apartment; I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle! Lily was extremely nice and helpful, and her apartment is adorable, clean, and in an excellent location. Street noise was not an issue for me at all, I didn't even need my earplugs. Thanks for the hospitality Lily! "
4404126,56082633,2015-12-08,47935220,Meriah,"I was in town for a few days for an interview. Lily was extremely gracious to meet me later than expected since my flights were delayed. She was very responsive to my communication prior to arrival. She was also very thorough in explaining how to get settled, the best path to my interview location and even some things to do in the area. She had even written me a note to help me get oriented. Her home was clean, well supplied with towels and some snacks, and very comfortable. Lily was a joy to get to meet and I would highly recommend her!"
4404126,56571596,2015-12-14,27777088,Kait,This was my first air bnb experience and it was wonderful! Lily was very easy to get a hold of and her place was so cute with great views out of the front windows. She provided everything I needed like towels and special little surprises like a basket of local goods and a space heater for additional warmth. Lily is a great host and really fun to talk to. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely return the next time I'm in Seattle! :) 
1354750,22639048,2014-11-10,1161492,Robert,"Such a great little apartment right in the heart of Capitol Hill. Tons of privacy and safe. Nice, comfortable bed and a full kitchen with is great because it is 2 minute walk to a Safeway. Great restaurants and bars close by. I almost don't want to talk it up too much because I want it to be available next time I'm in Seattle! Would highly recommend if it's available, get it now. Very nice hosts to top it off."
1354750,22931821,2014-11-17,23592322,Bonnie,"Jack was a very warm host, making sure that I got into Seattle okay and letting me know what was going on with the public transport system on my arrival day. The place had a surprisingly amount of light that came through the windows, and the bathroom was stocked with shampoo, soap, towels, and the like (a very nice touch!) It's within walking distance to anything in capitol hill and has easy access to buses. There's a Safeway grocery store right next door, making getting groceries to cook in the lovely kitchen very easy. "
1354750,23140464,2014-11-23,22026275,Eric,"This is a great gem. Perfect location in Capitol Hill. It's on a quiet street, but easy walking access to anywhere I needed to go. It was larger than I expected. Though I didn't use it, there's a full kitchen with stove, the bedroom and full bath. It is a basement, but felt more like an apartment. There are windows all around, which is cool for natural light, but you will have the occasional person walk past. Close the blinds and you won't notice.

One last huge bonus, the hosts are really nice. I accidentally left my toothbrush there. I got a quick text soon after I checked out telling me about it, and they even offered to mail it to me. I was still in town, but good, genuine vibe all around."
1354750,23195934,2014-11-24,2498316,James,Jack is a great host. You won't find a better place for the price!
1354750,23708480,2014-12-08,23908035,Matt,Everything was wonderful. We even had cookware for making breakfast.  They gave us great suggestions for places to eat. I would definitely stay there again.
1354750,25336657,2015-01-12,17878401,Neil,"Jack was very accommodating and easy to coordinate with. He made my second AirBnB experience very seamless and is very responsive as well. His place was perfect for the one night I was there, is clean and tidy, and in a great part of Capitol Hill so the bars, restaurants, and shops I wanted to go were close by. Thanks again Jack!"
1354750,25552298,2015-01-19,7434162,Kelly,"Awesome location, super easy to work with! "
1354750,26323951,2015-02-09,521985,Karianne,"We didn't get to meet Jack but Jessica was super helpful and accommodating. Their place was well-located, cute, and comfortable. It can be difficult parking in that neighbourhood so the parking pass was very appreciated. Would definitely stay again!"
1354750,26621698,2015-02-16,26608520,Andrew,"Cute little basement apartment. My girlfriend and I were amazed how close it was to the 8, 10, and 43 lines. Plenty of great food and drink spots nearby. The house was clean and the hosts were friendly! "
1354750,27037254,2015-02-23,27893224,Ashley,"Very cute place, and great central location! The building is really beautiful. Bus to downtown is super close, which was convenient since we were heading to the EMP. Close to plenty of restaurants, we had an excellent breakfast at Witness, which was a ~5 minute walk. Hosts were also stellar, very helpful and relaxed. They lent us their parking pass, which was really nice since it would have been pricey to park elsewhere. We had a great time, would definitely stay again and recommend to others!"
1354750,27281531,2015-03-01,27408021,Heloise,"Great place to stay, safe and quiet.
Owners have a lovely sense of detail (guests towels, empty bins, fire alarm checked and replaced, basic toiletries available...)"
1354750,27341192,2015-03-02,11025509,Lee,Great place with excellent neighborhood.  Everything we needed was within reach.  Thanks Jack and family for a great stay.  And I really appreciate the guest parking pass!
1354750,27966230,2015-03-15,28842967,Jeff,"Our stay was short but jack and his family were very flexible for check in and checkout. The apartment was well furnished and very clean, I would stay here again with out a doubt."
1354750,28040954,2015-03-16,15188241,Kristin,"We got greeted at the door right when we arrived! The suite is exactly as pictured. The location is fantastic, but parking can be a be tricky. A guest parking pass was provided, but it can still be slightly challenging to find a spot. The milk, coffee, and tea and other kitchen basics were great. Every thing was clean. Thank you!"
1354750,29345542,2015-04-06,6802054,Colin,"The location was great, a couple bars/restaurants starting a block away. good places on Olive Way district? or area? is also within walking distance, The Pike/pine area if you are into that are also a short walk away down broadway. The number 15 bus is a block away to downtown. 
The shower was nice and I am a convert to the Kirkland brand shampoo they had and the towels were quality too. The guest parking pass was also crucial in that area. The place is pretty spartan as far as comfort goes, but I guess that will make you want to get out and explore the city more. The only other downside is the wi-fi connection could be better, streaming a show on netflix is pretty much out of the question. Again more reason to get out and explore. I would recommend the Hopvine pub on 15th a block away
Overall this place is well worth it for the money and the local vibe you get from that part of Capitol Hill."
1354750,32527551,2015-05-19,2693806,Prithvi,Jack was a great host! He stayed late to let us check in and had all of the essentials ready for us. The location is also very convenient and close to a number of restaurants.  
1354750,33713997,2015-05-31,5226546,Laura,"Jessica and Jack were great hosts and we loved the apartment and location!! We would definitely stay there again next time we are in Seattle. You are within walking distance to many great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops and we even walked from the apartment down to the market/downtown area. Definitely recommend this place to others looking for a comfortable, clean, quiet location in the city."
1354750,33804348,2015-06-01,20937619,Jacob,"I ran into a couple of setbacks on my way to Jack's place, but he was very good with communication and very accommodating. The apartment was cozy, clean, and was the neighborhood was fantastic. Jack wasn't kidding about the walkability score being a billion. Next time I'm in Seattle and need a place to stay, I'm definitely going to see if this listing is available! Thanks Jack!"
1354750,34415134,2015-06-08,7140832,Micah,"Perfect little place in a great neighbourhood. Easy walk to restaurants, coffee shops and bookstores on 15th and 19th."
1354750,34940310,2015-06-14,11062,David,Jack was very helpful and the apartment was clean and central to seattle as advertised 
1354750,35076926,2015-06-15,13325677,Elaine,"Apartment was in a great location, quiet, clean."
1354750,35965549,2015-06-23,12319461,Joseph,"Jack's place was ideal- very comfortable, and described very accurately.  The neighborhood was great,  lots of restaurants (Jack was very kind and gave us some suggestions). We recommend highly!"
1354750,36513911,2015-06-29,23301474,Jodi,Great overall experience. Simple check in & out. 
1354750,44282353,2015-08-25,18420197,Kurt,"This was a lovely little in-city getaway. We parked our car on the street with a guest parking pass and didn't drive for four days! The apartment is within walking distance (both near and not-so-near) of shops and restaurants, cafes and museums. We even walked to the opera house (about 40 minutes). The bed was super comfortable and we had everything we needed."
1354750,45239091,2015-09-01,6163989,Veronica,"Staying at Jack and Jessica's was a great experience. The apartment was just as pictured and very cozy. I really appreciated their flexible check in time; they made it very easy with Jessica being at home to hand the keys off when my boyfriend and I got there and we simply left the keys on the counter when we left. 
The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable and the neighbourhood was quiet but very close to everything one could want from being on Capitol Hill.
I look forward to returning to Seattle and staying again."
1354750,46123989,2015-09-08,20830406,Caleb,He's very friendly and helpful and the space is exactly what we needed as described. Will rent from him again. 
3940265,18925442,2014-09-02,2582812,Karl,Great place and welcoming host. Easy access via keyless entry. In a convenient location to go downtown.
3940265,19253722,2014-09-08,4265904,Val,"This was a great room to stay in, in a lovely neighbourhood. The room was even nicer than I had been expecting from the listing, and the keyless lock was extremely convenient. The top floor deck had beautiful views of the area. I never actually met Summer - I guess she was away for the weekend."
3940265,19487383,2014-09-13,20699937,Vickram,"Had a very comfortable stay in Summer's House. It was clean, comfortable and cozy and at a great location. Summer was also a very good host."
3940265,19631895,2014-09-15,20695957,Stephanie,"Great comfortable room, in a perfect location. We loved that it was within minutes of the tourist attractions we wanted to see, but was far enough to be quiet and find street parking. The room was comfy and clean. We only stayed for a weekend so we spent most of our time out about the city, and only came to the room to sleep, and we were out again pretty early in the mornings so I wasn't able to meet with Summer, but at no fault of hers! Had we stayed longer I would have loved to interact. Overall a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend!!"
3940265,20045641,2014-09-22,20900725,Mark,This weekend far exceeded my expectations. Summer and her spouse are lovely people and a pleasure to be around.  Room and bed are very comfortable. Cats are friendly and eccentric. What a great location and area. Would love to visit again!
3940265,20516588,2014-09-30,1355275,Paola,"Great location, excellent room/house, very nice people and cats. "
3940265,20719984,2014-10-04,1355275,Paola,"Great location, excellent room/house, very nice people and cats. "
3940265,21311341,2014-10-14,21939489,Tracy,Great location. Loved the keyless entry. The room was very comfortable and I would recommend this rental to others!
3940265,21628077,2014-10-20,22318981,Daniel,Summer was great.  Very friendly with good tips.
3940265,22405434,2014-11-05,22347352,Kerry,"This was a great place to stay and exceeded my expectations. The document Summer provided prior to arrival was valuable and thorough. The keyless entry was easy to use and the room was easy-in-and-out, located next to the door. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was firm and comfortable. I hung my clothes in the closet and put others in the small dresser. My toiletries went in a medicine cabinet. There was helpful tourist info on a side table. The bathroom was well stocked, including amenities like soaps and shampoos normally found in hotels. I was also able to use the kitchen to make tea in the morning and pop corn in the evening. Summer was very friendly and helpful and greeted me upon arrival. She provided an umbrella and even looked for water-resistant shoes for me among her personal collection since I had neither. Her cats were friendly and well-behaved. There was no odor of cats, which some cat homes have. The neighborhood was quiet and contained many houses which had been turned into apartments. There was a coffee shop just a few doors away, and a nice grocery store and deli a short walk away. Bus stops were also nearby. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the need arose."
3940265,22687103,2014-11-11,4211692,Saki,"Great location: easy public transportation to downtown, awesome restaurant a couple blocks away. Great views from the rooftop!!

Very comfortable: room and private bathroom are very nice, efficient spaces. Bedding is soft and cozy.

The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The cats are hilarious and provided great entertainment but easy to keep out of the room if you're not interested."
3940265,24110567,2014-12-20,9009347,Benjamin,"This was my second stay with Summer (previously in their other airbnb listing upstairs) and an equally wonderful experience. Everything is as described. Highlights compared to other airbnb experiences include: detailed and useful pre-arrival document with directions from airport, wifi, etc.; keyless entry allows for any arrival time; private 3/4 bath makes this an excellent value relative to other listings; closet clear and with hangers every helpful since my trip was 3 weeks.

Work brings me to Seattle many times each year, and for several weeks each time. This listing (or Summer's very similar ""green (a)"" listing) is the first place I check each time."
3940265,25055244,2015-01-05,24581260,Gerardo,"Summer and Jay were awesome, they were extremely friendly and helpful, they were happy to help and chat about anything but they also provided us with the privacy of a proper hotel. The bed was awesome and the bathroom was well provisioned.

Close to public transportation, the key-less entry was awesome as we arrived at 1am, this is definitely a 5 stars place."
3940265,26916285,2015-02-22,9009347,Benjamin,"This was my third stay  with Summer (2nd in this room which is just as described). I travel to Seattle regularly for work and this remains my first choice accommodation.

Everything always goes very smoothly, space is very comfortable, highly recommended."
3940265,28818094,2015-03-30,29005800,Tom,"Summer and Jay were welcoming and friendly. The room was quiet and comfortable, on a quiet residential street about 20 minutes walk from downtown. I'd certainly stay here again if/when I'm next in Seattle."
3940265,29203337,2015-04-05,22696542,Joe,"Very easy and convenient. The room was very nice and having its own bathroom was a big plus. Summer was very accommodating, answering all my questions in a timely manner. Combined with a great neighborhood, I'd recommend this room highly!"
3940265,29780353,2015-04-12,24667765,Laura,"The place was very nice and clean, with all of the accommodations.  Room was private, as it is downstairs.  The kitties were friendly.  "
3940265,30839963,2015-04-27,512032,Sarita,"Loved our stay! Summer and jay have the perfect setup! Great location, nice spacious, comfy bedroom. Having an ensuite bathroom was a nice plus! Kitties are sweet and friendly. Will definitely stay here again!"
3940265,31386809,2015-05-04,31838420,Dee Anne,"Even though Summer wasn't yet home when we got there, directions for entering worked perfectly, and the welcome committee of Kitties was there to greet us!  Everything was very clean, comfortable, and just as it was listed.  Summer is a gracious hostess, fun to talk with, and helpful with everything we needed.  Fridge space, dishes, everything was available for our use, as we wanted to make our own meals rather than eating out - it was so nice!  Summer even shared some delicious, fresh, home-made banana bread!  Summer's home is in a good residential neighborhood but also well-located for getting around the city.  The on-street parking in the neighborhood is well-used on the weekend & after work hours, but we always found a space to park that was close-by.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and everything was just right and very pleasant.  We'd definitely recommend Summer's home for a nice stay in Seattle.    Thank you for everything, Summer!"
3940265,34297079,2015-06-07,9009347,Benjamin,"I stay with Summer regularly on business trips to Seattle. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Everything is as described and always goes smoothly. I continue to look here first for my own trips, and recommend staying to friends and colleagues."
3940265,34967640,2015-06-14,5438967,Cody,"Summer's home was exactly as described. The bedroom was plenty big for two adults, and the attached bathroom was convenient. We needed to put our bags in the house early on our check-in day, and Summer was very accommodating and let us do this. The three cats are very friendly and made friends with us immediately. The neighborhood is nice and was very convenient for us. There is a great coffee shop just a couple of doors down. We would definitely stay here again. "
3940265,35354577,2015-06-17,2496212,Stacy,"A lovely stay! What a great neighborhood. Great Coffee shop and Trader Joes were walking distance. The tree cats were very charming and entertaining, and Summer and James were great hosts. We did not need a car. We were dropped and later picked up by a Lyft driver. The walk down hill to major restaurants and shops was nice."
3940265,35792219,2015-06-22,4134628,Kevin & Jennifer,"We never met Summer, but the room was great and quiet. It was easy to get into the house and the cats were super friendly. The location was also fantastic. The neighborhood was fun and We would definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle."
3940265,36797904,2015-07-01,14316146,Veronica & Neil,"We absolutely loved staying at Summer's place. Cleanliness is our top concern when booking Airbnb and our bedroom and private bathroom were impeccable. The location was also awesome. Right there on Pike St. with tons of restaurants and shops. Just a 30-minute walk and you are downtown. It was really great. Summer was super nice and all her kitties were soooo sweet! Shuksan was the friendliest of all. He was very loving!
Everything was very nice. Summer also provided clean towels (face, hand and body), shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, body soap, Qtips... even make up removing towels! She was very thoughtful and a great guest!
We definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Seattle!"
3940265,37766313,2015-07-10,9966644,Barbara,"our stay with Summer has been my worst airbnb experience ever! 
when we arrived, our room was already taken by an other guest who told us, there was an other room which we could take.  we did so and Summer confirmed this was ok. 
Once back home, Summer has cleaned our room (with all our private stuff in it) and left us a note to change room - That's not what I'd call respecting our privacy. 
What came on top, was the cat poop on the floor, when we arrived as well as the fact that Summer and her husband didn't care about keeping the kitchen clean (dirty dishes) or avoiding loud noise at night when the guests are already asleep.

other than this, the room is as described.
"
3940265,38287488,2015-07-14,34846500,Dan,Great location for us as it was only a few blocks from our sons condo. Very clean and provided all we needed for the nights we were there. Found street parking and no permit required. Our hosts provided acces to the tv upstairs so we could wind down with a good movie each night.
3940265,38791668,2015-07-18,4115513,Eric,"During my last trip to Seattle I stayed in Summer's home, and the next time I go I will definitely check if this is an option. The location was ideal for me as there was convenient access to downtown and UW on the Madison ST and 23rd Ave bus lines. The coffee shop down the street was great; lots of locals going in. 

I think Summer rents at least one other bedroom, so were several people coming and going. Key-less entry was really nice as it removes the need for exchanging keys, and I was able to come and go as I needed. It seemed like other guest were able to arrive early in the morning.

The room I used was clean and comfortable. There was a full private bathroom (shower, sink, toilet) in the room that was well stocked with towels, soap, shampoo, etc. 

Finally, while there were several cats running around, they were very friendly."
3940265,41084230,2015-08-04,34767457,Alison,"This was my first personal experience with airbnb and I would definitely stay at Summer's place again.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The neighborhood is quiet but has easy access to all Capitol Hill has to offer.  Summer and Jay were accommodating and friendly hosts.  The kitty co-hosts were especially friendly, and I enjoyed the company they provided on the rooftop deck with the great view of Mt. Rainier. Positive experience all around."
3940265,41358455,2015-08-07,2245112,Inki,"Summer and Jay were great hosts! They were very accessible and welcoming since the day we arrived. Their home was located in a very quite village in Capitol Hill, yet not very far from where things were happening. The room was conveniently located on the first floor to secure the privacy of the guest along with the private bathroom that was attached to it. Much thanks to Summer and Jay for being such a nice host and the place is 100% recommended and we would love to come back for next visit!"
3940265,42398514,2015-08-13,20698959,Keith,"Both Summer and Jay were both very welcoming and provided useful information about the area. The accommodation was very clean and extremely comfortable, the ensuite a real bonus.  Location was handy to transport, food store and restaurants. The cats were very friendly."
3940265,43093428,2015-08-17,24802996,Tiffany,"My experience with Summer and her private room was more than wonderful. The room itself is in a great, safe location near Capitol Hill and walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. It was near the bus, so getting to downtown and pretty much everywhere else was easy. The room is VERY cozy with lots of blankets and pillows. There are plenty of outlets around the room. The closet has extra towels and blankets if necessary too. The bathroom is small with the 1/2 bath, but she provides shampoo/conditioner, hair dryer, Q-tips, and soap. It was nice having the keylesss entry too. Summer let me stay in the room past check-in time (no one booked for the day we left) which was nice because our bus to Portland left at 1 PM and we had time to explore and leave our bags in the room. Summer told me she was away for the weekend, but I heard people upstairs so I was not sure if there were other renters or she just decided to stay home. Nonetheless, it was very private and quiet. If you leave your door open, her cats come and visit you. They are nice and playful! If you are leaving the room to explore, you can just tell them to leave and they will listen :) I highly recommend this place and next time I come back, this will be the first place I will try to request"
3940265,44697694,2015-08-28,21192858,Rebecca,"Summer was super nice and welcoming! I saw her on some of the days I was staying there (I stayed there for 4 days) and she was always friendly. Her cats are adorable too. She was also flexible about my reserving the dates ahead of time even though I couldn't pay her immediately, which I'm really grateful for!
The room was exactly as shown in the photos, and had enough space for me and my boyfriend to sprawl out four suitcases' worth of things. The location is within walkable distance of cafes and breakfast places and bus stops too."
3940265,45500162,2015-09-03,31945660,Vanessa,"This was my first experience using Airbnb, and I totally enjoyed my stay at Summer and Jay's home. The room was clean, comfortable, and very private. I loved having our own bathroom this was a plus!! The location was perfect, in walking distace to restaurants, bars, 15min walk to downtown. Very close to public transportation aswell. I loved the visits that we would get from the kitty's in the mornings, very friendly and lovable. I would definitely recommend staying here, and would love to come back for my next visit."
3940265,47823052,2015-09-21,39722801,Pohjolan Talo,"Staying at Summer was a pleasant experience, her place is very lovely and welcoming, well designed for airbnb-ers (a private room with its own bathroom, door access code). I was welcomed by three cats, who guided me through the house and were a great company to me. The place is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood, close to the Seattle downtown and all the Capitol Hill restaurants.  I would gladly at Summer's place again."

3940265,49833221,2015-10-06,8609814,Michael,"Une chambre, avec salle de bain privÃ©e, vraiment confortable et propre.
Le quartier est calme. 
La ligne de bus numÃ©ro 2 vous amÃ¨ne directement Ã  Downtown (attention, ne vous fiez pas aux horaires de passage, l'attente peut Ãªtre un peu longue. Surtout prÃ©voyez l'appoint, c'est 2,50$ ! Car aucune machine ou commerces aux alentours ne vendent de billets!)
Ã cÃ´tÃ© de la maison se trouve un cafÃ© fort sympathique pour vos petits dÃ©jeuners (Tougo Coffee), avec un accueil chaleureux et un bien bel endroit moderne et agrÃ©able!
Maintenant, mon seul regret fut le peu de contact et d'intÃ©rÃªt portÃ© par mes hÃ´tes. Tout est fait pour limite n'avoir aucune interaction avec eux. De l'accÃ¨s Ã  la maison sans clÃ© (digicode), la chambre est au rÃªve de chaussÃ© juste Ã  l'entrÃ©e, le fait que j'ai briÃ¨vement discutÃ© avec l'hÃ´te 5min (j'ai dÃ» parcourir la maison pour le trouver car personne n'Ã©tait lÃ  pour m'accueillir) et surtout que je n'ai eu aucun contact avec eux Ã  mon dÃ©part. Ce fut une rÃ©elle dÃ©ception ; je choisis systÃ©matiquement Airbnb pour le cÃ´tÃ© chaleureux et humain avec mes hÃ´tes, et lÃ  je ne l'ai pas retrouvÃ©. Dommage."

3940265,51576420,2015-10-21,10182066,Anna,"My experience at Summer's home was amazing! The private room was very comfortable and roomy. I really enjoyed the white noise machine, power outlet with USB ports, info on cool things to do in Seattle, and the super cute cats that greeted us from time to time. It was just a short walk to tons of tasty food and shops, too! Thanks for everything!"
3940265,55267689,2015-11-29,48726002,Jiaxin,Nice place to stay. Quiet and clean. Love the cats. 
4809486,45026503,2015-08-30,7650376,Rose,We stayed with Mario and Kevin in their upscale townhouse in a new and booming neighborhood.  Mario greeted us and helped us get settled in.  The dogs were very welcoming and since we like dogs we enjoyed their greetings.  We had a restful nights sleep in a very comfortable quiet room and a delicious cup of espresso in the morning.
4809486,46429594,2015-09-10,38008938,Jemima,"Keith and Mario are very kind and friendly hosts who made me feel very welcome. The room is very comfortable and nicely decorated. Their dogs are nice too and the neighbourhood is a good location for visitors, and I hope to come back one day."
4809486,48584562,2015-09-27,29406411,Melissa,"Mario and Keith's place is just as depicted: modern, quiet, stylish and comfortable. And all of the regular inhabitants are delightfully gracious (extra pats to Mocha and Vito!)  Keith and Mario were terrific about helping me get wherever I needed to go - I really appreciated their availability and quick response with directions and advice. West Seattle has so much to offer, and their place is also very accessible to downtown via bus if you're without a car. There is an enormous green space right across the street that is full of trails, and once you're done wandering, eating, shopping, or just experiencing things there is an amazingly comfortable bed to fall into - I had a great weekend, thanks to their very warm hospitality."
4809486,49179014,2015-10-01,1657457,Erin,"Keith and Mario were very friendly and welcoming. I stayed in their home for a work week while I went on job interviews and went house hunting. They were helpful with information on different neighborhoods and West Seattle in particular, and made me feel at welcome to use the kitchen or other common areas in the house as much as I wanted. Their dogs were adorable and friendly. The bedroom and private bathroom felt like a lovely hotel room with a very comfortable bed, fast wi-fi and plenty of closet for my interview clothing. 

On street parking was always available (free) and the location was great for both the commercial area of West Seattle as well as access to the West Seattle bridge and the rest of the city.

If I need to go back to Seattle for any reason prior to my permanent relocation, I would absolutely stay here again. "
890677,3518963,2013-02-11,4866022,Laurent,"We have been staying at Rob and Carol's place in early Feb 2013. We were 4 hosts, visiting Seattle for business and leisure.
We had a wonderful stay. The house is perfect for 2 to 4 persons, with 2 different rooms and 2 bothrooms. The place is nicely decorated and there are all the required amenities.
The house is very central in Capitol Hill, just off Broadway Street. Everything is at a walking distance, including the city center.
Lastly, Rob has been very helpful to us to organize our stay.


"
890677,3908087,2013-03-26,5196978,Kim,We thoroughly enjoyed our two evenings and mornings in the Wilsons' lovely Condo.  The hosts left us a bottle of wine and made everything very easy.  The place is beautifully decorated with every creature comfort.  It is located a block off of Broadway in Capitol Hill and just down the street from our son's apartment so it was perfect for us and we may want to stay there again on our next visit.  We managed to bring along weather from sunny Florida so our trip was perfect.  Thanks for everything.
890677,4066318,2013-04-07,5260537,Idelisse,"We were a group of 6. The house was beautiful and accommodated us very well. The house is just one block away from a grocery store and public transportation to downtown. The neighborhood is fun, full of restaurants and little shops. The hospitality of the people in charge of the house was excellent."
890677,4280967,2013-04-24,1770035,Adam,"My friends and I planned a food and drink adventure starting in Willamette Valley with a stop in Portland before finishing up in Seattle and this place was the perfect end to our trip!  Rob and Carol were perfect hosts and I cannot say enough about how great their place is.  It is a fantastic location, only a block or two from coffee shops, supermarket, and restaurants and a quick cab ride downtown.  They were very informative and even left cookies for us when we arrived!  Make sure to have a drink on the roof-top terrace - the view is fantastic!"
890677,4336408,2013-04-29,4273071,Leslie,Rob & Carol were great hosts. There home was very comfortable. The house had everything we needed for our girls road trip get away. We walked to Pikes Place Market & back. Also there was a bus stop near to everywhere we wanted to go. If you are looking for a great place to stay when you travel to Seattle you should really consider staying at Rob & Carol's wonderful home. I will defiantly stay here again. Thank you Rob & Carol for wonderful hospitality.   
890677,4471328,2013-05-07,986822,Kim & Mary,Rob and Carol were very helpful and accommodating. They picked our party up from the airport. They gave us useful information about the neighborhood. It was a good location to walk around and it was easy to get to other areas that we wanted to visit. The place was well stocked and suited our party of 4 well. Thanks for being just a good Airbnb find!
890677,4634051,2013-05-17,842518,Sarah,"We stayed at Rob and Carol's house while having our hardwood floors refinished. We live about 10 blocks away so we know the neighborhood well and Rob and Carol's house is the absolute best of all worlds for location : a 10 second walk to one of the best streets of restaurants, bars, and shopping in Seattle, yet quiet and neighborhoody as a street full of single-family homes and gorgeous landscaping (plus one of seattle's best parks a short walk down the street). Rob and Carol met me as they left on a road trip and were lovely and friendly, showing me all the comforts of the home. They even left a jar of coffee from my favorite local roaster for my husband (coffee snob) and I to enjoy fresh from the grinder. The house has a fantastic layout - 4 stories including a wonderful rooftop deck- and so many trees outside every window that it feels like a treehouse. Sunlight pours through huge windows on the second floor (where you spend most of your time as it has the open kitchen and living/dining room) , and is a wonderful space to cook and socialize in. We felt like we were on vacation with the luxury of a massive stove and cable TV and comfy couch to watch our Netflix from. The house was impeccably clean with brand-new carpet, and could accommodate 6 people easily and privately, as bedrooms and bathrooms are on upper levels of the house with a neat half-story between the 2nd and 3rd floors. There are also decks off every room, and on the beautiful spring days we were there gave us the treat of watching the foot traffic walk by below. Rob and Carol obviously love and care for their home and have decorated it with treasures and antiques from their travels. Can't recommend the place, location, and hosts highly enough. "
890677,4828219,2013-05-28,2231624,James,"My friend Alistair and I stayed at Rob and Carol's apartment over Memorial Day weekend. Before we even arrived in Seattle I knew we were going to have the best time, as Rob's quick and succinct responses to any queries I had before my trip totally put my mind at ease. We arranged to meet at the baggage area where he and Carol would drive us from the airport to the apartment. This was awfully courteous and much appreciated, especially as they were going camping that evening themselves.

Then the apartment, what can I say? Two large double bedrooms, three bathrooms, each room with a balcony, roof terrace with a view of the space needle, lounge with 50 inch TV, and huge kitchen, perfect for a morning fry up. All impeccably decorated and with a real story to tell from their own lives travelling, which was quite inspiring. 

Rob and Carol are big coffee enthusiasts, and Alistair assures me that the Ethiopian coffee left for us is up there with the best he's ever had.

The location is fantastic, 30 seconds to Broadway, which holds many restaurants, I recommend the Rom Mai Thai Cuisine, which is about two minutes away. The supermarket is also two minutes away and caters for pretty much every need. You are about a 30 minute walk from downtown Seattle which was not a big deal for us. There are buses from Broadway if you so wish. 

Rob and Carol themselves were very informative, caring hosts and we will only take wonderful memories from their splendid home. We thank them for an unforgettable experience."
890677,5017914,2013-06-08,1221173,Alex,"Very desirable house/apt ... owners vacated while we were there. Carol invited us to use supplies, which we generally didn't but we did prepare some meals and it was comforting to be back-stopped by a well-stocked, gourmet kitchen. We loved the neighborhood, at the base of Capitol Hill; lively Broadway one block west (w 2 impt bus routes) and a lovely park w Seattle Asian Art Museum (and Bruce Lee's grave!) maybe a sedate 1/2 mile walk NE through a residential neighborhood. Driveway parking = priceless on Capitol Hill. "
890677,5205110,2013-06-18,2402986,Barbara,"Rob and Carol have a beautiful, unique home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Though a busy, noisy neighborhood, their location is  very quiet. Their directions and  neighborhood tips were spot-on and they were quick returning emails regarding questions or concerns we had. The house itself was bright and lovely with loads of space. We chatted just as I was leaving and they could not be nicer people.
My husband and I certainly hope to return!
"
890677,5359826,2013-06-26,5187903,Terry,"Wonderful cozy place to stay. Centrally located to markets, bus line & market. Dining is nearby, as well as places to visits.  Location to Zipcar is two blocks away. UBER is also available.  Rob & Carol are great hosts; they have much information available as well as a booklet about the house (ie: television, heat/ cooling, waste pickup, etc).  There of us stayed there and enjoyed the home and it's wonderful antiques.  Rob advised us to take the LINK train after we landed and he met us there to take us to his home and showed  us around.  Great time.
"
890677,5447795,2013-07-01,1607557,Kaaren,"We had a wonderful stay at Rob and Carol's apartment. We are a family of five, and wanted a place with lots of coffee houses and shopping and atmosphere to explore. There was room for everyone to sleep comfortably, and easy bus access to the main sights. The apartment was a welcome sanctuary after long days of walking around town. The neighborhood is lively, and can be noisy, but it was quieter on their street. THere is a grocery store a couple of blocks away, so staying for a couple days without a car was simple. The roof deck had a nice view, though it was so hot when we were there it was impossible to sit up there without an umbrella. Nice problem to have in Seattle! We would definitely stay there again."
890677,6100205,2013-07-30,4143229,Brent,"This house couldn't have been more perfect! We stayed with our four kids for about a month. We had plenty of room in this clean, beautifully decorated place. The house is three levels and has a rooftop deck with a great view of Mt Rainier, downtown, and the top of the space needle. The house is in a great neighborhood and close to everything. No need for a car here as everything you could need is within walking distance, including downtown(15-20 min). Grocery stores, restaurants/bars, coffee, shopping, parks are all within a few blocks.  Public transportation is also good in this area as several bus lines are nearby. If you do have a car, there is a driveway which is a big plus in this neighborhood. 

You couldn't ask for better hosts than Rob and Carol. They were very responsive to the emails I sent, and made sure our stay was a great one I would definitely recommend this place.

"
890677,7617515,2013-09-27,1209522,Karen,"What a wonderful place to stay! I can't recommend it highly enough.

Rob & Carol are great hosts: informative, communicative and friendly. It was very nice to be welcomed & shown around.

The house is beautiful, clean, comfortable & has all you need. Sipping local wine on the roof terrace admiring the view of the Space Needle was a particular highlight of our trip!

The area is perfect too. Capitol Hill has everything nearby, so there is no need to leave the area if you don't want to. But of course you will want to explore & its great as a base. Good public transport plus near enough to walk/taxi (cabs to most main tourist things about $10).

Tip: if you like going to movies check out this nearby place. It's way better than your average theater (website hidden)"
890677,9013013,2013-12-02,1698850,Ellen,"We stayed here for 2 months to have a more in depth experience of the Emerald city.  Couldn't have chosen a better location than this one. Beautiful and cozy home with all the amenities one could wish for.  Extremely clean and fresh. Close to a big grocery store, Starbucks, gym, yoga and all kinds of restaurants one could wish for. Walking distance to downtown. Rob and Carol are passionate, smart and down to earth hosts. Rob's niece Jeneva couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Highly recommended."
890677,9126531,2013-12-09,5341453,Lisa,"Rob and Carol's home was bright, clean, comfortable, and perfect for a weekend with friends in Seattle.  Can't beat the location on Capital Hill - with easy access to everything, an easy parking spot and you are a stones throw from your choice of coffee shops.  Would love to book this a place again!  Thank you!"
890677,15538780,2014-07-11,10255854,Artie,"Our family's stay at Rob and Carol's home was very enjoyable. It was clean, homey, and spacious, with all the amenities, including comfortable mattresses. The trees outside the windows made it feel like you weren't even in the middle of a city.

The neighborhood is extremely convenient and quirky - the good kind of quirky. You don't need a car as restaurants, markets, and shops are just steps away. But if you have a car, off-street parking is available.

Rob and Carol are excellent hosts. Rob couldn't meet us there, but he took great care to make sure everything was properly prepared and well-communicated to ensure a good stay. There's even a well-written guide to their home and neighborhood on the table! 

I couldn't recommend Rob & Carol or their place highly enough. I'd love to stay there again."
890677,15634206,2014-07-13,16285806,Carrie,"I have nothing but praise for this gem of a home. Rob and Carol were very helpful before and during our visit and my only regret is that we didn't get a chance to meet them during our stay. The house is incredibly charming and very comfortable. We enjoyed all of the opportunities to step out on to private decks, especially with the unusually warm weather. We were provided with a booklet containing all we needed to know about the house and the neighborhood which we found to be very helpful.
We took a short stroll down the road and found several wonderful places to dine. We also greatly appreciated how close we were to downtown and all the fun Seattle has to offer.
I would absolutely try to stay here in the future, if possible."
890677,15911253,2014-07-18,15609034,Holly,We had a wonderful stay at Rob & Carols home. It's a very warm and inviting house and we felt right at home and very comfortable staying there. The owners were very quick to respond to any questions we had prior to arrival and any questions we didn't think of were answered very clearly in the house manual. The neighborhood is eclectic and incredibly convenient with tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance. We would not think twice about staying at Rob and Carols house again.  We had a wonderful trip and are already looking forward to heading back to Seattle!
890677,16055231,2014-07-21,4810415,Helene,"I would like to say that Rob and Carol's place was absolutely gorgeous. It is in a great location with many shops and restaurants close by. They responded quickly to our emails and when we arrived, had a very detailed manual describing all that we needed to know about the place. We had a great stay in this beautiful home, and would recommend it in a heartbeat. Thanks Rob and Carol! "
890677,16288654,2014-07-25,12406857,Chao,"Rob's home is very comfortable and warm, like ourselves home. The neighborhood is safety and easy to go everywhere. Rob is so kindness, he was always communicated quick and helpful. He also helped us finding the SUV to airport. Hope we have more of time to chat with each other. Thank you very much "
890677,16452039,2014-07-28,13061346,Dominick,"We arrived quite a bit early,  and Rob was there to greet us.  The place was ready for us, and it was great!  Awesome location near restaurants and bars.  The house was clean and neat,  and Rob had some beers for us in the fridge.  We would definitely stay again."
890677,16883199,2014-08-04,12766153,Jeff,"My family and I had the opportunity to stay in this amazing home in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle.  Rob and Carol were amazing hosts and their home was perfect for our needs.  I would definitely recommend this property if you are planning a trip to Seattle.  The amount of information they left for us to review was great, the location was perfect and this made our trip all the better.  This is a perfect spot to stay.  The neighborhood is quiet, the home is so well kept and the area offered so many options for dining, etc.

I have to say the rooftop deck was the best place for my wife and I to enjoy a glass of wine after a long day of walking and seeing the sites.  We enjoyed the close walk to several restaurants and a personal favorite of mine was getting a burger from Dick's Diner down Broadway.

I cannot say thank you enough to Rob and Carol for their hospitality and for making the process so painless.  I communicated with Rob throughout the process and everything was exactly as stated when we arrived.  My wife and our family will be looking to use Airbnb for our next vacation.  I can only hope our results are as positive as they were from Rob and Carol. "
890677,17550214,2014-08-14,10968315,Jennifer,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Rob and Carol's home. The home itself has a unique layout and is very clean and comfortable. It has a rooftop deck with amazing views. It also includes off street parking, which is a big bonus. When we arrived, we found a detailed booklet about how the house works, which was very helpful. The home is just around the corner from lots of great restaurants, and it's a quick drive to downtown. 

While we didn't get to meet our hosts in person, Rob was very helpful in making sure we had all our questions answered prior to our stay. I would highly recommend Rob and Carol's place to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
890677,17816192,2014-08-18,11874284,Paul,"Loved the house. The roof top terrace was a big plus. Bedrooms were spacious and beds were very comfortable. Incredibly well stocked kitchen for cooking. The living room was great for relaxing. The neighborhood was great, lots of restaurants and stores plus an impressive supermarket. Would definitely stay there again. "

Rob and Carol's home - and it is so clearly a cared-after HOME - was comfortable, warm, and close to absolutely everything. In short, it was perfect! Rob and Carol themselves were easy to approach, kind and very responsive. I really couldn't have asked for anything more!"
890677,26963791,2015-02-22,27898206,Winnie,"The pictures don't nearly do this place justice! A few friends and I were visiting Seattle and this place was a great ""home base"" for our adventures. There was an instruction manual on the table and a very thoughtful, hand-written note to welcome us to the space. The home is clearly well-cared for and very clean. One of my travel companions made the comment that the carpets upstairs were one of the comfiest she's ever walked on. We all had a great time and would definitely stay here again!"
890677,27418575,2015-03-03,28435731,Adam,"Had a great time, the place was classy, well-stocked, and the host was responsive and helpful. Didn't quite know what to do with five balconies but we weren't complaining."
890677,28301188,2015-03-22,9965581,Nicole,"A wonderful, clean, quiet place to stay in an awesome neighborhood in Seattle.  Everything we needed was in walking distance: tons of restaurant/eatery options, grocery stores, and public transit.  Rob and Carol left a helpful Home Manual.  They contacted us well ahead of our arrival to provide check-in procedures and parking information.  We enjoyed a sunny afternoon on the rooftop deck and appreciated the easy freeway access from the house on trips to explore the city with friends.  We would definitely stay here on our next trip back to Seattle."
890677,28703605,2015-03-29,1239381,Mia,"Rob and Carol's place was fabulous! It was clean, in an amazing location and had all the house amenities one could ask for. There were 3 of us adults who stayed in the home and we had ample room. They even left us with some basic breakfast foods and lots of spices/ condiments to do some cooking.

Rob and Carol were also very helpful and attentive with questions and recommendations for the area. I highly recommend anyone looking to stay in the Capital High area to stay at their home. I plan to be back one day!"
890677,29156523,2015-04-05,23828024,Peg,"We were in Seattle for my son's wedding which was absolutely fantastic and staying at Rob & Carol's was such a great experience,as well!   We appreciated the use of their stroller and portable crib for my little grandson. I'm not sure if they had anything to do with providing blue skies but the weather was great for the wedding!   Thanks!"
890677,29728771,2015-04-12,26122438,Blake,"Everything about our experience was exceptional. The stunning house and views, the location, and the people! Rob and Carol were amazing AirBnB hosts. We were greeted warmly by Carol and provided with fresh fruit! 
The house is located in a great neighborhood and the views are stunning from the 7 decks (I'm guessing on the exact number) including the rooftop deck. The kitchen cabinets were stocked, extra linens in the closets, shampoo, and many more extras were provided. Our company looks forward to visiting Rob and Carol's house again in the near future. "
890677,30551367,2015-04-24,27381958,Michele,"Rob & Carol's amazing home was the first AirBnb experience that my friend and I had, and honestly I could not have chosen a better place! The photo's don't do this space justice, the rooftop deck was an amazing bonus to a lovely, cozy home and a great location! We were able to walk all over Seattle and happily return to Rob and Carol's, which felt like we were coming home after long, exciting days checking out the city. A definite plus was that Rob and Carol took the time to write a little guide to all of their top picks of the city, which  after going down the list and visiting a lot of the places we couldn't agree more with. Do to their recomendations we always had a good meal! I would defienetly stay here again! 

Thank you Rob and Carol! :]

890677,31289689,2015-05-04,21942665,Gary,"Rob and Carol's house is beautiful and just a block away from restaurants, cafe's and a grocery store. The house was clean and well furnished and is a very interesting space. Our group really enjoyed our time there. It probably helped that the weather was beautiful as well.

When we had an issue with the locks, Rob and Carol responded right away to help us work it out and were very accommodating. Great hosts and great experience overall. We would love to stay here again."
890677,31768452,2015-05-10,27316832,Kathryn,The listing description was very accurate - this is a lovely home in a great location. Rob and Carol left a very helpful guide to the house which was well equipped and very comfortable. Cannot recommend too highly!
890677,33424992,2015-05-28,18622943,Marcin,"Rob okazaÅ siÄ bardzo pomocny, przy zakwaterowaniu bardzo dokÅadnie przekazaÅ wszystkie informacje o swojej nieruchomoÅci.

Dom jest bardzo praktyczny i przytulny, a taras na dachu z widokiem na downtown jest niesamowity! Okolica byÅa dla nas znana, jest to kulturalne centrum Seattle..."
890677,35496551,2015-06-19,34867067,Christopher,"Listing is accurate. Great home in a walkable area of Capitol Hill. Digitized lock makes check in a breeze (no worrying about carrying, losing, or returning a key). Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
890677,35842451,2015-06-22,22969639,Jingyue,"I am very satisfied with the stay. The apartment is clean and spacious. The living room is large enough for a family to enjoy. The master bedroom is large and has a queen-size (or even larger) bed; the secondary bedroom is not as nice, but has two single beds which are suitable for two children. 

As mentioned in the manuals, there sometimes is some tolerable noise at night. Some youngsters leaving the bars nearby talk loudly at night. I was woken up a couple of times at the first night. It's fine with me, but may bother some noise-sensitive folks. "
890677,36208083,2015-06-26,30109414,Greg,"This home is awesome and in a great location in Capitol Hill.  It's incredibly large (4 stories I think including the roof) with a nice kitchen, clean bathrooms with decent showers, and all the amenities necessary for a good trip.  Arrival and departure is super smooth with their keyed entry door.  Rob and Carol were great and very responsive.  I'd definitely recommend staying here and will likely stay again if it's available.  "
890677,36703788,2015-06-30,4622270,Kristin Lee,What a place! I was welcomed by a nice note and a lovely bar of chocolate. The house is even more extraordinary than I thought it was going to be. It had everything I needed. I was able to host a few friends for a lovely dinner on the rooftop deck. It was perfect. I can't wait to come back.
890677,37342042,2015-07-06,14808844,Mariel,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying at rob and carols. The house was beautiful and very clean and they provided everything we could need. The location was second to none, right by bars and restaurants as well as the grocery store. They were so friendly to communicate with and I would love love love to stay again. Thanks Rob and Carol!! "
890677,37992195,2015-07-12,25585709,Susan,"The location couldn't be better, and with it's own off-street parking it is convenient and easy.  Super clean and spacious.  R & C make arrival and departure flexible with a secure coded entry that changes with each guest.  A/C was a definite plus, as many properties in Seattle aren't, so that makes it comfortable when temperatures soar.  This property is a definitely value and we would recommend it to others."
890677,38508641,2015-07-16,24463239,Damon,"This was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had this far. Checking in was a breeze, their home is in a fabulous location and is absolutely beautiful. The rooftop deck has views of downtown and the Space Needle. I came in for a conference and was so happy I chose to stay here instead of a hotel. Could not recommend highly enough. "

890677,42316096,2015-08-12,442135,Jarrett,Great place! Has AC -- which many of the Airbnbs in Seattle don't.
890677,42646150,2015-08-15,22432219,Chris,"A beautiful and large cozy house, very well located near restaurants and shops. You can enjoy a drink on the roof terrace with s nice view on top of Seattle (and the space needle). "

890677,44445005,2015-08-26,33600478,Udit,The host made me feel very welcome. Everything was perfect. The location is great. We in fact enjoyed our 30 min walk to downtown. He also has parking space. There is plenty of room for four people to stay but you can fit about twelve. The house also has a nice terrace. 
890677,45114392,2015-08-31,1596373,Kelly,Loved staying at Rob and Carol's place. Location could not have been better. The pictures don't do it enough justice - stay here if you are visiting Seattle!
890677,48060082,2015-09-23,7755301,Alex,"Rob and Carol made every effort to welcome us to their unique and stylish home. The Capitol Hill area has a lovely feel to it, great shops and restaurants, and Rob and Carol's guide helped us sample the best of it. We can thoroughly recommend staying here if you get the chance."
890677,48861331,2015-09-29,4671566,Chad,"Rob & Carol's place was a great place to be for two nights, I only wish we could have stayed longer.  Beautiful, clean and very central location as described.  We LOVED the roof-top DECK!!!"
890677,50424795,2015-10-12,27740558,Kat,Our stay was amazing. Rob and Carols home was so much more then the pictures tell. This was our first airbnb experience it could not have been better. All the comforts of home and then some. Thank you so much for opening your home to others.
890677,51105537,2015-10-18,27004776,S,"Rob & Carol are great hosts.  They sent an email with detailed information about access to the house and parking options.  They also checked with us after we arrive to make sure things were going smoothly.  For a final touch they also mailed my phone and computer charger to my home as I had inadvertently forgotten them. 
I felt very safe and comfortable in their home and care.    "
890677,52749857,2015-11-01,279243,Keau,"Staying at Rob & Carol's place was a true 5-Star experience. Communication with them was amazing, checking in was so easy and the home was very comfortable. They left us goodies for breakfast and also had a dish of Halloween candies, in the event any Trick-or-Treaters came by the house. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Seattle. Thank you so much Rob & Carol!"
5793477,29876349,2015-04-13,1269025,Steve,"Niki was a superb host! She was very welcoming and knowledgeable and made me feel at home. Her apartment is really clean and tidy and has a few good features like a couch outside on a sunny balcony + couch with TV and stereo was great. Her bed is super comfy and she provides towels, sheets etc. The neighbourhood is nice enough too, very close to the bottom of town and not too far from Capitol Hill, bars and food places. I highly recommend staying with Niki! "
5793477,30408448,2015-04-21,19168076,Andrew,"Niki was a sweet and gracious hostess who made me feel at home instantly. As soon as I arrived, I was greeted with a German beer on the balcony in the nice weather. Her apartment was a 15 min walk from downtown which I enjoyed every day of my conference at the convention center. It was a very clean and neat apartment, and the balcony was key for hanging out in the evening. Great experience."
5793477,32395261,2015-05-17,18969894,John,"Very warm and welcoming flat. Welcomed and made to feel at home by Niki, the host. Flat was very close to centre of town and would definitely recommend staying here to both friends and family, as well as staying again should I visit Seattle again! "
5793477,33517818,2015-05-29,31775767,Albert,Nikki was a polite hostess that made sure I felt welcome. Her apartment is walking distance from the downtown areas in Seattle. I would recommend staying with Nikki to anyone!
5793477,33955570,2015-06-02,17950059,Christian,"Niki was the perfect host. She is very smart, funny and charming and takes care of you as a guest. I felt very welcome.

The flat is located super central with access to anywhere. I would for sure stay with her anytime again!"
5793477,34299982,2015-06-07,1842989,Karen,"Very nice place to stay, hostess Niki was very sweet and accommodating."
5793477,37243001,2015-07-05,35778511,Martin,I arrived late in the afternoon and she was there to greet me and show me around the place. The place was clean and well-kept. She was very nice and offered complimentary bottle water and shower amenities. Overall was a great experience and would recommend her to a friend!
5793477,37825023,2015-07-10,13112388,Jose,"Accurate listing description. Neighbourhood is relatively quiet, considering its downtown location. If you're walking, there is not much around in a two block radius, but driving or busing would take few minutes to get to central downtown. I was welcome by Niki's cousin, who was very nice and welcoming, even drove me to a nearby restaurant for pickup :) The place is ok clean (can be cleaner). I think its a bit highly priced, but i guess its because of location.  Overall a good experience, and would recommend / consider it again. "
5793477,38176398,2015-07-13,4582323,Jason,"Excellent and professional communication throughout my stay.  I had a late night flight and host was happy to accommodate. Apartment was clean, comfortable, and local convenient store/gas station 5min down the street.   15-20 minute walk downtown. 

Would recommend staying to anyone. "
5793477,38354754,2015-07-14,35623810,Prasanth,The accommodation is very comfortable and I had a relaxed stay. The host is very friendly and provided me all details n necessities
5793477,39088224,2015-07-20,5406659,Kimberly,"Niki was out of town during my trip but she communicated well before and during my stay. Her cousin was there to check me in and was around if I needed anything. The apartment was clean and the bedroom is large with a very comfortable bed. Within a 10 minute walk you can get to quite a few restaurants and shops as well as site like the Frye Museum. It's a convenient location to explore First Hill, downtown, and Capitol Hill, and with major bus lines within a few blocks you can easily get to all the Seattle neighborhoods (and to/from the airport)"
5793477,39224609,2015-07-21,18389263,Jason,Perfect for my short stay in Seattle and VERY close to everything downtown. 
5793477,39761235,2015-07-26,32955460,Stephen,"Apartment was lovely, clean and tidy with a nice balcony. She had adaptor plugs for different electronic devices which was ace. Its very well located and was very convenient for my requirements. Lovely area too."
5793477,41766430,2015-08-09,34699537,Kunzhi,"Nice Place, clean, quite and comfortable. My flight is 11:00 PM and Niki's cousin help me check in. The apt is close to bus station to downtown and Seattle center."
5793477,42531701,2015-08-14,35324394,Sergii,"Even though Niki was out of town at the time of my stay she made all arrangements for me to feel comfortable. Overall, I had a great experience. Nice location on the  Capitol hill. Easy to get everywhere by foot."
5793477,43251980,2015-08-18,15136173,Sunil,"This is a really nice place to stay in a great location: good, quiet neighborhood a walkable distance from Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill. To be clear (because the listing isn't entirely so): YOU ONLY RENT THE BEDROOM NOT THE WHOLE APARTMENT, even though you do have use of the rest of the apartment as long as no one else is using it. Two of my three nights, I had the whole place; one night, I came back to Niki's cousin and co-worker sleeping in the living room. I hadn't realized that was the arrangement (she had texted me in advance but I didn't get that's what she was telling me). Even though ultimately it was my misunderstanding of the listing, I appreciated that Niki and her cousin were apologetic and communicative (I had had trouble contacting Niki to get information beforehand, and her cousin served as a host proxy and was very friendly and accommodating).

Bottom line: really nice place to stay, and I was impressed and gratified by how Niki and her cousin handled a fraught situation."
5793477,44467437,2015-08-26,40997230,Dan,Niki's place was just as advertised and is really convenient getting to most of the city area within a 15-20 minute walk.  It was great having a nice grocery store around the block and I'd have no hesitation staying here again.  Thanks!
5793477,55228905,2015-11-29,36304854,Joshua,"Although Niki was away when I arrived, the check-in was easy.  Niki was very kind and accommodating.  The location is in perfect proximity to downtown and local transport links.  I recommend staying here to anyone."
5793477,56023490,2015-12-08,40981878,Ryo,"Fantastic location and host of the house.
Nobody need a hesitation to stay at there. It's acceptable to go to everywhere not only landmarks but others as well. Make sure I'll stay again when I go back to Seattle. "
958475,4790503,2013-05-26,6056891,Marcel,"When we arrived at the Annex, everything was arranged as it was listed on the website.  The entrance was locked with a keypad entry and automatic light for convenience and safety at night.   The first thing I noticed was how spacious the kitchen was, and fully stocked with an array of spices in addition to a collection of beautiful clean dishware and cooking equipment.  The kitchen was equipped with everything I needed to cook meals during my stay, as well as some additional perks (tasty little cookies that were provided by the owners, coffee, cooking oil). The bathroom was impeccably clean and had a neat little tub with floors that were always warm, basic toiletries, and clean soft towels available. The living room boasted a comfortable couch and a large window overlooking the sculptures in the backyard, in addition to the flatscreen TV with streaming Netflix, Pandora and Crackle movies. There was a nice gas fireplace which heated the room promptly when turned up.  The laundry room was shared with the owners in the nearby garage and was stocked with everything I needed. Since it was priced so competitively online I thought that when I arrived it would be a smaller place, but I it was spacious and comfortable, with large beds that were nicer than the one that I have at home. 
As hosts, Bruce and Shannon went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  The offered us a bicycle to ride as well as advice on local hangouts and grocery stores.   They were quick to offer their assistance at any time needed, and were even gracious enough to provide us with a sample of beer from a local craft brewery.  The last thing I will mention are the decorations within the apartment- Bruce and Shannon are obviously artists and as such have customized the annex with very unique dÃ©cor, from the bedrooms to the bathrooms, this place is covered with cool things to look at and explore.  I canât stress enough how happy I was to have found the place, it was definitely the best value in town. If you want to stay in a unique, comfortable apartment with a central location and generous owners who ensure the happiness of their guests, look no further and book a stay at the Studio Annex!
"
958475,4969193,2013-06-04,6296648,Curtis,"Our accommodations were clean and cozy! The decorations are unique in that they are a composite of ""retro country"" with a Texas flavor. The furnishings include a complete kitchen and all accessories, with a little extra in ""emergency"" food if needed. This apartment is truly a delightful place."
958475,5044485,2013-06-09,5657524,Shannon And Jeff,Bruce and Shannon's apartment was absolutely wonderful.  You can tell that a lot of love was put into it.  Every time I came in I noticed a unique detail that I hadn't before.  I loved it.  They also have an immense knowledge of the area and are active in the community.  They gave us so many pointers on places to go and things to do.  It was great.  We couldn't have asked for better hosts.
958475,5227953,2013-06-19,5391227,Jorge,"Bruce and Shannon were great hosts! We had an amazing time and a fabulous studio to stay in. The rooms and kitchen were a pretty good size, considering this is a studio. The beds were quite comfortable. Overall, the studio offered all the amenities from home. You will love it!!"
958475,5316213,2013-06-24,6377080,Martha,Studio Annex was absolutely wonderful! Fascinating and comfortable. Bruce and Shannon were very nice and helpful. We enjoyed our stay immensely.
958475,5454324,2013-07-01,5336282,Chris,"Thank you Bruce & Shannon for being such great hosts and you're place was the perfect place for our 1st experience here on Airbnb.  You're place was in a great location, private, unique in more ways than one and very accommodating.  It had everything we needed and it really felt like a home away from home.  We will definitely be back to stay at your place once we come back to Seattle and recommend it to anyone who is wanting to visit because it is just simply awesome!  We appreciated your offer to let us stay another night free of charge because of the emergency appendectomy surgery that my girlfriend's sister had to endure on her vacation!  Thankfully everything went well and we didn't have to cancel the rest of our trip.  We are thankful for your understanding and will remember your kindness.  Hope to see you again sometime in the future!

-Chris, Stacie and Carisa"
958475,5730487,2013-07-14,1759898,Aidan,"Staying at the Studio Annex was an amazing, relaxing, memorable experience.  I've put off writing a review because it is hard to say enough good things about the apartment and the hosts!  Every inch of the apartment is designed with creativity, and the word ""pristine"" doesn't adequately convey how perfectly and immaculately it is maintained.  Bruce and Shannon have thought of everything, as well -- including a mid-century cooler and picnic blanket, ground coffee in the larder, and a smattering of DVD's, in case one needs to cocoon one evening.  The beds were very comfortable, and I am a picky sleeper.  We stayed for 8 nights, and we loved taking our coffee at the outdoor table which offered enough privacy we could take our coffee in our pj's.  (And the bubbly water feature was very relaxing.)  The al fresco dining area was so pleasant we brought lunch home some days to enjoy the apartment further!  One morning was crisp and too cool to coffee outdoors, so we took our coffee inside, in front of the fire, which felt very luxurious.

The location can't be beat.  We walked to the International District for exploration and meals, the bus was nearby, and it was a very short drive to the airport.

I can't recommend the apartment or the hosts enough.  Bruce and Shannon are incredibly talented, creative, and generous people, and if I am ever returning to Seattle -- which I hope I will -- I plan on staying with them again."
958475,5909181,2013-07-22,6214744,Courtenay,"We had a wonderful time staying in The Annex!  Everything about it was comfortable, inviting and wonderfully decorated. Fantastic proximity to Capitol Hill. We would stay there again in a New York minute!"
958475,5986365,2013-07-25,6916374,Kari,Great home base for our adventures in Seattle. The suite was very clean and exactly like in the pictures (great decor).  Lots of little extras to make our stay comfortable.
958475,6088952,2013-07-29,1124739,Bessie,"This place was great! Bruce and Shannon were super quick to respond to all my many questions of where and what before our trip. While we didn't see much of them after our first meeting (and only then because we had arrived earlier than our appointed time while they were still cleaning and preparing the place), there were enough thoughtful details throughout the place that showed them to be very gracious hosts.

The coded access was convenient and everything we could need was provided - towels, toothpaste, soap, wifi and kitchen stuff. I love how they posted a detailed guide for the house and provided travel brochures for Seattle.

The place would definitely be big enough for a family of 4 or even 6 (the 2 of us were comfortable though). The location too was perfect. It was easy to find just off the freeway and fairly convenient by bus to get to town and where we wanted to go.

Last but not least, the artistic elements were a great introduction/welcome to the creative culture of Seattle.

All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend Bruce and Shannon's studio."
958475,6263198,2013-08-05,530537,Nicole,"Far Above and beyond what we were hoping for. Thank You, Bruce and Shannon, for an awesome stay! This place was absolutely perfect for the four of us (my husband and me, his brother and girlfriend). It was well kept with great decor and interior details. We cooked breakfasts and dinners in the kitchen which was stocked with spices. It was an easy walk from the light rail to the house with blackberry bushes in bloom along the way. Everything about this place was exactly what we wanted, and we are excited to stay here again when we make it back to Seattle! "
958475,6344833,2013-08-09,6997050,Shelly,"We LOVED staying at Bruce & Shannon's house during our stay in Seattle.  We (family of 2 adults & 2 kids) loved how cool & funky the space is; it seemed like we were constantly discovering something we hadn't seen before in the house. The house is PERFECT for a family, couple or even girl's get away. It was immaculately clean, kitchen was stocked well and there was even a bottle of Bruce's homebrew waiting for us in the fridge.  Bruce & Shannon are great hosts!"
958475,6487780,2013-08-14,597079,Diane,"Bruce and Shannon were fabulous hosts! The apartment was incredibly well appointed,clean and with such thoughtful detail to the traveler's every need. The beds were very comfy. Really, this was the perfect spot for our family to spend a terrific week on Seattle. "
958475,6934168,2013-08-31,3226522,Jill,"Wonderful! What a gem of design, comfort, cleanliness and quality. Amazing kitchen amenities-even spices. 5-star towels and bed linens. Bruce and Shannon's place is a trophy for the AirBnB concept. "
958475,7137970,2013-09-08,7597648,Steve,"Thank you Bruce and Shannon! Our stay at your place was all we expected and more and would certainly stay there again. Beds were as comfortable as your other guests stated previously. The close proximity to downtown was great. We enjoyed having all the comforts of home. Your creativity throught the place was admired by all of us! I will and would recommend your place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!
Thanks again for everything,
Steve, Denise and Brianna"
958475,7188318,2013-09-09,2520312,Sarah,The house is incredibly well-designed. you will love the place if you like vintage-style-house. It was the most stylish  house.. :) and they were quick and nice.
958475,7329216,2013-09-16,7636569,Luca,Bruce and Shannon's home is absolutely beautiful. Its photos don't do it justice. Its location was nice and close to downtown. We would definitely recommend this home to anybody visiting Seattle. 
958475,7560264,2013-09-24,8244632,Monica,"Everything I envisioned and more! An excellent collection of vintage furniture and decor, making for a unique home away from home experience. The heated tiles on the bathroom floor was a pleasant surprise as well. Very charming annex and neighborhood. Hopefully you get greeted by their adorable dogs as well! "
958475,7733882,2013-10-01,2849860,David,"From the moment I stepped into Studio Annex, I felt at ease, for both Bruce and Shannon were there to welcome me with warm smiles.

Bruce and Shannon have done a great job of creating a beautiful and comforting space that's filled with character. My friends and I all felt at home. So much in fact, that we stayed in and relaxed a little more than we should have. And I was super impressed that they had everything set up for easy recycling, and eco-friendly supplies. No other host has had any of that available before.

So in all, I would definitely stay again! Thank you Bruce and Shannon!"
958475,7923542,2013-10-08,2073657,Austin,Had an amazing time staying at this house! It was perfect for the four of us and hosts had everything all set for us. Will definitely be staying again when we go back up to Seattle. 
958475,8190175,2013-10-20,2128136,Jess,"What a cool place!  As soon as I walked in I really loved the feel of the Studio Annex.  Given that I'm from Texas I enjoyed the touches of home that was found through out the place.  It had all of the comforts of home as well.  Shannon and Bruce were always around to help with anything we needed or to answer questions we might have.  Although the international district isn't far I still found it very convenient to have a car, but I'm from a place where I'm used to having a vehicle.  It only look 5 to 10 minutes to get to downtown which was perfect and it was a great location to get in and out of Seattle to do some exploring around Washington State.  I will absolutely stay here again next time I'm coming to Seattle.  Thanks guys for a wonderful stay! "
958475,8351641,2013-10-27,8944692,Sandy,"The annex is a great place to stay in Seattle! My boyfriend and I stayed for a week and were very comfortable. Even though it's south of most things to do in Seattle, the distance is not far at all and the house is very easy to reach from the highway. Most parts of town are within a 10-15 minute drive.

Bruce and Shannon are very professional and have thought of most things a guest could ever need (including a first-aid kit and emergency toiletries in the bathroom). They're very hands-off hosts, and the annex has a separate entrance so you feel like you have a private space, and you are not intruding on the hosts' home. 

The heated floor in the bathroom is a nice touch, and the gas fireplace is also great to relax by after a busy day. "
958475,8839146,2013-11-20,8904903,Erin,"This place is amazing. The fireplace, full kitchen, and stocked bathroom and bedrooms were all so comfortable. Bruce and Shannon are great hosts, and have thoughtfully included emergency sewing kits, extra toiletries, and even some great reading material (books on Klimpt and Picasso!). Bruce was also very helpful with tuning up the bikes we took out, and pointing out some different sights to see around their place. It was also really easy to take the bus/light rail to and from the airport. This is an incredible place to stay in Seattle!! "
958475,8982156,2013-11-30,8503698,Colleen,"The rental was clean, comfortable and artsy. There were a lot of supplies stocked for personal care in case someone forgot toothpaste, toothbrush etc. There were plenty of blankets and comforters and some food items such as coffee and oatmeal. If I need a place to stay in Seattle in the future, I will definitely look to see if this place is open before checking elsewhere and would recommend to others."
958475,9112210,2013-12-08,8900938,Carlos,"Just to say that the decoration of the apartment it is even better than the pictures, home sweet home. You are really close to Seattle Downtown. Bruce was really helpfull. In the house you can find everything that you would need to feel like home, even bike to ride to Seattle. 
If I return to Seattle, I will stay there again.

"
958475,9763673,2014-01-08,3900738,Katie,My husband & I could not have been more impressed! This space is amazing!! We will definitely be back. This was our first airbnb experience. Our friends who live in Seattle were so impressed they wanted to check it out! There was more hospitality here than at most B&B's & we have been to a ton all over. I wish we could've stayed longer...Thanks so much Bruce & Shannon! 
958475,9853959,2014-01-14,9483934,Nikkol,"What a lovely experience! The pictures do not do the place justice. Anything and everything we could possibly need was at our disposal (and then some!). 

By mere fate/chance we had the pleasure of meeting Bruce and Shannon at their little Trailer Park market (its amazing, ask them about it!) and they are just as lovely and adorable as their home. If and when I ever get back to Seattle, this will definitely be my first choice! (Seriously, Bruce and Shannon - if you ever decide to rent, let me know!)"
958475,9961123,2014-01-21,10931135,Meganne,"The Studio Annex is a great place to stay! It's very clean, cozy, and the decor is awesome. Bruce & Shannon were accommodating to our schedule and were kind enough to leave the lights on for us on the evening of our (very late) arrival. The private keyless entry was also very convenient. Bonus for you runners/walkers/cyclists out there: There is a great running path mere steps from the front door! I took it all the way to the waterfront and enjoyed a jogging tour through the neighborhood. You will not be disappointed with the Studio Annex! "
958475,10001604,2014-01-24,2316057,Jen,"Wonderful value for this two-bedroom apartment in Central District. Hosts were welcoming and flexible, and were nice enough to text me to let me know about items I'd left behind. Fireplace and TV in the living room nice treats. Interesting aesthetic and care devoted to the set up."
958475,10179082,2014-02-04,5627593,Brianna,"my boyfriend and our two friends stayed in this awesome suite for the weekend. it was conveniently located in a quiet neighbourhood - only a ten dollar cab ride to downtown! the place itself is decorated immaculately. very americana, right up our alley. there was ample space for the four of us. everything which was necessary for a bed and breakfast was provided - all the toiletries, netflix, coffee, etc. we never met Bruce and Shannon, but with a keypad entry, check in and out was seamless. definitely would stay here again!"
958475,10345876,2014-02-15,989647,Aubrey,"Bruce was very friendly and quickly responded during my stay with questions about location. The apartment is central to bus and train lines, beautifully decorated, and very clean. "
958475,10426301,2014-02-18,11340053,Colton,"Bruce and Shannon were wonderful hosts. Not only did the house have all of the amenities, but the the hospitality was above and beyond. Our car got broken into on the street and Bruce and Shannon helped to clean the car of glass and bandage our broken window. Very nice people."
958475,10875859,2014-03-11,8473050,Jonathan,"I don't think we could have found a better place to stay in Seattle. Super quiet neighborhood located minutes from downtown, complete with excellent amenities and wonderfully creative decor. Our luggage was lost by the airline our first night, so the emergency cabinet stocked with toothbrush/paste and other necessities really came in handy. There's also a really cool paved bike/running trail just down from the place that leads to full views of the downtown Seattle area as well as various parks and playgrounds. We can't say enough good things about our experience at this artistic hideaway. Will definitely be the first place we look next time we plan a visit to Seattle."
958475,11218135,2014-03-25,11942784,John,"The Seattle Studio Annex was amazing. My roommate and I could not believe how cute and comfortable the set-up was. There is nothing to be critical of here. The price, hospitality, and aesthetic were all really above and beyond the expectations that we had. I only wish I had had more time in town to just relax here, but attending a conference made that difficult. At any rate, when we were able to be at the Annex, it was very relaxing. "
958475,11310355,2014-03-29,3026171,Luz,"This is an awesome spot in the heart of Seattle! Besides, Bruce and Shannon are great hosts. They really want to make of your stay an unforgettable experience!"
958475,11997371,2014-04-21,496196,Sarah,"This was a real find.  The two bedroom apartment was very comfortable, artistically decorated and every need had been anticipated. We enjoyed our stay, the space was private while our hosts were ready to accommodate us if we needed anything.  Having the availability of a washer and dryer was another plus. I give them the highest marks."
958475,12331481,2014-04-29,11933724,Kari,"What a cool apartment!  Bruce and Shannon have done a spectacular job decorating this 2 bedroom apartment with funky/cool/interesting 'antiques'.  We cooked a few meals while staying, and were pleasantly surprised to find the kitchen very well stocked with the essentials.  We used the bus (bus stop is a very short walk away) and light rail to downtown, which was fairly convenient.  Overall, this was a great place to stay!"
958475,12832241,2014-05-12,8052213,Brian,"Our group of 5 had a great experience staying with Bruce and Shannon. The space was exactly as advertised, and the location was very convenient. Will definitely stay with them again next time we are in Seattle!"
958475,13073408,2014-05-19,6408533,Evan,"a great and comfortable place to stay, in a nice residential neighborhood. the place was spacious and clean. not too far from things you want to see in the city. we had a rental car, though, so i can't say for sure how easy it is to travel via public tranpo or by foo. but this was a fabulous apartment, and i would definitely stay here again. "
958475,13280908,2014-05-24,12512842,Jiayang,Great house! Bruce is very nice and helpful. Great stay.
958475,14338800,2014-06-17,10535428,Melissa,"The Annex was beautiful, just like the pictures. The host was very accommodating, and very kind. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. I would love to stay here again."
958475,15034005,2014-07-01,11180709,Amy,"The apartment was very clean, safe and easy to find. Location is very convenient to get to the ball fields, downtown and space needle."
958475,15311110,2014-07-07,8277484,Mary,"The rental was exactly just like the photos. We loved how unique the place looked. We felt like every corner we turned there was something neat and different. The place is well stocked. They thought of everything from umbrellas, to toothbrushes, and even have several map guides/magazines. This place was close to everything - pretty much a 10 - 15 minutes drive to anywhere in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back again."
958475,15868999,2014-07-17,8097863,Samuel,"Bruce and Shannon are great. We only saw both once each, and they were both wonderful hosts. So in terms of feeling like we had our own space we definitely did. 

It's a clean, inviting space. Lots of towels! :) We were there during some hot days so it was warm in the unit our first couple of nights - even with windows open and fans running, but it wasn't unbearable. And the PNW doesn't get a lot of hot days like that anyway, so it's not a huge deal. 

I think for 5 it's a little squeeze - especially with one bathroom, but we managed well. I'm 5'10"" and the shower was barely tall enough for me, so if you're a much bigger person you'll be bending down to take a shower. 

The location is fairly convenient to the Convention Center where we were at - 10 minute drive. There was street parking for free, too. 

All in all, a solid stay, although probably most suited for less people. "
958475,16144012,2014-07-22,6530873,Pamela,"Bruce and Shannon were great hosts.  While I didn't meet them (too much to see and do in Seattle!), they checked in during the stay.  The place is clean and very comfortable.  If you rent a car for the weekend, street parking was no problem at all!  I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here."
958475,16539426,2014-07-29,12057547,Sherry,"The space was just as pictured!  What a lovely little spot  that had everything we needed.  We met Bruce and Shannon right when we arrived and they were so nice!  The house had plenty of towels, kitchen utensils and space for the three of us.  We were within minutes of the stadiums which was convenient since we had mariners tickets.  There was plenty of street parking available and a nice little path for walking/running right around the corner.  We would definitely stay again!  "
958475,16711228,2014-08-01,15542959,Elaine,My 3 friends and I had a great stay at Bruce and Shannon's place. My friend and I arrived early Monday morning and Bruce was accommodating when it came to storing our luggage. He provided us with information about what was around and directions to get there. The place was clean and well kept. Highly recommend staying here!  
958475,16974090,2014-08-05,1118156,Mark,"We had a great stay with Bruce and Shannon.  They were helpful, but everything was prepared so there really wasn't any need to bother them.  The apartment is as fun as it looks in the photos.  Very creative and very cozy."
958475,17262218,2014-08-10,13048070,Sarah,The annex was a great place to stay. It was very comfortable and Bruce and Shannon seemed to have thought of everything guests could want. The place is exactly as described. Getting around was easy. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. 
958475,17554967,2014-08-14,460762,Andrea,"Finding and checking in to the suite was seamless, the hosts were easy to contact and left a binder with lots of info. We almost had as much fun exploring the artwork and antiques in the apartment as we did the city! The rooms were spacious and we had everything we needed, pillows, blankets, towels and a well appointed kitchen, although all we used was the coffee maker :) The hosts even leave extra toiletries in the medicine cabinet, they obviously take pride in hosting people and think of lots of little details. The neighborhood is so quiet at night, sleeping was a breeze. I would highly recommend this suite for a stay in Seattle. One little note, when I looked at the property on a map I thought it was walking distance to downtown but when I saw it in person I realized the freeway is in between this neighborhood and downtown, so I would recommend cabs or buses to get downtown, it doesn't take long but it is something for travelers to consider. They also have bikes available to borrow (included in the rental) and Seattle seems like a very bike friendly city."
958475,18000814,2014-08-20,16141676,Vanessa,My daughter and I spent a week at The Annex. She arrived first and was greeted and checked in. The location is great. The neighborhood is quiet but there is a bus stop nearby and it was only five minutes to I5. Everything about the place is comfortable and welcoming. There was so much space compared to the hotel rooms we were considering. I would recommend it to anyone and would stay there again. 
958475,18400699,2014-08-26,8833545,Elizabeth,"We had a great stay at the Annex.  The neighbor hood was fine and the Annex is located within a 10 minute walk to public transportation. The studio is very cleverly decorated and well appointed. Our hosts were quite and unobtrusive, yet totally accommodating.  A fantastic deal."
958475,19129827,2014-09-07,18073353,Nicholas,"Beautiful place, accurate description and the hosts were welcoming and friendly. "
958475,19525660,2014-09-14,18485653,Joanne,"Everything was wonderful! It was my first airbnb experience and I was very pleased. Bruce and Shannon were available, helpful and great resources regarding the city. The apartment was perfect. The location was convenient too. It was so nice to stay in a home as opposed to a hotel! I would definitely recommend the Studio Annex to anyone travelling to Seattle!"
958475,20002223,2014-09-22,471648,Carmen,"The studio annex was the perfect place to stay while in Seattle! It was a short drive anywhere and fairly easy to find things in the area. 

I only met Shannon and Bruce very briefly but they were very accommodating and helpful! It was wonderful having so much privacy with the annex. 

We absolutely loved the quirkiness of the apartment! So much stuff to look at. This experience was 100% fantastic and we would recommend staying with Shannon and Bruce to absolutely anyone!"
958475,20603307,2014-10-02,3311814,Sophie,"This was a lovely place to stay. My friend and I stayed here for a week and really enjoyed having a full kitchen to cook dinner in and a cosy living room. It's a really unique space, beautifully decorated and furnished. The beds are enormous and comfortable, and the area is really peaceful at night. Both the bathroom and kitchen were stocked with little treats. The studio is about 15 minutes' walk from the Beacon Hill light rail station or 25 minutes from Chinatown. "
958475,20831226,2014-10-06,17021994,Christian,"What a wonderful place! Me and my friends decided to visit Seattle for my birthday this past weekend. We wanted to find a place relatively close to all the good spots like the Space Needle, Pikes Place and some night life. The photos of the place are exactly as described, but better in person! Every room had a personal touch, and me and my friends felt like we literally had anything we needed if we wanted to stay for a week or a month. It was also just down the street of a ton of restaurants and grocery stores. We were even provided detailed instructions for the accommodations, and definitely took advantage of the awesome bikes, which we took to a bridge overlooking Seattle and Safeco Field. There were also tons of pamphlets provided for additional things to explore in the city. I think my favorite part of this place was the touch of exploration everywhere in the house. The old school cameras on the fireplace were open to feel and touch, and the dresser in the room we stayed in had tons of drawers filled with random knick knacks that may have been left by other guests, or the hosts themselves. Each bed comfortable slept 2, and my friend who took the couch enjoyed being cozy by the fireplace.
The ceilings are a little low (I'm only 6'0 personally) and  everyone in my party would be able to touch the ceiling. It's not really a big deal, just something to note if your taller than me. 
Overall, we had an excellent stay here, and would definitely recommended anyone stay here if visiting the awesome city of Seattle. "
958475,21234591,2014-10-13,9076257,Melissa,"The host was very friendly and helpfull with everything we needed.
The place was great, clean, clean, clean and everything we needed. 
It was super fun and a very welcoming place to stay. Would totaly recomend staying here if you visit seattle. not for from downtown and uber cab is cheep anywere you need to go. "
958475,21473752,2014-10-18,3394308,Lynn,This was the perfect location for us since we were in Seattle to attend a training at the Pacific Medical Center Beacon Hill. We were a short walk to the training site. The Annex was comfortable and quirky.  There was always something to look at and play with!  The tile work was absolutely beautiful. Walking to the International District for great Asian food was a treat. 
958475,21701545,2014-10-22,11314697,Kathryn,"Whatever you are imagining about this place....it is even better!! My friend and I took a trip to Seattle during our fall break at law school. The set up could not have been any better. This is an amazing location and it has everything you could need and more! If given the opportunity to come back to Seattle, I will absolutely book my stay here again. 

I will leave you with this: fireplace + rain + fall = little piece of heaven! "
958475,22017783,2014-10-28,20101434,Ross,"We really enjoyed our time in Bruce & Shannon's studio flat. The flat was really beautifully and originally decorated with lots of wonderful antiques and junk - just our cup of tea. The beds were comfy, bathroom clean, kitchen had everything you could need and a lounge with a great entertainment system.
Bruce and Shannon were great hosts, sorting out any problems or queries - they even ordered us a taxi to the station when our phone didn't work.
Bernal Heights is a nice suburban area - very quiet. We didn't eat locally, mostly eating in the city before returning to our lair.
The only negative here is that it's a bit of a slog to get to transport to ferry you in and out of town. However, it's worth it to get this level of accommodation at this price in a city the size of Seattle.
We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Studio to anyone visiting Seattle."
958475,22360820,2014-11-04,68103,David,Listing was accurate and in a great (email hidden)s were very accomodating.
958475,22757562,2014-11-14,9057808,Thom,Perfect place for our trip. Easy access to town by foot or by train. A great house that was very kindly stocked before our visit. Comfy and warm - a welcome place to return to after a day in the cold weather. 
958475,23297322,2014-11-28,10675005,Steven,It was a great experience living here at Bruce&Shannon's annex. The location is really convenient and there is really good dim sum place in chinatown near where the annex locates. Bruce gave a good recommendation for morning jogging also. Loved the thanksgiving break experience in Seattle.
958475,24015834,2014-12-16,4906524,Abie,"Adorable apartment with fun decor, smooth booking process, great hosts. "
958475,24588927,2014-12-31,14581195,William,Cozy apartment close to downtown with great amenities. Hosts were very helpful and the beds were  comfortable. The decorating was very unique and we enjoyed our stay very much. We'll be back next time we visit our grand kids in Seattle ! 
958475,24965926,2015-01-04,647739,Nathan And Sara,"This place is amazing! One of the best we've ever stayed at. Great location. Hosts were super nice and very attentive. We would definitely love to stay here again, to be honest we really didn't want to leave."
958475,25355957,2015-01-13,24264452,Tom,"Everything was as described in the listing.  Very comfortable and convenient.  The Light Rail and nearby grocery store were closer than I expected.  Also, nice to be so close to the Bike trail. 

Tom & Adrienne"
958475,30184303,2015-04-19,14691594,Jessica,"I stayed at Bruce and Shannon's place for about 4 months with a awesome experience! The annex comes fully equipped with anything you could need during your stay and more. Bruce was an excellent host and although I didn't have the pleasure of meeting him, he was always very accessible via phone and responds promptly to any issues or questions you may have. He also had family living above me who were also very helpful. The annex is just 2 miles from downtown in a neighborhood called Beacon Hill. Even though Beacon Hill isn't one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle, I never felt unsafe or had any issues of crime during my stay. This was important to me being a single girl and living alone. The annex sleeps up to six comfortably and you have access to Netflix, Hulu, wifi, etc. The only minor issue I had was finding a place for all my clothes and shoes as neither room had a closet. An issue I wouldn't have had had I of not stayed so many months. I highly recommend this unique collective place!"
958475,31103566,2015-05-02,5835218,Katie,"
My wife and I had the pleasure to stay at 1514 17th Ave. S, an Airbnb located in  Seattle. We had never stayed in an Airbnb before but would not hesitate to do it again especially if this address were available.
Nestled in a hillside and just a healthy 20 minute walk through the park to downtown Seattle is where we found our comfortable and completely furnished two bedroom home.
Decorated by fans of the popular T.V. program, ""American Pickers"" this eclectic home will delight you, as it did us.
Comfortable beds, instant hot water and convenient washer and dryer, who could ask for more?
If this address is available, do yourself a favor. We were not disappointed and you won't be either.
 
"
958475,31586687,2015-05-07,7431288,Chris,Wonderful to spend time in Beacon Hill - light rail within walking distance of this beautiful residence. I was so comfortable there that I thought l was in a more fabulously decorated version of my own house. Loved having washer/dryer at our disposal- free soap no less. It's very quiet and clean and quirky. 
958475,32119558,2015-05-14,18138145,Mike,"Your place not only was a great experience but offered more convenient's than expected.  The accommodations were superb and more than adequate, the kitchen no only was fully furnished but we had coffee, tea and little extras also.  The art surrounding us at every turn was a wonderful addition to our stay.  We found the distance to the light rail, walking trail and park easy to walk, and we looked forward to our daily walk to the light rail.  We are in our 60's so we're concerned that we would be able to hang, but never had any issues.  The local grocery  store was a real bonus and we visited daily. When we return to Seattle we will wait until we can stay with you guys again, it was the perfect location that after day one we called home.  We easily made it from our home away from home to all the tourist places in Seattle, Fremont and Ballard using public transportation.  Thanks for opening your home and we look forward to visiting you in the future. Our prayer are with you and your family."
958475,32538993,2015-05-19,17153210,Malone,Great place - highly recommended.  Well stocked and unique in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Great access to stadiums and downtown on lite rail.
958475,33551593,2015-05-29,34145857,Betty,This was our first experience with airbnb and it was delightful.  The studio apartment was engaging with it's funky art and amazing tile work with the added treat of sculptures outside that made us smile.  The kitchen is adequately furnished and we were able to cook a great meal with food we bought at Pike's Market.  We found walking to the bus at the Freeway/Ranier station a really easy way to get in and out of central Seattle.  We would definitely ask to stay here again if we were to return to the area.
958475,34067611,2015-06-04,31681977,Lauren,"Bruce and Shannon, along with their sister and her wife, were gracious hosts that provided me with everything I needed! The space was clean, well-organized, and very cozy! I would definitely book here again!"
958475,34287457,2015-06-07,29991877,Justin,"Great spot!. Loved the decorations and how quite the area was. Annex had everything you need for a short or long term stay. Bruce and Shannon made the experience very easy. If your planning a trip to Seattle, this is a top choice over a boring Hotel."
958475,35201899,2015-06-16,1982783,Miguel And Jennifer,"The flat was so charming.  A lot of care and attention went into the decor. Bruce ' s sister even told me that the tiles were designed by Bruce and Shannon.  The beds were very comfortable,  and the flat was very cozy. Bruce was available when we called with questions. It is conveniently located near downtown,  and is very close to the metro. We absolutely loved staying here,  and would without a doubt, stay here again.  Do yourself a favor and stay here!"
958475,35459772,2015-06-19,6683989,Meredith,"We had a wonderful stay here! The space was comfortable and looked just like the pictures. It was also in a great location, not far from the Link train. "
958475,35779184,2015-06-22,1757286,Denise,We are so glad we had the pleasure of staying here. Brimming with collectibles and artistic charm this apartment is meticulously clean and perfectly well appointed with thoughtful might needs. We found check in easy and support easily accessible. We were close (by cab) to everything on our list throughout the city. It really felt like home. Would be a treat to stay here again. 
958475,36366319,2015-06-28,28710648,Scott,"The apt was very cozy and welcoming. Very close to the both stadiums, Pioneere Square and Pikes Market. Even though we didn't spend much time here because we to busy site seeing, we did make great use of the living room after a day hiking in Mt. Reiner. All the cool vintage decor was a nice touch too. Nothing like sleeping in the bed of a Chevy. "
958475,37284223,2015-07-06,27327576,Jo Ann,"Our place was perfect for what we wanted...2 bedrooms, kitchen, and living room. We even had a place to do our laundry. Did not know what to expect because this was our 1st airbnb and they spoiled us. Hosts welcomed us then left us along unless we needed something. LOVED their art work took pictures and would have loved to have talked more about their creations. My daughter and I are the creative type so these extra things like art books and refurbished furniture was just want we liked. Even though it was hot for Seattle the basement apt. was comfortable with plenty of fans and you could not here anyone upstairs. Thank-you for the nice space Bruce and Shannon."
958475,37838688,2015-07-11,30040907,Cody,"We stayed for about a week and loved it. We made use of the fans at night in the July heat, loved the water pressure in the shower, and most of all, that we were able to make healthy breakfasts and other meals in the well appointed kitchen. Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience a good one! "
958475,39172410,2015-07-21,34349417,Kirsten,The place was perfect! It was super clean and close to easy transportation to the city. Would totally recommend staying here.
958475,39525050,2015-07-24,30388755,Hanna,"We had a pleasant stay. It was roomy yet cozy. It was close to everything we wanted to do, and the host (Carri) was very helpful in giving us suggestions for restaurants. If there was anything of concern, I would say there may be some allergens, perhaps cat hair? Both my son and husband had allergic reactions and took Benadryl, which helped. "
958475,39910058,2015-07-27,7532228,Karim,"This place was great - super funky, clean, and a great location. It had everything we needed. Would stay here again!"
958475,41189417,2015-08-05,28002821,Kathleen,"Wonderful place! We arrived fairly late on check in day and were delighted to find lights on to welcome us. One of the first things we noticed was the coffee and other starter items which took some pressure off of figuring it all out first thing in the morning. The whole place was very generously stocked with countless amenities, more than we expected or even needed but appreciated since it went a long way in letting us know that Bruce and Shannon genuinely wished us a comfortable stay. We are a family of 5 and found there to be plenty of clean and fresh smelling towels, linens and pillows. There wasn't a thing that we would have wanted that we didn't find. We had limited but very friendly and informative contact with one of the care takers of the property who lives upstairs. Multiple contact numbers were provided so if anything was needed I'm sure a prompt reply would have come from somewhere. 
Loved the detailed binder including local sites, restaurants and directions to each recommended place. The walk to the link station was uphill and a little further than we had anticipated but it ended up working out great since it gave us exercise and an ideal opportunity to check out the neighborhood, architecture (new and old!) and the many wonderful wild blackberry bushes.
We found the annex to be very comfortable inside and out. There was a small covered outdoor table which was nice to enjoy a cup of coffee or a cocktail.
We definitely recommend Bruce and Shannon's Annex to other visitors to Seattle!"
958475,42110601,2015-08-11,28167602,Geri,"The house was very conveniently located. The decorations were awesome...lots of artwork and vintage items. The only complaint is that the bed in the back bedroom was very noisy. I think this is because it was a platform bed and the platform was wood planks. At any rate, we would stay there again! Loved it!"
958475,44403442,2015-08-26,26201510,Lora,"If you want privacy and a central location this apartment is for you.  We did without a car for 2 weeks in Seattle taking light rail and buses everywhere. The apartment is about 1/2 mile from the Beacon Hill Station, an uphill walk but good exercise.  Bus schedules can be found in the apartment. The apartment is nicely decorated in what I call industrial eclectic and outside are tiny garden areas filled with playful sculptures. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen has everything you will need, even if you cook full meals.  A washer and dryer are located in a separate building only a few steps away.  We did not see a lot of our hosts but when we did they were friendly and inquired if we needed anything.  The only downside to the location is its proximity to a major highway (noisy outside).  Inside you don't hear anything.  And the proximity may be a plus if driving. Also the neighborhood might be described as transitional with a mix of nice condos and some rundown smaller homes, many undergoing rehab.  We did not feel unsafe  but some may not like the urban seediness of the area.  For us it was perfect."
958475,46114093,2015-09-08,29136998,Lex,"Great accommodation! We loved the way it was styled-it has heaps of character & is very homely. It was very clean & tidy & had everything we needed & more, including beautiful towels, linen & bathroom products, full kitchen & cooking facilities, tea & coffee, great entertainment system & hairdryer.
There was a listing of nearby places to eat & buy groceries which was handy as we didn't know the area. 
Our hosts were there when we had questions, and were helpful and very friendly. 
It's about a 15 minute walk to the train station & grocer, and a pleasant 25 min walk to the edge of the city. The ceilings are low and the shower is raised so the shower could be a bit awkward for anyone over 6 feet tall but there's also a bath. 
The Oak hotel/tavern nearby was a good spot for dinner.
I'd highly recommend this accommodation! "
958475,48860965,2015-09-29,4214374,Louise,"I booked accommodation at Bruce and Shannon's place for my parents who are currently traveling and don't have access to internet so I will review the stay based on what they told me on the phone.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quirky, clean and interesting. They loved their stay in Seattle and having an apartment to relax in, in the evening made it feel very homely.
They said that the girls who rent the upstairs apartment were very friendly. Sorry I can't elaborate more. Regards Louise"
958475,50075159,2015-10-09,40843854,Hannah,"This Annex is absolutely adorable! I'd totally recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle who want to stay somewhere with some character. It is so cosy and full of lovely little surprise decorative items all over. Underfloor heating in the bathroom was a real treat! We found the place to be very well equipped with a lot more than we needed, even some chilled bottles of water in the fridge, and the whole place was really clean, tidy and thoughtfully prepared. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and access to public transport was really great for getting around the city. We were welcomed by the two ladies who live upstairs and had no hesitation about asking them if we needed anything, only all our needs were already exceeded, so we left them in peace. Thank you so much Bruce and Shannon for making our first airbnb experience so great :)"
958475,53125985,2015-11-05,426368,Tam,"We loved our stay in this unit. It was clean, comfortable, and very thoughtfully set up, top to bottom, from the delicious coffee, bath products and loaner umbrellas provided to the cozy fireplace. The hosts were great at communicating and making us feel at home."
958475,53486167,2015-11-09,16585001,Kiersten,"This was the perfect Airbnb for us! Parking in front was easy, they sent a key code for the door so we didn't need to coordinate a check in, the apartment is BEAUTIFUL and they had lots of nice amenities (snacks, roku, toiletries, etc). The apartment has a cozy, unique style and is perfect for a weekend getaway or longer stay. The neighborhood is quiet but only a $8-10 Lyft ride to the downtown area."
958475,53757688,2015-11-12,45452241,Julia,"Once we were accepted by Bruce and Shannon, they were quick to let us know the next step in the process. We were new to the whole system. Bruce answered all my questions, quickly and throughly.
  It was the prefect place to come home to every evening. The kitchen was well supplied with dishes, cookware and essentials at were needed to cook a meal. Which we did with items fresh from the Seattle Market. 
The beds were very comfortable. Bedrooms were interesting and fun. 
Our favorite item was the bathtub. Coming in every evening and slipping into the tub was a wonderful way to end the day. 
We were very pleased to see the neighborhood of the B and B. I grew up in the north end of Seattle and love the area. I was a little reluctant to stay in the south end, BUT once I saw the neighborhood and the area around the house, I was very comfortable and pleased. It is a quiet neighborhood with wonderful little houses. There is a park not to far from the house that has a breath taking view of downtown Seattle. Well worth the walk to see during the day and in the evening. 
Over all I would stay there again. It would be a great place to bring the family to, as there is room for 6 in the house.

958475,55560004,2015-12-02,25846174,Elaine,"Everything we needed plus more was readily available in the apartment.  Many compliments for the thoughtfulness and comfort, we felt right at home."
958475,56303126,2015-12-12,46316424,Jocelyn,Bruce and Shannon's place was super cute and spacious. It was cozy with the fireplace and interesting artwork around the house. It was nice to have everything I needed to cook a couple meals while I was there.
958475,57133653,2015-12-22,33855905,Dinuvia,"I had high expectations after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures and was a little afraid that they would not be met, but I was wrong. This place was absolutely adorable and the decor really inspired me to bring a little of their creativity home with me. The house was located in a great neighborhood. We had two wonderful meals just a short drive/walk away, one at Pippy's Cafe, a Korean fusion restaurant, totally delicious and different that your typical breakfast/brunch and another at Cafe Bengodi where we sat at a ""community table"" and met and chatted with two locals. 
Our main purpose for our visit was to go to a Seahawks game and this place was conveniently located close to the light rail stop. It was the perfect home in the perfect location for us. "
958475,57633050,2015-12-28,17519210,JungHwa,It was good experience at Shannon's house. Bery close to downtown and independent space.
8524349,48963890,2015-09-29,670729,Michael,The place was great and Jeremy and Rachael did an amazing job at responding to messages very promptly! Also great location! 
8524349,49842552,2015-10-06,7799813,Sheila,"The studio is really great, much bigger than you can tell from the photos, with very comfy (king) bed & couch and really nice shower.  I was surprised at how much I liked the mural - the whole place feels very metropolitan.  Everything worked great, albeit they are waiting for special-order blinds to arrive, which will make a welcome addition :).  I generally don't cook while on vacation so the micro-kitchen was just right, there were little labels for light, heat, etc. that were helpful, and the building was very secure and quiet.

Jeremy was incredibly hospitable and responsive, above and beyond, I will definitely try to stay here next time I'm in town."
8524349,51216900,2015-10-18,44752391,Lathan,"Staying at Jeremy and Racheal's place for our honeymoon was awsome. Jeremy met us on arrival and was so friendly and welcoming. The studio is much better then the pictures described. Very spacious, awesome, fun art work and beautiful natural light with freshly installed curtains for privacy at night. It is right on 15th but from inside we couldn't hear anything. We enjoyed the sonos speaker and had a very relaxing day of music, wine, and local cheese from pike market. There were snacks, coffee and drinks already inside, which is awsome after a long flight. At night you will fall in love with this bed, and Omy comforters, we never wanted to leave them. So fluffy and warm. The best part is the bus stops are right across the way, so no need for a car, we just jumped on the Dline for a quick 20min ride to pike. The public transportation is so clean and enjoyable, just kick back and take in the scenery. No need for missing all the beauty of seattle because your watching your gps. Perfect location to avoid the hustle and noises of the city at night with easy access to the downtown life and all major attractions at any other time. We used uber a few times when we were exhausted but never spent over $10 on a ride. Whether we were going to the space needle, fremont troll, pioneer square or pike market everything was within reach, just a quick bus ride. Make sure to grab a free bus transfer pass good for a few hours for on off privilege. We will definitely stay at one of jeremy and Racheal's properties for our next visit. Side note, our family and friends loved coming over to play shuffleboard. "
8524349,52909067,2015-11-02,40045,Kim,"My husband and I just returned from 5 nights at the Ballard Studio and found it to be a great base for our Seattle vacation.  I appreciated the convenience of the keyless entry, parking was easy, the studio had everything we needed and more (wish we had more time for the wine and snacks!) and Jeremy could not have been more accommodating.  We had a little trouble with Chromecast and a brand new TV was installed almost immediately.  These are hosts who really care about your experience in their rental.  We love Seattle and will definitely check with Jeremy and Rachael first when we visit again. "

We spent a week visting our daughter who lives in a small apartment just around the corner, and it was so nice to be able to invite her and her family to dinner etc. We really hope to stay here agian next time we come to Seattle."
5919096,33819769,2015-06-01,32218520,Kelly,"What a PERFECT little spot! Ballard is such a charming pard of Seattle, and this home is everything you hope it would be- absolutely adorable, very walkable, and reasonably priced! We LOVED staying here, and will stay again in the future!"
2385623,10507512,2014-02-22,9899195,Tommy,"Bojana was a great host, She has a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood that was very convenient to downtown.  Large comfortable bed and full bathroom, and she worked with me on a late check-in.  Readily recommend to others."
2385623,10582397,2014-02-25,9899195,Tommy,Great place left previous review this is placeholder.
2385623,10627117,2014-02-28,7678373,Neha,"I had a very comfortable stay at Bojana's. The house is lovely and cosy, and very peaceful. The walk to the 49 bus stop is not long - around 8-10 minutes. Overall, convenient and pleasant, and very relaxing."
2385623,12228911,2014-04-26,286545,Yuriy,"We had such a good stay with Bojana. The room was well decorated, the bed was very comfortable and the home was beautiful. We were out and about most of the day but really enjoyed coming back and relaxing here. We would love to stay here again in the future. Highly recommended."
2385623,13161390,2014-05-20,4107195,Hans,"Beautiful family, gorgeous home, and a great location. Too boot, Bruce Lee is buried just a couple of blocks away. And the bed is extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place and Bojana's hospitality to others. "
2385623,13317355,2014-05-25,2068777,Paul,"Bojana and her family were great to stay with. We barely saw them as we stayed mid-week until the weekend. They're out of the house from 7:30-5:30 and in bed before we'd be home. Her home is beautiful, clean and spacious. The rooms are perfectly kept; bright when you want them to be, dark when you want, too. "
2385623,13389922,2014-05-26,15743211,Kayla,"Bojana was a lovely host. My Mom & I arrived and were warmly welcomed by Bojana and her husband.The room was extremely comfortable, cozy, and clean. Towels were laid out neatly for our use, and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with a nice range of pillows. The house is located in a gorgeous neighborhood with lots of greenery and sturdy houses. Only a 10$ cab from the city. Despite other travelers staying with Bojana in another room, we never had any issues with running out of hot water in the shower. Bojana shared her tea with me, which made my 1st evening in Seattle nice and homey and cozy. 
I would strongly recommend her home to anyone who is looking for a kind, cozy, clean, simple stay.   
Thankyou! "
2385623,14213064,2014-06-14,16513888,Blake,"Bojana was a wonderful host. 
This was our first experience with AirBnB and our first time booking a shared space. We could find no other booking options in Seattle and even though it wasn't convenient timing for Bojana to have us there she found a way to make it work. 
The home is lovely and in a quiet neighborhood just a few blocks from 2 bus lines, and about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown and the Pike market.
There also appears to be on-street parking available if you are driving.  Check in and check out were a breeze. The bed was extremely comfortable with wonderful linens.  Bojana was up front with us about the noise in the morning from 630 to 730, and this was accurate. It worked okay for us, but if you are a light sleeper and you need to sleep longer this may not work for you.
There is also a shared bathroom. Luckily there were no timing conflicts, but this could be an issue for you if you are in a hurry. 
Overall we had a great stay and would stay with Bojana again in the future.
Thanks!"
2385623,14542569,2014-06-21,8519558,Itai,"It was a very nice and comfortable stay. I came only for a 2 nighta for some confernce and was hardly in the house. But it was very comfortable, and a very nice room and (website hidden) house is very  close to the nice view on lake union and the university. thanks!"
2385623,15080485,2014-07-01,17083705,Galia,"The room in Bojana's home was very comfortable, well decorated, and so well-lit! The house itself is a reasonable walk from the Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Volunteer Park. There is also free parking on the street, and from the house, most other sites are a quick drive or bus ride away! I had a wonderful time in Seattle, and am so appreciative of Bojana's hospitality!"
2385623,15216591,2014-07-05,3649801,Rachelle,Great Capital Hill home and neighborhood.  Wonderful hosts and great kids.  Enjoyed the room and the front porch for my evening tea.  
2385623,15343403,2014-07-07,16538009,Sophia,We had a wonderful stay at Bojana's! Everything was spotless and the room was sweet and spacious! The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. It was amazing! The house was a beautiful Seattle craftsman style home that was a close drive into the city. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
2385623,16155510,2014-07-22,17345223,Sarah,"My husband and I arrived very late at the home of our lovely hosts, but Bojana and her husband left a light on for us. The next day we met them and their gorgeous family and felt like we were meeting an extension of our own. We could not have felt more at home."
2385623,16183760,2014-07-22,365226,Rose & Mark,We definitely enjoyed staying with Bojana and her family. The whole family was very sweet and the morning kid noise was minimal. The house is gorgeous and our room was exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was great for strolling but dining options are a longer walk or short car trip.
2385623,17590148,2014-08-14,16943885,Gillet,"Bojana place is a nice and comfortable house located in a quiet and safe area. You will need a car to go there and to discover Seattle and it's area. 
 Bojana was really welcoming, nice and made us feel comfortable. 
 Even if it was for only one night, it was a nice experience.
I recommend this place."
2385623,17661405,2014-08-15,7903736,Tracy,"The home is gorgeous and spotlessly clean, and the room was luxuriously comfortable. So worth venturing away from downtown, and so much better than staying at a generic hotel!! Bojana's home is tucked away in a stunning neighbourhood, surrounded by exceptionally well maintained heritage homes. And, being on a bit of a hill, a couple minute stroll in almost any direction and one finds magnificent views of the city! I so enjoyed my short stay at Bojana's home. My only regret is that I didn't have time to stay in Seattle longer to better enjoy it! I would absolutely come back if I ever need to stay overnight in Seattle again! 

Also, because I was only in Seattle for a day this trip and was quite busy, I regrettably didn't meet the entire family and only met Bojana's husband, who was very nice. We had a great little chat when I arrived for check in. Hopefully I'll meet the whole happy family next time!  

I should mention that Bojana's home is located only 5 minutes walk from one of Seattle's most fantastic neighbourhood cafes -- Volunteer Park Cafe. I discovered it the first day, walking from a beautiful nearby park --  Interlaken Park -- to Bojana's. I went back for breakfast the next morning and enjoyed an excellent cappuccino and some divinely delicious Banana Brioche French Toast. When I met with a friend (a born and bred Seattle-ite) for lunch downtown later, he informed me that it is his favourite cafe in all of Seattle! Apparently, it is Seattle's best kept secret, tucked away in Capitol Hill, just minutes from Bojana's! Besides the great neighbourhood, I think that this little cafe is a great reason to stay at Bojana's!"
2385623,17986715,2014-08-19,3741972,Kelly,Lovely home! Had a great stay.
2385623,18043388,2014-08-20,20120450,Shawna,Everything was wonderful!  This was our first time with airbnb.  We are hooked.  We will be staying again for sure!
2385623,18144999,2014-08-22,5083776,Francesca,"Lovely, well-equipped and decorated, clean house in a quiet street and beautiful neighbourhood, with several eateries and cafes within walking distance. Bojana was a welcoming host who was quick to respond and offer any help or suggestions. Everything was very comfortable and me and my husband felt right at home! "
2385623,18435034,2014-08-26,18694809,Kelly,"I got in late on a Thursday night, and Bojana made sure to leave a key out and the light on for me so I felt right at home. She had clean towels waiting on the bed, and the house was precious. Excellent neighborhood. My mom and I walked to bus stops during the day and took Lyft at night. Maximum drive time to get downtown was about 10 minutes. Volunteer Park and Cafe was the cutest coffee shop and adjacent park within walking distance. Loved being in Capitol Hill and getting to relax outside of the city. Great trip. Great host. Would highly recommend this. "
2385623,19379837,2014-09-11,3227098,Aneta,"Bojana and Andrew were very welcoming and accommodating, we were able to arrive quite late at night.  The room was immaculately clean and located in a beautiful neighbourhood close to volunteer park.  We had no trouble arriving via public transit.  I would definitely stay again. "
2385623,19448345,2014-09-12,1025863,Philippa,Lovely home in a wonderful neighbourhood with a great hostess! Thanks for the restaurant advice where we had the best meal of our whole trip! 
2385623,19504948,2014-09-13,21183503,Ilze,"Bojana quickly responded to all of my texts and adjusted to our unpredictable and awkward schedule.  The room was just as described, quite comfortabl and the home was immaculate.  "
3303857,14654958,2014-06-23,3996403,Julien,"Nice flat: clean, calm, spacious and comfortable.
A little far from downtown but located in a quiet place with many buses stops, restaurants and shops. Notice that there is no TV in the flat (but it was not a problem for us).
WIFI was slow during the first day, but Melissa fixed it quickly.  
She made checking in and out very easy."
3303857,14881191,2014-06-28,2559713,Ben,"Melissa is great and very communicative. The place was exactly as advertised - excellent location, fast wifi, clean and just great for a short-term stay. "
3303857,15067794,2014-07-01,12779426,Arnold,"House was very clean, location is very convenient in the university district. Shops and food one or two blocks near by! Recommend this unit for holiday, visits, and weekend trips! "
3303857,15417432,2014-07-08,3382892,Nikki-Rae,"We loved our stay at Melissa's place.  For the price, this place cannot be beat.  The property was just as described in the listing.  Right in the midst of the University of Washington neighborhood, this property was very walkable to food, bars, a couple markets, and more.  I highly recommend Portage Bay Cafe for brunch just a few blocks away.  

It was also very commutable by bus to other parts of Seattle.  To Pike Place Market, the bus ride was not more than maybe 15 minutes.  Overall, the location was very convenient to get around and felt safe.  

As a host, Melissa was wonderful.  She was always quick to respond throughout the whole process.  Check-in was easy.  She even was so kind to accommodate our friend and allow 3-guest booking even though it was originally listed for 2 people.  Our friend slept on the couch, which was comfortable.  Melissa even brought over extra blankets, pillows, and towels for our friend.  

The place itself is cute and snug, and provided all the basics.  We didn't cook, but would have had what we needed if we wanted to.  There are plenty of windows to let in the summer sunshine, but can block out lots of the street noise if closed.  Also, the bed is really comfortable!!  If you are in Seattle looking for an affordable place to stay, Melissa's place will give you what you need.  "
3303857,15592441,2014-07-12,16287598,Ilka,Melissa was very nice and responded to our needs immediately.  It was my first time using airnb so I really didn't know what to expect.  We really appreciated that the place was clean.  Very quiet neighborhood.  Easy access to buses and the university.
3303857,15705736,2014-07-14,3114548,Luana,"Staying at Melissa's was easy, convenient, and comfortable. We arrived later than expected, which was not a problem, as Melissa left the apartment available to access at our convenience. The apartment was a great jumping off point for our weekend in Seattle. "
3303857,16257576,2014-07-24,7662846,Akshat,"The host was phenomenal and the room was as promised. Clean, comfy and good Internet. 
Accessible to every place and very safe area. Absolutely recommended."
3303857,16381646,2014-07-26,18494539,Guy,"Melissa was great, hands-off but attentive.  Very accomodating, given the short notice booking. The place was clean and did just the trick for us spending a couple of days in the city.

Would highly recommend."
3303857,16441787,2014-07-27,13264386,David,Melissa communicates well and was kind to let me stay one night.  The apartment is older but is very convenient to UW and has what you need. 
3303857,16843339,2014-08-03,2819272,Dan,The place was as expected and everything was easy. The floors were a little sticky but everything else was fine.
3303857,17290373,2014-08-10,17735733,Lyssa,"Melissa was very nice when she came by during our visit. Since this is a self-contained unit, there was really no occasion to get to know each other. The condo was clean, and sparsely furnished. The street noise is SIGNIFICANT, so do not stay here if you are a light sleeper. It is at a major intersection. Delivery trucks, buses, and drunken college students go by throughout the night."
3303857,17471307,2014-08-12,18941630,Umang,"The apartment was as promised - clean and at a very convenient location. 
There was a bus stop right around the corner to get to different parts of the city."
3303857,17649151,2014-08-15,19407742,Melinda,"Melissa was very accommodating and responded quickly to every request.
The apartment was as promised -- clean, comfortable, and conveniently located."
3303857,17957020,2014-08-19,18061046,Jessica,"Apartment was as listed. It was warm for our taste but glad a fan was provided. Bed was comfy. We could not leave windows open through the night because of the noise from the street down below. The curtains were great to keep the street lights out. We happened to run into Melissa one eve while she was there and she made sure things were ok, and checked in with us the night before we checked out. Overall a nice place to stay very convienent to everything. Only reccomendation is to make sure you purchase the parking space when you book. We got lucky when we arrived but the street parking there is horrible, we added a paid space after arrival."
3303857,18270307,2014-08-24,19245554,Pierre,"I don't know if these other reviews were written by host ""Melissa's"" friends but they're inaccurate. Please trust me and DO NOT STAY HERE. 

Upon booking my stay there was minimal communication between me and Melissa. I got the overall impression that she didn't really care. I asked her where I could find the keys and she said ""should be on table or kitchen counter"". Lot's of one liners. She did not give me details about the area I would be staying in and she didn't provide much help or ask me if I had been to Seattle before (which I hadn't).

I was very surprised when my Uber driver dropped me off at the apartment complex. It was very run down and ugly. There was dirt and debris in the corners of the complex, the floor had cracks and there was a big industrial sized trash can with rust stains right at the entrance of the complex towards the back wall.

I walked into the apartment and it was subpar. The pictures make it look much nicer than it is. Upon inspection I noticed that the blinds were a bit crooked and the window had water stains. There was a big dent in the floor right before the kitchen entrance (you sink down when you step on it). The soap in the sink was almost empty and the sponge was old and used. The windows were dirty, the toilet moves. So if you're sitting on the toilet and try to shift your weight the entire thing moves... Also, the bathtub had soap scum stains which she blamed on a botched paint job???

The bedroom was actually nicer than the rest of the place but it is very tiny. You feel boxed in.

Melissa did allow me and my guest to check in early at around 9:30 AM which was nice and she did offer to wave the $30 per extra guest fee. She did call me on the last day and ask me how my stay was and I clearly stated that it was a lot worse than I expected.

Overall I felt tricked by the pictures and the place just looks seedy. Sorry Melissa but this is true and you have to clean the place up because it's not fair to other guests.

3303857,18886066,2014-09-02,8928334,Maartje,"I had a good stay in this apartment (9 nights for work and holiday). It is conveniently located for the university, has nice neighborhoods such as Fremont and Ballard close by, and many shops at walking distance (I really liked the Traders Joe nearby). The apartment was clean when I arrived and it had everything you need for a short stay (nice living area, bedding, towels, kitchen supplies, stable WiFi connection). Some downsides were limited light in the living room due to the tree in front of the window and the street is quite noisy. Checking in and out went smoothly. Overall, I would recommend this apartment as it is good value for money."
3303857,19288395,2014-09-09,1032643,Josh,The Place was great with lots to see and do within walking distance.
3303857,19687918,2014-09-16,20120122,Yu,"The neighborhood is quite nice, and most of all very convenient if you are visiting UW -- only 10mins walk to the campus.  House looks kinda old, but I guess that is how things are in the city. 
  The internet speed is definitely something that can be improved! Quite slow at the peak time( night)."
3303857,37385819,2015-07-06,13116160,Aditi,"Melissa was a good host as she was accommodating with our request of checking in early. The place was basic and decent. Could have done with another fan in the living room, as it did become a bit muggy. The overall building getup wasn't the best, but the apartment itself was fine. The complex tends to get a bit noisy at night. "
3303857,38136717,2015-07-13,34408877,Michael,"I stayed at this apartment for four nights. My stay was very comfortable. The apartment was neat and tidy. The necessities - bedding, towels, kitchen utensils - were all provided. The WiFi also worked a treat. The location is incredibly convenient - a 5 minute walk away from the University of Washington and University Way, the local food hub. Noise at night was a non-issue. Given the price, I wasn't expecting anything grandiose as I suspect some previous reviewers were. The apartment met all my expectations. Overall, this was a nice apartment that would appeal to easygoing individuals who are just looking for a comfortable and convenient, yet inexpensive, place to stay when visiting Seattle."
3303857,39248303,2015-07-21,1538243,William & Lia,Although the host didn't answer as quickly as we wanted the place was 100% as seen in the photos. The neighborhood can be lively at odd hours but we felt safe and were super happy with the location.
3303857,44898380,2015-08-30,14452726,David,"Great experience. I rented the space for a month while I was doing an away rotation for medical school at UW. The apartment was perfect for what I needed: affordable and close proximity to UW clinics. Neighborhood is great with plenty in walking distance. Was a little hot without AC in August, but was I completely fine after purchasing an additional fan for the bedroom that I left in the unit (you are welcome). Street noise was a little loud at night, but quickly got use to it. No problems with hot water. I had an amazing month in Seattle and this apartment served as the perfect home base from which to explore this awesome city. I plan on staying again when I come back. "
3303857,47176365,2015-09-16,16736341,AbdulAziz,The place was clean and exactly as advertised. Very ckose to UW and in a nice neighborhood. I had limited interaction with Melissa and in those interaction she was super nice and helpfull. Highly recommended for anyone visiting UW.
4291,5473484,2013-07-01,4142203,Azita,"We had a great stay in Seattle, great location and the room was very clean.

The only thing we didn't feel comfortable with was the fact that we could not lock the door to our room from the outside.  There were two other rooms on the second floor which were rented out to other airbnb guests and the main door was left open during the day for the hair salon down below. We could only lock the door from the inside once we were in the room.  "
4291,5630770,2013-07-08,7306147,Bryant,Greatly enjoyed our quick stay here. We booked the same day or the day before and they happened to have the room available and check in and everything was a breeze. They do have a couple other rooms that had other airbnber's occupying it at the time and the room next door to us was occupied by a family member. The room is very roomy and plenty of space as well as the restroom. The location is kind of on a busy street and you do get the noise if you choose to leave your window open but that didn't seem to be much of a problem for us. The view at sunrise is to die for and I suggest waking up even if just to go back to sleep to see it!
4291,5739075,2013-07-14,7078957,Kathy & Keith,"We had a great experience in Seattle. We enjoyed the view of Ranier out the window. We were close to the starting point of the Cascade Cycling,Seattle to Portland  Ride which was why we were in Seattle. We would definitely stay there again. "
4291,6200737,2013-08-03,7229678,Roderic,"Good room, hosts , and location. Very positive experience for my first airbnb stay."
4291,6283627,2013-08-06,7443181,Louisa,"I had a very good experience staying with Jess and Joey at their home on 15th Ave. The house is conveniently located on a major thoroughfare in Seattle, about 10 minutes to the University District and 15 minutes downtown (driving). I was looking for accommodation as close as possible to a hotel, and this fit the bill. Guests enter through a separate door, so if you don't want to exchange pleasantries with your host or run into other guests, you won't here. It is very private and you're given a key upon arrival, so you can feel free to come and go as you please. My room (the suite) was very comfortable and had its own bathroom with shower. Amenities in the room included a TV, microwave, small fridge, robe, noise machine for sleeping and fan/heater. I asked for a hair dryer to be dropped off and they were very accommodating; you can simply ring them up if there are any problems. The house was quiet, and I got three good nights' sleep. The only thing to be aware of is that there is not an external lock on the doors for when you leave (you can lock yourself in when you're in the room, however). This was not a problem for me, but be aware of this incase you travel with expensive technology or are particularly cautious. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others -- thanks, Jess and Joey!"
4291,6376888,2013-08-10,7722528,Megan,"The Sunrise in Seattle Master Suite was perfect. Just what we were looking for at a truly AMAZING rate. What a steal. Jess & Joey were great hosts, easily reachable, and always prompt to reply. Chris and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will absolutely do so again. We highly recommend to anyone looking for a great space in the Seattle area! "
4291,6475856,2013-08-13,7921139,Charles,"We had a great three day stay in Seattle.  This location is convenient to I-5 and U Washington and  there are several restaurants and coffee shops within easy walking distance .  The best breakfast in Seattle is only a short drive away.  This is a comfortable, convenient place to stay."
4291,6918731,2013-08-30,7857256,Thomas,A great place to stay in Seattle. Nice big room with very comfy bed and excellent bathroom with a good bus link into downtown. 
4291,6995737,2013-09-02,3168696,Julia,"Great place, would love to stay again!"
4291,7343991,2013-09-16,8502576,Alex,"This great room matched up to all my expectations. Very clean and comfortable. Jess and Joey were very helpful in getting me booked and answered all my questions. Given the opportunity, I would stay here again!"
4291,14512840,2014-06-21,7280884,Marc,"Great location in Maple Leaf-- wonderful neighborhood with quite a bit within walking distance and a bus stop just steps away to get you downtown so you can avoid the drive.  Closer to a hotel room than a typical AirBnb setup- everything you need in the suite with your own private bathroom, tv, microwave and fridge.  Stayed for a few weeks and didn't see Jess & Joey all that much but they were always easy to get ahold of if anything came up and great to work with."
4291,16119733,2014-07-22,7630955,Rachael,"Great room and bathroom! 
We really liked the house and location- walked to Green Lake each day and swam and rented kayaks (1.5 miles away), and got coffee and breakfast at Cloud City Coffee (a few blocks away). Also the bus stop is literally a few houses away, and it is an easy ride to downtown. Comfortable bed; we were able to do laundry. Awesome! 
Only downside, the room overlooks a somewhat busy street, and we found the cars driving by to be loud. So bring your earplugs for sleeping."
4291,16667350,2014-07-31,17076034,Neal,"The room was as advertised. It was very spacious and the bathroom was large.  The room was located near the city as well as Northgate Mall.  Easy access to all travel points.  Only met Joey. Great host. All directions for use were (website hidden), fridge and microwave were available. HUGE CLOSET!!!
Room had an oscillating fan and casement windows. Good parking. Will come back. Quiet neighborhood. Beautiful views"
4291,17005389,2014-08-05,12133182,Lisa,"Jess was very welcoming and responsive in our email exchanges.  Though we didn't actually meet her, we did see Joey who was at the house, as he operates a hair salon directly below the room we booked.  There are several other rooms in the house that they also rent.  

The room was nice with the basic amenities, and the bed comfortable.  It overlooks a busy street, so a ""noise canceling machine"" is provided, plus a big fan which we put to use during the warm spell the four nights we were there. We appreciated the drinking water dispenser available on the ground floor.

While being shown the room, I found a 12 inch high pile of trash that had been left in a corner by the previous occupants; I mentioned it to Joey, and he took care of it right away.  Other than that, the room seemed clean.

We left each morning and didn't return until late at night.  The three requests we made while there----for several more wash cloths, an extra set of keys (there were two of us), and for the lights to the long outside entry stairs from the street to the house to be turned on/fixed----were denied. The hosts explained that they had other guests (no extra cloths),  privacy issues (no extra keys), and that the lights were set on a timer (which didn't work the four dark nights we were there, despite my asking about it twice).

Again, the hosts were both kind; we saw Joey several times (one morning he helped us use the washing machine to do one small load), and Jess was very nice in her emails. They seem genuinely committed to their Airbnb business, and I wish them all the best."
4291,17187882,2014-08-08,8605544,Paul,"Easy communication and their directions were clear and simple. Very convenient parking directly in front or across the street. The neighborhood is residential, which I appreciate. The room is spacious, and the bathroom is very nice too. Plenty of closet space, and refrigerator and microwave/TV, although I didn't use those. I agree with another reviewer that earplugs are a good idea because the street outside does tend to be fairly busy. I would definitely consider this option again."
4291,17799458,2014-08-17,12936567,Zilin,"highly recommend! great master bedroom, nice decoration. the hosts are very kind and lovely. i really like this place."
4291,18066365,2014-08-21,17924208,Ripple,"The room and bathroom were spacious and well-furnished! Both Joey and Jessie responded promptly to my voicemail message requesting an earlier check-in (which they were able to arrange). They were very gracious when I accidentally locked myself out of my room. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place! Be forewarned that if you leave the windows open overnight, the morning traffic might sound a little intrusive, but outside of that, I have no complaints!"
4291,18216962,2014-08-23,20239730,Clark,The room is gorgeous and is located in the maple leaf district within walking distance of multiple unique eateries.  I couldn't have asked for more! This was my first airbnb experience and I was very impressed.
4291,18324458,2014-08-25,17264322,Kris,Wonderful! Perfect for my needs - thankyou.
4291,18822336,2014-09-01,1343556,Susan,"My husband and I visited Seattle for a weekend en route to the Olympic National Park, and we loved our stay at Jess and Joey's Master Suite.  It was easy to find and parking was convenient (a major plus in Seattle).  The room (and the private bath) was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and pretty quiet.  Lots of nice little touches, including a refrigerator.  We had a chance to meet Jess and Joey as we were leaving and they were also off for a quick camping trip.  What a great couple!  We would happily stay here again next time we're in Seattle."
4291,19250516,2014-09-08,1421450,Whitney,We had a great stay. The room and bathroom were spacious and Jess was very quick to answer any questions. It was easy to get around Seattle as well.
4291,19504878,2014-09-13,6257658,Larry And Jennifer,"Great location! We found the room comfortable and large enough for our stay including the en-suite! The room is a bit outdated with an older TV and 2 remotes required to operate...a bit frustrating!
As hosts ourselves we expected some interaction with Jess and Joey to at least familiarize us with our surroundings such as good breakfast places, etc. The dishes we did use one morning sat outside our door overnight and were still there when we left. If you have a problem with stairs this is not the place for you as there are two sets of them before you get to the room with a burned out light bulb at the end. The street noise at night is quite loud especially having windows open as it gets quite warm when the weather is nice. The fan helped a lot. 
It appeared you have so much going on that perhaps your guests get forgotten. This is an honest appraisal of our stay and hope things go well with you both as hosts."
4291,19963405,2014-09-21,2516954,Simon,"Joey and Jess were warm and welcoming host. Big smile from them when I checked in. The room was large and very comfortable. Fluffy carpet, large wardrobe, bright and warm decor. Feels like a five star hotel. Large toilet too!!
Short walk to cafe and eateries. The location is safe and the neighbourhood has an air of serenity. I like the Maple Leaf park. Good for my run. 
The house is on high ground which gives a nice view on clear day. I enjoyed my stay. Thanks!!"
4291,20392431,2014-09-28,15145674,David,"Sometimes, you just have bad luck and are thrust into a bad situation. After the previous stay, the hosts left the windows (no screen) open for a number of days before I arrived. This led to a number of ""stink"" bugs that I discovered throughout my stay. As I believe the hosts that this was the first time this has happened, this was simply an unlucky event. But, the situation was handled professionally and with great care and the hosts have communicated that they will now be getting screens for all their windows. Ideally, nothing would go wrong, but when it does it matters how they are handled and Joey handled this issue with care and class. "

Jess was responsive to inquiries, directions and instructions on where to find keys/etc. excellent.  Room was comfortable, clean and a pretty good size.  Bathroom also very clean, a good size and must have been new.  I am relocating to Seattle and wanted to get a feel for the neighborhood, which I did.  Short walk to Cloud City Coffee shop which was great, and an ale house and Chinese restaurant that were both quite good.  Maple Leaf park also a short walk"
4291,32326554,2015-05-17,2084798,Theresa,We love staying at Joey & Jess' House.   They are always super responsive if there is ever a question.  The place is in a quiet neighborhood and about a 15 min drive to downtown. Thanks guys!  Can't wait to stay there again!
4291,34969502,2015-06-14,31548221,David,"Besides losing my keys to the room, things were great. I met Joey a few times and he was very nice. They solved my lost keys problem with a phone call, and a great back up plan.  The room was spacious and comfortable. I didn't spend too much time there, but the bed was very comfortable."
4291,42014445,2015-08-10,23991312,Thomas,Everything went smoothly.
4291,42590186,2015-08-14,39859345,Kathy,We had an amazing experience for our very first time using Airbnb. The room was very private and beautiful and Jess & Joey are incredible people and we can not say enough about them or our accommodations. We were blessed to have met them and look forward to another trip one day to Seattle . Thank you guys for the lovely time! Xoxo
4291,43734499,2015-08-21,40799772,Hailey,"The Sunrise in Seattle Master Suite was absolutely perfect for our quick vacation to Seattle! It was in a great location and accommodated all our needs. Jess and Joey were wonderful Hosts, very easy going and very communicative! We would love having the pleasure of staying here again our next trip to Seattle. Thanks Jess and Joey! "
4291,44003598,2015-08-23,1205131,Joseph,"The house is big, and the room has everything you need. We enjoyed our stay very much and strongly recommend this nice, clean and comfortable place to anyone!"
4291,46048339,2015-09-07,18217342,Vanessa,"My stay in the Sunrise Suite was exactly what I was looking for,  private and comfortable. Jess was very accommodating and let me arrive early. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Checking in and out was very convenient and easy. Thanks for your hospitality! "
4291,48612555,2015-09-27,15034587,Heeja,I stayed 2 nights at Jess & Joey's place it was very clean and comfortable and just about 10 minutes away from UW. Thanks letting me stay at your place
4291,51219780,2015-10-18,17652256,Sebrina,Great location. Close to W University and downtown. Looked exactly like in the picture. Hosts are friendly and free water is served. I am happy with my stay.
4129218,56577390,2015-12-14,51036041,Erik,"Derek was very welcoming and went out of his way to be sure that everything about his apartment went smoothly.  This apartment is modern and clean.  It comfortably sleeps 4 and decor and lacks for nothing.  Kitchen is fully functional.  Bathroom works with style.  Open space kitchen living room sleep area has a nice flow.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Everything in this apartment is up to date with modern look.  I feel that I got my money's worth and more.  Within one block of the main street on Capital Hill, its location is perfect.  If you want a memorable Seattle experience, try Derek's.  Don't think you will be disappointed."
4129218,57887446,2015-12-30,47221446,Anne,"We had a great time staying in this studio apartment in Seattle.  Derek was a nice host, and we had a few requests which he fixed immediately. The location is very good close to Broadway with lots of restaurants, stores and bars close by. The apartment is in the basement with neighbors upstairs, and we could hear a little too much from them from time to time. Other than that it was a great stay. "
1799255,9839278,2014-01-13,3299833,Michelle,"What a wonderful stay!  Lovely home, welcoming host and Ollie and Gertie were delightful.  Convenient location in a beautiful area of Seattle!"
1799255,9920917,2014-01-19,3551468,Belle,"Excellent, high class at an affordable price. Highly recommended. Sharon is kind, hip, and her dogs are super cute. The house is lovely, and chic. I highly recommend staying here, its very private and Sharon is cool. Unless booked, Sharon's place will be my go to stay when in the Seattle area. "
1799255,9979636,2014-01-22,3551468,Belle,"Sharon was warm, friendly, welcoming, un-intrusive and very hospitable. Her home is warm, quiet, cozy, charming, and well decorated with a sophisticated quality taste. Its in an early century affluent, quiet neighborhood on the very top of Queen Ann Hill away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to the ave. 

Queen Ann has its own restaurant and shopping district called the Ave. which is 3 blocks from Sharon's lovely home. The restaurants are wonderful, we tried several on our trip, and all were equally delicious with respectful wait staff. Sharon offers fabulous coffee to wake up, but if you need your Starbucks, its right around the corner.  

The park on Queen Ann is another reason to stay at Sharon's, the best view of Mt. Rainer and Seattle skyline no doubt! Downtown is easy by either car, bus or walking. This was a fabulous location for us, because we needed to go downtown several times during our trip. 

The high speed internet was fast and reliable. Our sleep was so quiet and comfortable, with goose down bedding, a quality mattress, and even a fresh floral arrangement on the nightstand. Just lovely. We will be back. 

Oh, and we already miss her poodle mixes, Ollie and Gertie. Such friendly and well behaved, loving dogs. "
1799255,10168439,2014-02-03,9090029,Marilyn,"I enjoyed staying at Sharon's place on Queen Anne Hill.  She is a warm and welcoming host and the accommodations are pretty, clean and private.  I will definitely stay there again when I am visiting Seattle."
1799255,10909552,2014-03-12,10537679,Warnar,"Sharon was the perfect host.  She was so welcoming and accommodating. Her house is conveniently located near many restaurants (Mexican and Thai, just to mention a few) and a super market that are within walking distance.
When she said, ""Mi casa es su casa"" she literally meant it.  I felt as if I was still in the comfort of my own home. Ollie and Gertie were awesome host also, they are such well behaved dogs."
1799255,11334760,2014-03-30,7900384,Ann,"Sharon was very friendly and welcoming, and her house is lovely and located in a terrific neighborhood.  The bedroom and adjoining bathroom were very comfortable, and can be closed off from the rest of the house to feel like a private suite!  Sharon offered great advice on bus routes and nearby restaurants, gave me some free bus passes, and even gave me a ride to the Seattle Center on her way to work one morning.  She made me feel at home, and let me use her kitchen to make my own breakfasts and lunches.  Her dogs are very friendly and sweet.  I'd happily stay there again."
1799255,11497000,2014-04-05,4994359,Linda,"This home is very charming and well arranged. The wing for the bedroom and bath are exceedingly well placed so that you feel you are in a little cottage, very private. The view into the back yard and nearby trees is very pretty with W facing light. There is a sitting area and good wifi, a super bathroom with tiled shower.
Perfect for one or two persons. I extended a third night because I felt so comfortable and relaxed. Sharon is a convivial and thoughtful host indeed.
Walk to anything Queen Anne. Even better little town feel and safe lovely area than you could imagine. "
1799255,12258017,2014-04-27,544440,Clayton,"Sharon was a great host and it's hard not to love her two very friendly, furry helpers. Her home is clean, welcoming, and a great fit for 1-2 people. Located within a charming, walkable neighborhood, it's only 3 blocks from all the coffee shops, restaurants and stores Queen Anne has to offer."
1799255,12663561,2014-05-07,13843703,George,"Sharon, and her furry family were terrific hosts. It is a welcoming and comfortable place that is private (if you want) and still have access to the whole house. We will be back."
1799255,13424652,2014-05-27,14515824,Bonnie,"This was a perfect first Air bnb experience for us: a gracious  hostess, and perfect location for attending NWFolklife Festival at Seattle Center.  The house is charming, and the neighborhood was fun to explore. Sharon was very attentive, and we felt like we were staying with a long lost friend.  "
1799255,13978488,2014-06-09,15584823,Tom,We had a great time at Cozy Queen Anne Cottage.  Very quiet neighborhood- even slept with windows open and it was quiet!  Sharon was a wonderful host and we will be coming back.  If you are looking for a great place to stay in (email hidden)is is the place....
1799255,14285786,2014-06-16,3166416,Rick,Great location! Sharon is also a very good host and a pleasure to talk to. Room and private bath are very convenient.
1799255,14441557,2014-06-19,15947139,Margie,"Sharon is a delightful hostess.  Her home is in the loveliest of neighborhoods with excellent shops and restaurants nearby.  The guest room and bathroom and clean, private and inviting.  A walk to Kerry Park is a must for the quintessential view of Seattle!"
1799255,15761144,2014-07-15,5211706,Jeff,"Our stay with Sharon was absolutely perfect. When we arrived, she was there to show us around the house and eager to tell us about the place places to visit in her neighborhood and in Seattle in general. Absolutely great host with great recommendations (and we couldn't get enough of the dogs!)

The Queen Anne neighborhood is a great place for checking out restaurants, cafes, and pretty much anything you can think of. I highly recommend this area, but most of all this host, for any Airbnbers looking to spend some time in the Seattle area.

Thanks Sharon! We'll be back in the future.

Jeff and Meg

1799255,15881034,2014-07-17,8631573,Kate,"Sharon was a gracious host and her home is lovely! I enjoyed my stay with her and appreciated having my own suite! Ollie and Gerty (Sharon's dogs) greeted me each morning and evening so it felt like home. Thank you, Sharon! I'll be back!"
1799255,16201851,2014-07-23,11232687,Allan,"I greatly enjoyed my five-day stay in Sharon's cottage. The room and the adjoining bathroom, sequestered from the rest of the house, afforded all the privacy and comfort I desired. The kitchen has everything a gourmet cook could desire, and I made good use of it for breakfasts and for two evening meals.

 I loved the neighborhood, with its wonderful diversity of older houses, most of them as charming as Sharon's.  Restaurants and shopping are only a four-block walk to the west, mansions and views over Lake a Union an equal distance to the east. After (email hidden) Cottage you will want to move to this neighborhood.



"
1799255,16608752,2014-07-30,15481444,Joyce,"This Queen Anne cottage is cozy, comfortable, and comes with two affectionate dogs as well as a host who is a traveler herself and always interested in other travelers' experiences. This was so much better than a hotel --  we had complete privacy in our area of the house, but also had access to a kitchen, terrace, and garden.  The mattress and bedding were soft and comfortable, so we slept well even though the bed was not as wide as the king we are used to. Sharon was accommodating in every way and went to extra lengths to ensure we had coffee to our liking, and in the evening, wine.  We had a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to go back."
1799255,16830669,2014-08-03,15396852,Elizabeth,"I really enjoyed my stay with Sharon, and her furry buddies! Her home was so comfortable and welcoming, and had easy walking access to public transit and all the amenities of Queen Anne. The en suite room and bathroom exceeded my expectations, it was cozy with fresh flowers and can be as private as you would like it to be from the rest of the home.  She welcomed me with freshly picked blueberries and we sat out in the garden to chat while sipping iced tea.  Sharon is an easy going host, who helped me with directions, and when my friend who was supposed to pick me up on the check out day was delayed, Sharon kindly let me stay and read a novel while curled up with the dogs. That was greatly appreciated! This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was excellent.  The next time I come to Seattle, I will most definitely book with her again! "
1799255,16990533,2014-08-05,16926054,Lenka,"Super place to stay! Pretty house with gardens located 10mins away by bus from downtown in a walkable area (around the corner from some fabulous restaurants...try How to Cook a Wolf). We had a cozy and lovely room with a private bathroom in our own wing of the house. Sharon is a very nice person who served us excellent coffee (better than some of the most famous coffee places in town), chatted with us and made us feel at home. We even had a nice rose wine on her patio when she had guests for dinner. The dogs are very friendly and will pledge eternal love to guests who will throw tennis balls for them to fetch. Great place in great city. Highly recommended! "
1799255,18002164,2014-08-20,16464439,Leslie,"The walk from the Clipper to Sharon's is not for the faint of heart. We had just completed a 75km hike so felt up for the big climb. Sharon had advised us to take a taxi, but we enjoyed the beautiful walk and were warmly greeted by Sharon with much appreciated refreshments.
Her lovely house in a quiet neighbourhood was exactly as described, as were Ollie and Greta, who we nice substitutes for our two dogs left behind. 
We hadn't really done our holiday research on Seattle so we appreciated that Sharon had put together some maps, map books and even printed out some maps for us. She directed us to restaraunts and sites that lived up to their expectations.
We really enjoyed the Queen Anne Neighbourhood and all its amenities including great grocery stores, resteraunts, coffee shops etc. all within easy walking distance.
We felt really comfortable with Sharon and in her home and all in all it was a great first airbnb experience.
Thanks Sharon!"

She was so welcoming and helpful with information about visiting and living in Seattle (we are considering moving to the city in the near future).  Our space was clean and comfortable.  And the best part of our stay was Gertie and Ollie, her two dogs!  These furry friends were so wonderful and made the place feel like home.  We miss them already!"
1799255,18472123,2014-08-27,16675661,Kathryn,We were very comfortable at Sharon's lovely house and would stay there again.  It was lovely to meet Sharon.

1799255,19516624,2014-09-14,11385600,Jingjing,"Staying at Sharon's actually also my first airbnb experience, and also my first time to the states. She was really friendly and kind in helping whenever I needed. Her 2 dogs were lovely, and for a dog lover like me, it just made the entire experience so much better. Sharon's place is just a short walk to the main street of Queen Anne with many good eateries nearby. I highly recommend people to stay at her place. "
1799255,19780769,2014-09-18,8631573,Kate,"I feel very at home at Sharon's! Her lovely decor, her welcoming demeanor, and her welcoming committee (Ollie & Gertie!) all make her place my favorite place to stay when I come to Seattle. It's so nice to have a private suite to relax in & to count on a great night's sleep! Thank you again, Sharon!"
1799255,21085106,2014-10-11,2449687,Chris,"Sharon was warm and welcoming, and so were my accommodations.  The bed was really comfortable and I languished in the shower for a while before my early departure.  Parking was more than simple,  You can't go wrong here.  I'd stay again with no hesitation."
1799255,22154555,2014-10-31,22253723,Jane,Try to get rid of the heavy dog smell or advertise that the two dogs are just that dogs...and dogs don't smell like humans.  I loved the place tho and after a few minutes the smell is not noticeable.  
1799255,22331233,2014-11-03,22772347,Mike,"Sharon, was so cheerful, welcoming &  helpful in so many ways.  Providing map, directions and suggestions for the area was so helpful for me getting around by walking and the bus. The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful and felt very safe.  Her  sweet & wonderful dogs, Gerti & Ollie promptly welcomed you and very well mannered.  The  room & private bath were comfortable, spacious and private  from the main area of the house.  Her warm hospitality with a wonderful cup of coffee & newspaper or a glass of wine in the evening made this first airbnb experience wonderful.  I am looking forward to returning.
"
1799255,22709988,2014-11-12,13288883,James,"This was a great place to stay. It is in a quiet and conveniently located neighborhood with the best views of Seattle. The room and bathroom were private and comfortable. But the best part, and what makes AirBnb unique, was getting to meet Sharon. Ollie and Gertie were a bonus -- two gregarious dogs with unforgettable personalities. Also, try Sharon's coffee -- you'll soon understand why Starbucks has its origins in this city. Overall, great hospitality and a great place. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
1799255,23150959,2014-11-24,2479466,Erin,"Sharon was a great host with a lovely home in a neighborhood that's really convenient to downtown. The room and bath offer plenty of privacy, and I really enjoyed the chances that I had to visit with Sharon and hang out with the puppies. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Seattle."
1799255,25285472,2015-01-11,24901001,Barry,"I felt absoulutely at home in Sharon's place from the moment my wife and I arrived. This is also because Oli and Gertie (her two labradoodles) are a great welcoming committee! Sharon is a very warm person: caring, conversant and intelligent.  

The neighborhood is safe and many good restaurants to test out. "
1799255,25569664,2015-01-19,25826689,Terry,"Host was there when we arrived. Offered coffee and tea and helped us find a restaurant where we planned to meet our daughter,"
1799255,26442730,2015-02-13,25281983,Lucas,"We very much enjoyed our stay with Sharon. She has a wonderful home and two affectionate dogs. The semi-private bed and bath has a hallway that can be closed to the rest of the house, which was nice. The bath had two sinks which was nice luxury for us.  Towels, soap, and shampoo were all easily available. The shared rooms have ample comfortable sitting area for  lounging. We had no problems sharing the TV in the common area or using the kitchen. We prepared many of our meals at the house. The dogs are nice and gentle even though one is quite big. He is very affectionate and loves to flop down with you on the couch. 

Shopping and public transportation is a walk of only a few blocks. Trader Joe's, Safeway, and many good restaurants are close by.

Sharon was a generous host and shared much about the area. She even picked up a local copy of the Seattle magazine after learning we were moving to the area. Once we move to Seattle I expect we will stop by again and introduce our dog!"
1799255,26633184,2015-02-16,23748125,Mary,Sharon and her dogs are most welcoming. I felt right at home.
1799255,27588327,2015-03-08,27114993,Sarah,"What a lovely, cute little home! Sharon is such a great and sweet host and would recommend renting this private room when staying in Seattle. She was not only welcoming from start to finish, but very respectful of our space. There are separate doors to close off the bathrooms/rooms. The bed is very comfortable and slept like a baby for all 3 nights! Sharon also has the sweetest 2 dogs that are lovable and makes the stay even more comforting. Queen Anne is the perfect location to stay, especially at this location, very close by to attractions, coffee shops and brunch spots. Ask Sharon anything, she will be very helpful and willing to help with your stay. "
1799255,27742571,2015-03-10,401429,Molly,"Sharon is a great host! Very accommodating and friendly. She also has two of the sweetest dogs!

The house/room is beautiful, and in a really lovely part of town. It's also very close to bus lines that take you right to the city center in ~15 minutes. "
1799255,28879462,2015-03-31,11308629,James,"Very charming and comfortable home in a great neighborhood, easily accessible to downtown Seattle but also many amenities within walking distance.  Sharon was an informative, attentive and gracious host and made our stay pleasant and relaxed.  This was my first Airbnb experience and was a shining example of what I had hoped to find in an accommodation.  Thanks again Sharon! "
1799255,29876767,2015-04-13,16781490,Korbi,"I enjoyed staying with Sharon! Her house was sunny and she was delightful to talk with each evening. The house was really convenient as well, right on multiple bus lines that zipped me downtown. Thanks for the great week Sharon! "
1799255,31338304,2015-05-04,17728095,Scott,"Sharon was great. Nice room in a fantastic home beautiful part of the city. Room is really like a private apartment. Dogs were playful and loving. I would highly suggest you stay with Sharon, she really wants you to enjoy your time in the city and is very helpful in guiding you to things you should see and do."
1799255,31912075,2015-05-11,30792915,Luan,It was an amazing journey in Seattle hosted by Sharon. It's a lovely house with two friendly dogs. And it is a great district with easy access to market. I really look forward to come back in my next trip to Seattle.  
1799255,32100727,2015-05-14,23722805,Lisa,"We had a wonderful stay in this quiet Airbnb that's close to upper Queen Anne and all the ambience of that part of Seattle.  Room was comfortable and bed perfect.  Sharon's a wonderful host and we'd stay thee again.  Easy to get to from airport using Light Rail and bus # 3 or 4.  Great find!

Her dogs, Ollie and Gertie are charming and friendly:)"
1799255,32590954,2015-05-19,25826689,Terry,"We had been to Sharon's once before so it felt familiar and comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood is very nice. 
The house is close to Queen Anne Avenue, which is the Main 
Street for Queen Anne Hill. It is a well designed, interesting
and lively shopping district."
1799255,34425172,2015-06-08,30601663,William,"Sharon was an excellent host, I couldn't have asked for a better first Airbnb experience! She was welcoming and offered up her home as if were ours and made us immediately feel welcome. 

She provided valuable information prior to arrival on the area based on our form of transportation and accommodated our bike rentals and rental car with no issues. Additionally she gave us unique ideas on things to do in town including a bike path map and a magazine on outdoor hikes based on our conversations before arriving. 

Upon arriving the house/room was clean and as advertised, it was nice being greeted by her dogs Ollie and Gertie. We enjoyed Sharon's company and her recommendations were always spot on. The neighborhood was ideally located in Seattle to easily navigate to all the other districts and tourists attractions. The house and neighborhood were quiet to boot which was nice a full day of sightseeing or hiking. 

I would gladly recommend anyone to stay with Sharon! "
1799255,35570832,2015-06-20,422245,Juliet,"Sharon is a very welcoming, friendly, and attentive host. We felt like we were staying with an old friend and she made everything so easy for us. She even let us stow our humongous suitcase with her at work when we got in from the airport so we could explore around the first day without having to schlep it with us. Her dogs, Ollie and Gert, are the sweetest. Her home is cozy, the bedroom comfortable and peaceful, and we especially loved hanging out on the back patio. Queen Anne was the perfect home base to start our adventures every morning, but it's also fun to just hang out and relax in the neighborhood. Between walking, buses, and uber, we easily got everywhere we wanted to be. All in all, Sharon made it possible for us to have an awesome Seattle vacation. We hope to come back soon!"
1799255,36552772,2015-06-29,33360449,Kathleen,"Sharon is very friendly and welcoming. The room she rents, along with private bath, is very comfortable and well-equipped. She has added some lovely finishing touches, not the least of which were soft sheets and feather pillows! I'm not sure I can think of any area for improvement. My stay was quite comfortable and I would certainly return."
1799255,37827200,2015-07-11,1495347,Beth Anne,"Sharon and her dogs made our brief stay very welcoming, comfortable and relaxing.  I hope to book again on our next visit to Seattle.  Sharon is an excellent ambassador for the city of Seattle, and her home is perfectly located for exploring the city."
1799255,38163153,2015-07-13,31544566,Caitlin,This was my boyfriend and mine's first time using an AirBNB and I don't know if we'll ever get this lucky again. Sharon was very accommodating of our schedule and had a great welcome packet that included maps and guides to let us hit the ground running. She was friendly but not intrusive at all. It was an overall great stay. The bedroom and bathroom were in their own private section of the house with its own door and the yard was a nice space to relax in after a day of exploring. The neighborhood is cute with many restaurants in walking distance and a good bus line a block or two away. 
1799255,38397572,2015-07-15,7740000,Karen,"Sharon greeted us with a marvelous smile, maps to get you oriented, and glass of lemonade. Don't be put off by the dog aroma in the front entrance - the house is wonderful, very quiet, very clean, and nice to have a separated room and bathroom. The Queen Anne neighborhood is lovely (lavender, rosemary, and flowers growing by the roadside!) and bus lines 3, 4, and 13 run right into the city centre. "
1799255,43229752,2015-08-18,27011225,Daniel,"Sharon made us feel very welcome. The room was very comfortable and was as described, and the neighborhood was great. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others."
1799255,44105992,2015-08-24,22959912,Kelly,"Staying in Sharon's home was wonderful!  Her yard is as picturesque as the rest of the Queen Anne neighborhood.  You immediately feel at home when you walk through the gate.  The inside of the house is clean and cozy as pictured.  The bedroom and bathroom have a very private feel, as they can be closed off from the rest of the house.  This made our stay feel like a little retreat.  I would definitely stay there again!"
1799255,49653082,2015-10-05,23978084,Simon,"Sharon was a perfect host. On one hand she was very courtesly and helpful, we had nice conversations in the morning or in the evening and received lots of good information about seattle from her. on other hand we could recover in the private guest area of her cozy house, if we wanted to. Her dogs are absolutely adorable and so sweet. Leaving seattle we realized, staying at Sharons home was the actual highlight of our visit. Thanks Sharon!"
1799255,50484968,2015-10-12,18171197,Farida,"Sharon was a gracious, friendly host who helped us find our way to many Seattle attractions. The room was attractive, quiet, and private, the house is cozy and charming.  Interesting restaurants nearby and convenient bus stop."
1799255,51474711,2015-10-20,45380175,Megan,"Sharon was a great host!  She was welcoming when we arrived and gave us maps and detailed instructions about how to see the public transportation system.  The house was really clean and her dogs were so sweet.  Our room was spacious, clean and exactly what we were looking for.  It was great to have our private bathroom and the door that closed us off from the common space.  Sharon also provided us with coffee and tea in the morning.
The neighborhood of Queen Anne was lovely.  We enjoyed the short walk from Sharon's home to the cute and quaint downtown area and definitely recommend Le Reve, an adorable French bakery and coffee shop just around the corner.  
We definitely recommend Sharon and hope to visit Seattle again soon!"
1799255,52146507,2015-10-26,25826689,Terry,"By pre-arrangement, the host left a key for us under the front
mat. Everything was tidy and all our needs were met. We love
the neighborhood, especially its proximity to Queen Anne Avenue
North, where our daughter lives.
Thank you, Sharon."
1799255,54265976,2015-11-17,13833796,Casey,"Nothing but great things to say about Sharon and her amazing cottage!  Sharon was so kind and welcoming, we felt right at home!  She even invited us to watch the Seahawks game with her!  Her two dogs are so awesome as well :) 

Queen Anne is such great neighborhood, and this place is in the heart of it!  5 minute walk from some amazing restaurants / shops, etc.  So so safe and quiet too!

Our room and private bathroom were wonderful, more than enough separation from the rest of the house!  100% would stay again and recommend to anyone coming through the area.
"
491958,1667700,2012-07-09,2595909,Alyson,"Jay, Colleen, Mica & Gigi-dog were excellent hosts! They welcomed us with warm and cheerful greetings as well as a delicious treat from the local bakery! They even delivered us a fan when the weather was projected to climb above 75, which was so considerate, although, the majority of the trip we thoroughly enjoyed having all the windows open to allow for the cool & crisp Seattle breeze to set the temperature of the apartment. Jay took the time to share some gems with us on good places to eat, event happenings and must-do activities in the charming Columbia City area as well as greater Seattle. After that, they allowed us total privacy in our treehouse apartment retreat. The apartment was our perfect home away from home after expoloring all that Columbia City and Seattle has to offer. In Columbia City, we hit up the local Farmer's Market, listened to some great live music during Beatwalk, perused the little shops and galleries and enjoyed delicious coffee and meals all within walking distance of the house. The location is convenient to the major highways as well, so downtown and the airport were extremely accessible and just a quick 10-15 minute drive. The apartment is just as described and pictured, immaculately clean with all the bases covered. The bed was extrmemely plush and comfortable, probably some of the best sleep we've had in a long while. We had a truly wonderful experience and would highly recommend Jay and his Columbia City Treehouse to anyone visiting Seattle!"
491958,1691431,2012-07-12,206203,Amanda,Wonderful place in a great neighborhood near much of the best of Seattle. The place was clean. Check in and out easy. The Rood's were very nice and helpful. I would highly recommend it. Loved the treehouse feeling.
491958,1819816,2012-07-28,1183129,Kristen,"Lovely, very clean, little apartment under a large tree (thus ""the treehouse"").  It was bigger than the pictures portray and perfect for my brother and I to stay in different rooms. Jay and his family were very accommodating and GiGi the dog greeted us as we came and went.  I would definitely recommend this place!"
491958,1837775,2012-07-30,698208,Lauren,"A very clean little apartment, everything feels brand new. A long walk from the business area of Columbia City, it would be best to have a car. The hosts were friendly without being intrusive. It feels like the countryside out there!"
491958,1982895,2012-08-14,2798193,Volker,Seattle is a very nice and lovely town as much ist Jays treehouse. ItÂ´s small but really clean and we enjoyed our stay especially the big balcony under the tree. Jay is a helpful host who provided us with books and maps of Seattle. 
491958,2159496,2012-09-01,1389821,Franka,"We enjoyed our stay tremendously- so much that we will soon be back!

491958,2240116,2012-09-09,3236302,Huichao,"Convenient location and quiet, nice community! I stayed here for two nights with my parents and my sister. We really appreciate the home feel here and making breakfast together every morning. All facilities are great. The host is very friendly and helpful. Strongly recommended to couples with/without a child."
491958,2278746,2012-09-14,2926747,Vanessa,"My mother and I had such a wonderful experience at the treehouse apartment!  It was clean, quiet, comfortable and beautiful and had with a well equip kitchen that we took full advantage of!  Our hosts were kind,  helpful, respectful of our space and flexible with our schedule.  It was a nice walk (about 1/4 mile and hilly which could be hard for some) down to the super cute columbia city strip, where there were some great cafes, shops, bars/live music venues,  a bakery and a yoga studio.    It was also a good walk/short drive away from a local organic co-op where we did our grocery shopping for the stay.   

Columbia City is a great neighborhood -- a bit removed from downtown, but this apartment is close enough to public transit to make it a relatively easy commute anywhere.  

Highly recommended! "
491958,2351321,2012-09-20,1552491,Elizabeth,"This was ideal for my husband and me.  Couldn't have worked better.  Very comfortable, spacious and quiet.. Our daughter lives close by so the location was great too."
491958,2418664,2012-09-26,2100129,Mike,"My wife, sister-in-law, and I stayed for 3 nights, and we have nothing but positive things to say about our stay.  First of all, the space was modernized, clean, fun, accommodating, and-- did I say-- clean?  Careful thought was put into the guests' experience, and I truly appreciate that. Jay and the gang were fun and down-to-earth. The bathroom was fully stocked with CLEAN towels and soap, and the kitchen was also stocked with plenty of dishes, rags, coffee mugs, appliances, dish soap, bottle opener, and just about anything else we needed during the stay. I am so pleased to leave high marks for Jay and our stay at his Treehouse Apt. "
491958,2543082,2012-10-08,3593562,Gary,"Nice clean place with everything we needed for a great stay.   Kitchen was well equipped and also had a microwave which we didn't see listed in the description.  Light, airy, nice location, walking distance to Columbia City shops and restaurants, as well as to the Columbia City Light Rail station for trips to/from SeaTac and/or downtown.   Short drive to beautiful Seward Park with spectacular views of Mt. Rainier on a clear day.    Fast WIFI, and greatly appreciated the bathtub after a long day walking all over downtown Seattle.  Jay was great and his dog Gigi was an added bonus!  "
491958,2588749,2012-10-12,206203,Amanda,"The Columbia City Treehouse is comfortable, quiet and in a great Seattle neighborhood. Jay is a good communicator and check in and out is simple. This was my second stay here and I once again enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend it!"
491958,2840967,2012-11-08,2691686,Maura,Apartment was awesome and as described.  Will visit again.
491958,3043693,2012-12-08,206203,Amanda,"The Columbia City Treehouse is a wonderful, quiet, and private hotel alternative in a great neighborhood. Jay and his family are really nice, interesting and helpful people. The place is pictured accurately, clean, and has a very comfortable bed. You can't go wrong staying here!"
491958,3317709,2013-01-09,4469811,Marco,"The Treehouse is great! Before heading to the apartment, Jay established himself as a friendly, good communicator who was willing to be flexible. Our stay was great - the apartment was spotless and tidy and you could tell the hosts took pride in their space. Of note was a great heater, lots of clean extra sheets and towels, TV/Cable/Wireless, and a great kitchen. It was the perfect home during our Seattle stay - about a 10 minute walk from the light rail to the airport and downtown, and even closer to buses. Jay was also just a nice guy who gave us plenty of space but was also open to any questions we may have had. Highly recommended!"
491958,3340396,2013-01-13,4611060,Marleigh,Our hosts were very friendly and accomodating. The treehouse apartment was perfect for our stay. We would definitely stay there again.
491958,3416412,2013-01-26,4612087,Hana,"I really enjoyed my stay! The property is very nice and the neighborhood is great. The treehouse has a great layout to utilize all the space. The bed is comfortable, couch too, the kitchen is brand new looking with garbage disposal and all the pots/pans/utensils/dishes you would need, the bathroom has a full bathtub and the deck is a good size. Jay was very easy to work with and I would defiantly recommend this rental. "
491958,3435450,2013-01-29,4254939,Annette,"The Treehouse at Columbia City was wonderful!  It was very clean and nicely organized.  I felt very safe there and slept great on the very comfy bed.  In the morning I enjoyed coffee made in the French press - the first time I ever used one, and I loved the flavor of the coffee, which I had picked up in a little gourmet shop downtown.  There was a toaster and pots and pans for cooking, plus a dishwasher.  Clean up was easy!  I could listen to music on the CD player, or watch TV when it was time to relax.  It was about a 20 minute walk to the Light Rail when I decided not to drive my rental car.  All very nice!  
 "
491958,3675268,2013-03-03,4500867,Denise,"This worked very well for us.  It is well furnished, very clean and the view was lovely.  Lots of windows was a plus.  The queen bed was very comfortable.  Loved the world map on the shower curtain!  The owner responded promptly to emails and phone calls, and was available to give us a key when we arrived.   "
491958,3790595,2013-03-15,423408,Kirsten,"My boyfriend and I visited Seattle for 5 nights and the treehouse apartment was great! The kitchen was well-stocked and we had everything we needed to cook and relax. The location is very good, as long as you don't mind a bit of a walk to the metro. Jay was very friendly and welcoming; we would definitely stay here again!"
491958,3852493,2013-03-21,4166006,Casey,My in-laws stayed at the C.C. Treehouse Apt.  for a week.  The apartment was very clean and inviting.  Everyone felt comfortable and cared for.  Jay was always accommodating and friendly.  In all of our email and phone correspondence he was very prompt in responding.  I will be encouraging the rest of my family and friends to stay here when visiting Seattle!
491958,3874121,2013-03-23,2615863,SJ And Nat,"We loved Jay's treehouse - one of the highlights of our Round-the-World trip. The apartment adjoins the main house but is completely separate, and you do almost feel like you're in your own little 'treehouse'. It is the perfect size for a couple, cleverly designed, with all the amenities we needed for our two night stay. 

The neighbourhood is a delight, peaceful but close enough to drive right into Seattle, should one wish to do so. We chose to catch the LINK train, which was an easy walk away through downtown Columbia City's buzzing hub, and then 15 mins ride to downtown Seattle. Super easy and super green (but you could take your car close to the station should you wish to). Columbia City is worth a mooch in itself - we loved it so much we want to move there!

The local area is so relaxing, there's beautiful Lake Washington nearby, and a great PCC for groceries - fab pizzas and organic wine.

Jay was an excellent host, he was quick to respond and gave us all the information we needed. He was available if we needed anything, but left us in total privacy for our stay.

We're only sorry we couldn't stay longer - thanks Jay and family!"
491958,4096690,2013-04-09,91381,Antje,"I am grateful for the opportunity that I was able to stay at your lovely ""TreeHouse apartmentâ.  It was wonderful! The apartment is well laid out with all the basic amenities one needs to make you feel right at home. The location was convenient for going around Seattle. Downtown is just a quick train ride away and buses are easily available to get to and from places. It's a great neighborhood too - lots of places like grocery store, restaurants and coffee shop, are within walking distance. And best of all, it is right by Lake Washington and Seward Park. The host himself is super nice and readily available when you need help. I definitely recommend this apartment for a great stay in Seattle. Thank you again Jay for everything!!!  :)"
491958,4141250,2013-04-13,5756421,Janet,"We spent 5 nights at the tree house in Columbia City and it was fabulous! The place is clean, well-organized and super quiet. It is cozy but big enough for our 2 kids (3 & 6) and us.  The beds are very comfortable (especially the futon in the living area).  I recommend the Tree House to anyone looking for a great location to stay in Seattle.  Best of all, Jay, the owner, is a kind and wonderful host!  "
491958,4479628,2013-05-07,5777199,GisÃ¨le,"My daughter and I had a beautiful time in Seattle and the tree house was perfect : easy access dowtown, then peace and quiet in a clean and well equipped apartment, then the other side of Seattle : the lake, the parks, the people... and trees and flowers blooming everywhere. Jay was a perfect host - available but discreet. Glad to have seen the best of the city!"
491958,4604482,2013-05-14,6200381,Adrianne,We used Jays place when we were visiting our new grand-daughter in columbia city. The treehouse is secluded and private. Jay is super friendly and the room had everything we needed. We thought it was great and we will use it again. We loved it!
491958,4771741,2013-05-25,5754736,Elizabeth,"Jay was very easygoing. He gave us easy directions to the rail which is a short walk from the house. We left our car parked at his house and took the rail to the city center which saved a lot on parking fees. The treehouse is very clean and bright with many windows. We actually went out to buy a deck of cards one night, but later realized there was a deck provided under the tv. There was also a binder of maps, sights to see and bus schedules in the apartment. Jay's place is recommended by me!"
491958,4830813,2013-05-28,5501515,Aleana,"My grandchildren loved the TreeHouse!-as did we.
We live in the Columbia City neighborhood and our family reunion overflowed our home.  The TreeHouse was a wonderful ""extension"".
One branch of the family stayed there and it was perfect.
Well equipped, very convenient for us and with access to so many places and modes of transportation.
Jay was very prompt and clear with communication and that gets a high rating.    
We will definitely recommend the Treehouse and our family will use it again, when our main house bulges with visiting relatives.
Thanks very much Jay and Coleen and Mica and Gigi(too).
Aleana"
491958,5080126,2013-06-11,5085442,Amrit,"I LOVED my stay at Jay's tree house. It was so close to Seward Park, blocks away from light rail and some of the best cafe's, and restaurants. It's clean, quiet, very blight, and equipped with all the necessities. I would definitely stay here again once my travels bring me back to the NW. Jay is a great host, and I highly recommend his place to anyone :-)

The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and pots and pans and it would be easy to prepare good meals here.  We tend to have a cup of tea and toast in the morning and then join our family for the rest of the day, because they are so close. I can highly recommend this place."
491958,5228239,2013-06-19,3864380,Tiny,"When visiting Seattle, this is a very nice play to stay! Nested in  the treetops is a very quit appartment that is equipped with every thing you need, from pots and pans to bus-schedules. A few streests (with hills) down there are restaurants and the light-rail and bus are close to bring you to down-town Seattle."
491958,5258940,2013-06-21,5854656,Bec,"We had the most wonderful short stay with Jay in his lovely treehouse apartment. 

He greeted our very tired, jetlagged family warmly and extremely kindly organised for his daughters car to take us to the supermarket and farmers market! Jay even bought us freshly roasted and ground coffee for our breakfast! 

The apartment was perfect for our needs (safe for our crawling 9mo and the two beds were extremely comfortable). The kitchen was well stocked, the shower pressure nice and strong, the linens high quality. 

The shopping strip is just a couple of short blocks away (an easy walk even with kids, though it us up and down hills), complete with Starbucks, bakeries, supermarkets, bars and cute shops. Columbia City really is a great little neighborhood.

We couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable stay; we only wish we could've stated longer!"
491958,5289650,2013-06-23,5227852,Justin,"Our stay at the treehouse apartment in Columbia City made for a quite enjoyable one. As soon as we parked, Jay's wife, Colleen offered us warm greetings. (Jay was away from the house at the time of our arrival). She gave us suggestions on the best food and goings-on in the downtown Columbia City strip. They were always available whenever needed, yet quite respectful of our privacy whenever we were upstairs, enjoying our retreat in the treehouse.

The apartment possesses an open layout with high ceilings which gave the treehouse quite a spacious feel. It became clear quite early on that two very skilled architects involved themselves in the construction and design of the apartment  I also fancied the wood flooring in its bedroom, the modernity of its appliances and the wide selection of channels available via television.

I would recommend Jay and the treehouse apartment to anyone visiting Seattle, especially the southern neighborhoods of Seattle (including downtown and the Capitol Hill area)."
491958,5340203,2013-06-25,315572,Matthew,The Treehouse is a wonderful place to stay -- A great space and with great hosts.  Will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in Seattle.
491958,5433436,2013-06-30,6400491,Detlev,"Es ist sehr nett an einem groÃen Baum mit einer schattigen Terrasse,
Gut um nach dem Sihht-aseeing zu erholen.
Die Vermieter sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit!!
Das Haus ist auÃerhalb in einer sehr ruhigen Gegend. Mit dem Auto sehr gut zu errreichen und zu parken. Um mit dem Bus/StraÃenbahn in die Stadt zu faheren muÃ man aber erst 15 Minuten gehen.
Die Wohnung ist fÃ¼r 2 Personen super, fÃ¼r 3 machbar fÃ¼r 4 Personen aber ein weig klein.
Insgsamt:Sehr empfehlenswert."
491958,5577492,2013-07-07,1771317,Ian,"This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay and explore Seattle. We would definitely stay here again.

The location is quiet and convenient. It was lovely to have a kitchen to prepare coffee and breakfast in the morning. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, and it really felt like waking up in a tree house. "
491958,5979962,2013-07-25,1552491,Elizabeth,This was my second stay here and I look forward to the next one.  Jay and Colleen are extremely nice.  The apartment is very well set up for any length stay.
491958,6024459,2013-07-27,6101128,Amber,"The Treehouse is a great place to be for a Seattle stay. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. Jay (and Gigi) were both very hospitable, the place was super clean and the bed ultra comfortable. Very safe area, easy walk to the train station and a parking space!"
491958,6340481,2013-08-09,1537596,Mark,"We had a great stay at the Treehouse accommodation. We really enjoyed stay and Jay's warm and flexible hospitality.We will definitely recommend this accommodation to family and friends.
"
491958,6752497,2013-08-24,912782,Polly,Jay's treehouse is a good base for us to check out what the Eastside (Bellevue area) can offer. His place is cozy and comfortable. I appreciate his thoughtfulness to all the details.
491958,6804330,2013-08-26,5762417,Linda,We started our US road trip at the Colombia city  treehouse. A very nice place and Jay is the perfect host. Very friendly and helpful. The treehouse  is a short walk from restaurants and to the train to the airport and downtown Seattle. We will definitely stay at the treehouse again if we return to Seattle. Thanks Jay for a perfect start on our holiday.
491958,6875339,2013-08-28,379985,Kimberly,"The treehouse apartment was a perfect AirBnB experience!  It was so clean and comfortable, exactly what we needed after a weekend of camping in the North Cascades for our friend's wedding.  Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful apartment, we had a great time!"
491958,6981152,2013-09-02,1853769,Gill,"We very much enjoyed our stay in this lovely little flat, just right for two people. It's in a very pretty, quiet location, surrounded by trees. It's a 15-20 minute (rather hilly!) walk to Columbia City where there are shops and restaurants and a must-visit bakery. From Columbia City you can get a tram right into the middle of Seattle. Jay was a very welcoming and most helpful host, and not at all phased by us being 3 hours late due to delays at the border."
491958,7193583,2013-09-10,7229825,Victoria,"Didn't get to meet Jay on our visit, but his wife was kind enough to pick us up from the Link station when we got turned around trying to make our way to the apartment on foot. Very walkable location if you aren't afraid of a few hills, and the apartment itself was lovely. Would recommend staying here if you are looking to come home to some peace and quiet after the bustle of downtown Seattle. Stop by the local Columbia City Bakery and Espresso Bar if you stay here!"
491958,7274412,2013-09-14,7244224,Guilherme Debora,"Really nice apartment and friendly host and family. A little far from the city center as expected, but a very nice calm neighborhood; we had the best sleep in ages. Thanks Jay. Great place to stay in Seattle."
491958,7487274,2013-09-22,4124968,Irina And Pavel,"Very comfortable, very clean and cozy with beatiful tree near the entrance! One of the best places I've ever stayed before. 

Thank you very much, Jay for everything! Our next stay in Seattle will be in your appartments :)"
491958,7578804,2013-09-25,7823172,James,Great accommodations! Very comfortable for the two of us and was very clean and well maintained.  Will definitely stay there again.
491958,7645378,2013-09-28,8093172,Elaine,We enjoyed our stay at Jay's apartment.  It was very quiet and peaceful.  Parking was a problem one night.
491958,7769915,2013-10-02,6660250,Amy,"Jays treehouse in Columbia City was our first experience with airbnb. The treehouse is a spacious, clean and adorable alternative to a hotel. The coffee (Empire!) , bars (Lottie's!) restaurants and bakery nearby are all great! I was nervous about feeling ""awkward"" staying at someone's house but it couldn't be farther from that. The treehouse is very private. This location is very convenient to downtown and Capital Hill (so cute!!!); about 15 minutes. 
I would definitely stay with Jay again."
491958,8079437,2013-10-15,7615710,Melissa,"The apartment was great - clean, spacious for a small apartment, wonderful sunset views, quiet, peaceful location and gracious hosts. Jay offered to pick me up at the light rail when I arrived in Seattle (my son picked me up so didn't need the ride but it would have been most appreciated!)  The apartment really is as advertised - a lovely oasis in a busy city, but close enough to walk to the bus stop and local shops.  I will definitely return to the treehouse when I am back in Seattle."
491958,8256737,2013-10-22,8855175,Dale,"The Treehouse in Columbia City is a lovely place to stay.  Our hosts were helpful, cheerful, and fun.  The apartment is such a nice space:  lots of light, an open design, well appointed and stocked, and a comfortable bed.  This met our needs perfectly.  We're keeping our fingers crossed that The Treehouse will be available the next time we have out of town guests/family visiting.
Thanks Jay!
"
491958,8369543,2013-10-28,8649201,Kate,"Had a wonderful 3-night stay in the Treehouse. Immaculately clean, very comfortable, well-situated to my itinerary, and stocked with all the essentials. Will hopefully stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
491958,8513534,2013-11-03,1777973,Mary,"Jay was fantastic -- our plans changed three or four times in the span of two days, and he rolled with it every time. Thanks again for a great respite from a crazy few days!"
491958,8597576,2013-11-07,8638167,Beth,"Wonderful place - exactly as pictured. Very clean, convenient, and had all the amenities needed for either a weekend or extended stay. Would definitely stay here again."
491958,8977317,2013-11-30,2080932,Steve,"We had a great stay in the treehouse. It was spacious enough for my wife and I, our daughter in her pack-n-play, as well as my mother-in-law out on the futon. It was clean, quiet and peaceful regardless of the fact that it was right near everything.  We will definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. 

Thanks Jay!"
491958,9138595,2013-12-09,1292284,Stew And Nancy,This Apt. was great for our visit to Columbia City and we will return to it in the near future.
491958,9422940,2013-12-28,7606508,Tim,"NIce little apartment in a cool, eclectic neighborhood, walking distance from a great bakery and several restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment was clean, neat, and had everything we needed. Jay and is family were great hosts, and were seemingly and hopefully unbothered by our 7-month-old, who isn't a great sleeper. Would definitely stay here again.
"
491958,9599386,2014-01-03,9913082,Cristina,"Great place to start the year! Loved it at Jay's, very nice family. Very accommodating, and amazingly nice. This place was a wonderful place to stay, even if it was for 2 nights. It almost seemed to good to be true. All the previous comments were on point, so don't you give it a second thought if you are considering your stay here. Would definitely come back here if given
 the second chance. Thank you again Jay!"
491958,10616730,2014-02-28,11103230,Tamara,The Treehouse was very cute and in a quiet neighborhood. It was a great place to come and unwind after a day exploring the city. I would stay there again.
491958,10724611,2014-03-04,12095949,Elise,The apartment is lovely in a great part of town. It's a bit off the beaten path so if you want to say you've been to a neighborhood that tourists don't often frequent then this is your best bet.
491958,10911443,2014-03-12,12513524,Ben,"Apartment was great; clean and just like the pictures showed it to be. 
Not too far of a walk from the light rail to downtown Seattle or to the airport. I went downtown Seattle or to the university district at least twice a day during my stay here and it wasn't a problem at all. Really enjoyed my stay at Jays. Definitely recommend it. "
491958,11405492,2014-04-01,12613365,Mara,"We had a wonderful stay. The treehouse apartment was the perfect place for my daughter, her friend, and me while we explored Seattle and visited nearby colleges. Jay was a great host and we loved Columbia City. It was an easy walk to a fantastic bakery and many great restaurants as well as public transportation. I would definitely stay here next time I'm in Seattle."
491958,11566375,2014-04-07,2316057,Jen,Jay was lovely and the apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. Lovely to be high above the ground overlooking the grand tree and the park below.
491958,11706041,2014-04-13,5042752,Stacey,"Wonderful little place up in the trees.  Very modern and clean, but with a rustic homey feel.  A very convenient location for day trips to the flight museum, downtown, Pioneer Square, and the stadiums.

Three things we must share... Just north on Raineer Ave., we found Borracchini's Bakery that had super awesome deserts, sandwiches and soup for a great price, and a produce market at 2119 Rainier (can't remember the name) that had unbelievable prices on fruits and vegis.  Finally, Seward Park on Lake Washington is a short distance away and has beautiful views, lots of walking trails, and a great playground for the kids. Thanks for the stay and give Gigi a pet on the head for us."
491958,11868420,2014-04-17,7250774,Shannon,We really liked staying at Jays. The place was clean and quite. The host was gracious and helpful. I would stay here again without hesitation. There was off street parking and queen bed and a queen futon. I an allergic to pets and Jay confirmed that no pets stayed in the apartment.
491958,12111397,2014-04-23,10996199,Irene & Gregory,"It was a lovely time. His apartment was perfect , clean, quiet and near transportation. We didn't rent a car once! We also got alot fitter climbing the hills. Not bad after the first two times. The diners and bars were great. We weren't that far from downtown and many options to get there. The neighborhood is quaint and warm. We really enjoyed it and plan to stay again! Greg & Irene"
491958,12294380,2014-04-28,5341368,Justin,"A great little space in Columbia City, clean and well kept. Within reasonable walking distance to light rail transit station, giving people easy access to DT or airport. "
491958,13944490,2014-06-09,10799812,Elliott,"I stayed at Jay's for an extended period of time, and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. Jay's apartment is clean, comfortable, and has everything you could possibly need.

More importantly, Jay and his family are fantastic hosts. They made sure I was taken care of, and they definitely represent the best of what Airbnb has to offer. 

The location was nice for nightlife too--Columbia City has some really nice bars, restaurants, and coffee shops, and I'll really miss the neighborhood. 

Highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. "
491958,14195129,2014-06-14,15629330,Martin,The treehouse was a very calm and beautyfull accomodation to start our vacation with. We felt very comfortable. Easy acces by train from columbia city to seattle downtown. Anytime again!
491958,14859925,2014-06-28,14531898,Jens,The Treehouse is very very nice and we really enjoyed our stay there. Communication was easy and all things were very well organized. Buses and the metro can be reached within a 10-15 minutes walk. Many thanks to Jay and his family!! 
491958,15211083,2014-07-05,12956725,Kate,Nice and cozy! Would stay again!
491958,15481116,2014-07-10,10807313,Shirley,"We enjoyed our stay with Jay and his family. They were gracious and helpful. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and convenient to the places we needed to be. Everything we needed was there, and the surrounding trees helped to keep it cool on the hot days. The neighborhood was quiet, and the neighbors even stopped the fireworks at a very reasonable hour on the 4th. We would love to stay here again the next time we come to Seattle."
491958,16057102,2014-07-21,13422835,Kathleen,The treehouse was exactly what we needed for our stay in Columbia City. It's very comfortable and Jay and his family took care of us as if we were their guests. We've already booked this location for our next visit.
491958,16287538,2014-07-25,11299800,Peter,"It was a perfect place for the start of our family Westcoast-Trip. location was clean, comfortable, privat and cozy. thanks for the uncomplicated hospitality. The neighbourhood is quiet, the housedog friendly and in short distance you find good groceries and restaurants. It was our first airbnb-Experience in USA and we're complitely happy with it. "
491958,16413773,2014-07-27,16670834,Esther,Jay was great. The place was very cute and comfortable. Loved staying there.
491958,16656299,2014-07-31,6792583,Nataliya,Clean apartment and very nice place to stay. 10 min walk to bus or 15 min walk to air train to downtown. 
491958,17036714,2014-08-06,12518118,Laura,"The listing was more then what we expected. The place was extremely clean and we had everything we needed.. We had enough space for my husband and I and our 2 younger boys. Loved that there were enough hooks in the bathroom to hang all of our towels and lots of closet space for our suitcases. It was great to have a dishwasher too. We felt safe in the neighborhood and if we had any questions we knew Jay, the owner would answer them. Jay always responded to emails and questions in a timely manner. We will definitely stay here again when we get back to Seattle to visit my sister. "
491958,17668028,2014-08-16,563637,Nova,The treehouse was perfect for our stay.   Most of the stay we parked our motorcycles and walked to the trains and shopping.  The location is on a private dead end and the neighborhood was very safe to walk at night.  The treehouse had everything we needed and if it didn't Jay was very accommodating.  
491958,17930510,2014-08-19,15564272,Ken,Meeting Jay and staying at his Treehouse Apartment was a real pleasure. It is in a beautiful neighborhood and is a great little spot to relax. As an extra bonus it is pretty close to the Columbia City light rail station which I took downtown and also used to get to the airport when my stay was done. I'm so glad I found this place. It was just what I was looking for.
491958,18131417,2014-08-22,14566796,Elena,"We had a great time in Seattle. Stayed at Jay's tree house for 3 days in mid-August. Very convinient location, away from busy streets but still close to the center. Beautiful view, fresh air. Apartment was clean, and comfortable. Jay has everything we needed in the kitchen (full kitchen, not kitchennete). There were four of us - two adults and two boys, who shared the futon. Tight but still very comfortable for a family. 
Communication before the stay was quick; Jay met us at the door when we arrived. 
If you want a confortable budget place close to Seattle Downtown, this is it! 
Thank you, Jay!
Elena, Roger and the boys :)"
491958,18464836,2014-08-27,2152726,Meredith,"The treehouse was great - as described - fit our needs perfectly. Jay was away when we got there but correspondence by email was easy, as was access to the apartment."
491958,18935089,2014-09-03,12403567,Jennifer,We had a lovely stay in the Treehouse.  It's in a very peaceful location.  Everything was lovely and clean.
491958,19270108,2014-09-09,18410120,Pryderi,"Jay and his wife run an exemplary Airbnb! The welcome we received was warm and friendly, the neighbourhood is residential and feels very safe with nice restaurants a short 10 minute walk away. The accommodation itself is a self-contained upstairs flat complete with cooking facilities. I would stay here again and again without hesitation."
491958,19419244,2014-09-12,19606599,Candace,Jay is super accommodating and flexible with check-in/out times. The apartment was perfect for my brother and I and it looks exactly how the pictures show it to be.
491958,19595721,2014-09-15,17572261,Becca,"From the moment I was in contact with Jay I knew our trip would be fantastic. The Treehouse was very comfortable and extremely easy to make home. The neighbor hood was perfect, close to the lake and great food and coffee. Everything is walkable and Jay and his family were happy to help us navigate when necessary. All and all the stay really helped to make our trip easy breezy and surely one to remember. "
491958,19745488,2014-09-17,20703578,Charles,"Our stay at the tree house was exactly what we needed. When we arrived, Jay was there to welcome us, even though it was a bit late (we got delayed on the drive). He walked us upstairs to the apartment, which is actually a part of their house which has been sectioned off into a separate suite. The suite is very nice, clean, and has everything you would expect.

The neighborhood was probably the most pleasant surprise. Columbia City is a part of Seattle I had never visited. Clearly, it has just seen a major revitalization. There are several bars and restaurants about a 10-15 minute walk from the house, some of which are downright excellent. In particular, we loved Tutta Bella (a very authentic pizza place) and the Columbia City Ale House. There are also several African restaurants in the area. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. It's a bit out of the way, but the light rail makes it a 15 minute ride to downtown, maybe less. Jay is a great host, available when you need him and out of your way when you want privacy. We were only there a couple of days, but we talked to many people while walking around and did not meet a single unpleasant person. Seriously, not one."
491958,20013972,2014-09-22,6510326,Matthias,"We loved Jay's Treehouse. It's conveniently located in Columbia City, 30 minutes from downtown Seattle (by public transport). The apartment is clean, completely furnished and comes with plenty of space for up to 4 people. Jay was an excellent host, always available to provide local recommendations. "
491958,20277590,2014-09-27,17086973,Leah,"We had a nice stay at Jay's. It was comfortable, clean, quiet, and in a good location. Restaurants and coffee shops were close and it was a quick drive downtown."
491958,21868084,2014-10-26,15689652,Cori,"Jay was so welcoming. I was staying for a whole month and had a large amount of luggage. He kindly offered to pick me up from the light rail station, which is very near the house but would have been tough with a month's worth of bags to wrangle with. He helped orient me to the neighborhood and toured me through the property to acquaint me.
During my stay, Jay was very responsive through phone communication and very accommodating of any needs I had; for example cleaning of linens/towels etc, where to park my bike, etc. The house is also in a very nice neighborhood and even people who lived on the block were very nice when I ran into them."
491958,22104697,2014-10-30,21423386,Bafemi,"Jay was a great host.  I only stayed for a short period, but he was very flexible with my schedule and gave me and my girlfriend a warm welcome.  Everything was clean and there were no major complaints.  

The surrounding neighborhood is absolutely beautiful.  We kept falling in love with every house we saw along the way.  There's also a great view of Lake Washington and the lakefront from this area.  Lots of grand rolling hills and quaint cafes and eateries in this area.

For those who do want to cook in the apartment, just know that the sautÃ© pan available is about 8 inches in diameter, so don't expect to cook a dish that's so large. "
491958,22620104,2014-11-10,22370374,Carol,"We were totally delighted with the  Treehouse.  Jay met us at the door, handed us the keys and left this private getaway to us.  The Treehouse is exceptionally clean, comfortable and quiet.  We especially appreciated the full kitchen that had everything we needed to prepare meals.  The fact that it is nestled in the trees in a neighborhood with big yards removes the experience from the hectic energy of the city, and yet we were a comfortable 10 minute walk from the shops and restaurants of Columbia City.  We hope to return."
491958,22768426,2014-11-14,22615956,Brittni,This space was exactly as pictured and wonderful. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything I needed to cook with. Such a great stay and will definitely be back and recommend to friends visiting the city. 
491958,22930676,2014-11-17,14748906,Jenn,"This was our first experience with Air BnB and it was great! The apartment is in a great location with a ton around it, so the spot is cool. The interior was super cute and simple with everything we needed. We didn't cook or anything, but had the ability. Jay was great. Very easy and laid back. We didn't communicate a ton as it was a straight forward experience (he leaves a binder with things to do, wifi, etc).  Overall it was really good for a simple stay. I didn't realize (and this was probably my bad being a newbie) that this was an apartment above the house. This really wasn't a problem at all, but I did feel like I had that in the back of my mind a bit (in terms of walking loudly or having visitors (my boyfriend's family is in the area). So just something to keep in mind. But honestly, great and simple."
491958,23015053,2014-11-20,15287196,Elizabeth,Our stay was great! We had everything we needed.
491958,23543654,2014-12-04,17239255,Jean,Comfortable clean place in Columbia City. Jay is very responsive & accommodating.  Everything you need is provided. Will definitely be back 
491958,24027582,2014-12-17,20810790,Kristine,"The apartment was exactly what we needed - clean, attractive, well-stocked.  Perfect for a couple.  Jay made it super easy to accomodate our late arrival too.  There are several good restaurants and markets within a few blocks.  And there's a view of Lake Washington from the deck and bedroom.  Will definitely stay again when we're in Seattle."
491958,24458258,2014-12-29,13422835,Kathleen,"We enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse.  Jay and his family are great people and have always made us feel welcome.  We look forward to many visits in the future.

Kathleen and Bob"
491958,24628312,2014-12-31,22552279,Vandana,"The Treehouse was my first Airbnb experience and I enjoyed it thoroughly! We were greeted with the keys to our private apartment fully socked with kitchen items and fresh towels. The tv has cable and the couch is extremely comfy. We had an easy walk to catch the bus to the Seahawks game. Parking was a breeze next to the apartment as well. Staying at the Treehouse was refreshing, as it gave us the peace and tranquility that a hotel simply would not provide. I recommend this specific airbnb to anyone staying in the greater Seattle area! "
491958,25766208,2015-01-25,21264838,Emily,"Next time I'm in Seattle, I will book this adorable little apartment with Jay. The pictures where true to how the place looked. Jay was easy to communicate with and the perfect host. I loved it and highly recommend it!"
491958,26214893,2015-02-07,23111778,Bas,Had a fine stay in the Treehouse. Nice neighbourhood and chill apartment. All was very clean and all things you need for a short stay was present. Thanks Jay for your hospitality.
491958,26320937,2015-02-09,26080170,Sammy,"The treehouse was amazing! It was just as described. It's located in a quiet neighborhood with a bit of a walk to public transit. We had a car to get around and it was easy to find parking on the street. We preferred sleeping on the futon over the bed because it was in front of the TV and was firmer. The small wall heater was able to heat the place quickly. Jay kept the bathroom stocked with fresh towels, the bedroom with extra pillows and blankets, and the kitchen with lots of kitchenware. "
491958,26894128,2015-02-21,27813727,Jenn,"Jay was a great host - very welcoming and helpful. The neighborhood was easy to navigate, quiet but also with good access to restaurants and places of interest. The place was super clean and accommodating - Jay has organized it so that while he is accessible, everything you need to know is right there, including a folder with information to help. The accommodations were very comfortable and the way it is set up allows us to go out and back without feeling intrusive on Jay. This was our first Airbnb experience and we look forward to using it again.  This was way better than a hotel."
491958,26985743,2015-02-23,21772789,Rochelle,Our little family enjoyed a comfortable stay at the Columbia City Treehouse Apartment. The accommodations were true to description. We greatly appreciated the well-stocked kitchen. It made making meals a breeze. Jay and his family were very welcoming. We hope to come back in the summer so we can do more exploring in the neighborhood! 
491958,27355643,2015-03-02,17163539,George,"The place was amazing, I had my parents stay there when they came to visit seattle and they loved it!"
491958,27724031,2015-03-10,20542891,Eileen,"The treehouse was absolutely perfect! Beautiful setting, close to shops and restaurants, and very walkable. I will definitely stay here again in the future. "
491958,28205303,2015-03-20,12633602,Allan,My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse. The space was very clean and the neighborhood felt safe and comfortable. 
491958,28874397,2015-03-31,23007979,Amber,Amazing place. Will come back again
491958,29098778,2015-04-04,26902825,Mary,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at the tree house! The setting was absolutely beautiful, neighborhood was adorable and functional, and the house was stocked with everything we needed! "
491958,30027626,2015-04-16,25016023,John,Jay was awesome! He was very nice and welcoming. Our plans changed due to unexpected circumstances and he was very flexible. The place was very nice and clean. We also loved the town of Columbia city! We would definitely stay there again!
491958,30438712,2015-04-22,23850815,James,"We had a wonderful stay at the tree house! Jay was very accommodating with our odd arrival and departure times. The apartment is located in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood with the perfect amount of privacy. Neighbors were very pleasant and always offered a smile and ""hello"" while walking about. 

The unit was fully equipped with a bedroom, full bath, kitchen, and living area. We highly suggest making use of the kitchen! One night we made steamed mussels from Pikes Place Market (taking precautions to not stink up the place too much). Delicious!

There are also a number of lovely shops and restaurants along Rainier Avenue within a short walk, and downtown Seattle is about 40-50 minutes away via transit. While it was a short hike (~1 mile) from the light rail (and a little less to bus lines), the walk was pleasant and helped to justify the extra latte (or three)! Having a car would probably be helpful, but it's not completely necessary if you don't mind a little walking."
491958,31518838,2015-05-06,29286048,Ken,Our stay at Jay's Tree house Apartment exceeded our expectations!  The apartment was as described and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay for three adults. The location in Columbia City was absolutely perfect and we enjoyed long walks  through the beautiful neighborhood and eating at several of the great restaurants in the charming downtown.  The location was perfect for catching the light rail to all the major Seattle attractions.   Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family!
491958,32741559,2015-05-21,17239255,Jean,"We have stayed at the Columbia City Treehouse Apartment at least 3 times and will definitely be back.  It is always clean, the kitchen is well stocked, the internet is dependable, and the cable has a variety of choices for relaxing in the evening.  We can walk to restaurants, a movie theater, and some shopping.  The bus and light rail are within walking distance to travel into downtown Seattle. The price is very reasonable and Jay is very responsive to your needs.  This is an excellent find in a quiet neighborhood.  I highly recommend this great apartment."
491958,33026290,2015-05-24,32663453,Bryan,This spot was great. We really liked it. I would recommend it. 
491958,33430871,2015-05-28,28454173,David,"The Columbia City Tree House was our first AirBnB and I would say we were spoiled by it. The tree house accommodations were great. The place was what was depicted in the pictures. It was very clean and Jay made it very easy to get in and settled despite our very late arrival.

Jay and his family and friends made the stay that much better and were very helpful and friendly. Locationwise, the treehouse is very easy to get to from Downtown Seattle as well as the airport. Columbia City also has plenty to do, see and eat. The treehouse is a very central location but still far enough that you get nice, quite nights.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
491958,33819420,2015-06-01,16296407,Bernie,"Excellent experience with Jay even though I did not actually have the pleasure of meeting him. We arranged for arrival and keys through SMS and airbnb messaging and we had no problems finding the treehouse or getting settled. 

Everything was as described, the area was very pleasant, and we enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay again the next time we are in Seattle. "
491958,34306798,2015-06-07,19509598,Beth,Very clean and comfortable in a quiet neighbourhood with ample parking. Would definitely  stay here again. 
491958,34692680,2015-06-11,23092013,Bonnie,"Nice family, great mother-in-law suite."
491958,35202133,2015-06-16,28645365,Kevin,"Columbia city is a great suburb of Seatlle. We fell in love with the local spots and enjoyed the neighborhood and all its sights and sounds. The tree house was a cozy spot with plenty of space for 3. It's a bit distant from the city if you do not have a car, but transit was very accessible. Bring your walking shoes and enjoy the neighborhood!"
491958,36499466,2015-06-29,9518439,Betty,"We had a wonderful stay at the Treehouse and Jay was the perfect host.  The location and accommodation was perfect for our 12  night stay.  Close to public transit to get us downtown and walking distance to Columbia City to enjoy restaurants and live music at the Royal Room.  We fully utilized the tree house, enjoyed cooking some meals and sitting on the patio.   "
491958,38095642,2015-07-13,13422835,Kathleen,"We have stayed at the Treehouse several times. As usual, it was clean and comfortable.  Thanks, Jay."
491958,38476096,2015-07-16,25441411,Wendy,My husband and I stayed at Jay's Treehouse for three nights.  It is located on the hillside of Columbia City.  The Treehouse is very clean and well equipped as it is described.  We love sitting on the deck enjoying the breeze and walking around the neighborhood admiring the berry bushes.  We didn't have rental car those three days.  It was quite a hike from Columbia City Light Rail Station to Treehouse with two suitcases or groceries even it is only a mile away.  The bed is very comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay there very much.
491958,39142536,2015-07-21,19690398,Uwe,"Everything was just right  as it was described! We loved Jay's place because it's like a little oasis: a cosy, nice and clean place! We enjoyed the living space including porch and garden! It was just the perfect choice for us.Jay's avery friendly and welcoming host and we thank him and his family for their hospitality!"
491958,40073331,2015-07-28,1698781,Brian,Our stay at the treehouse was wonderful and Jay was a great host.  The lush setting was more like being in the woods than in the city.  Columbia City is a quaint little neighbourhood with reliable transportation links to the airport and downtown.  Be prepared to walk up and down slopes; you may want to cab/drive if you have luggage or heavy shopping bags.
491958,40423558,2015-07-31,20506745,Anders,"The Treehouse in Columbia City, Seattle, was a great experience. Lovely place! We were four of us, two adults and two kids, and the apartment was big enough and has great atmosphere + everything you need. The lovely weather meant that we spent a lot of time on the veranda, playing cards :-)
Columbia City is a nice neighborhood, and we would recommend that everyone tries the brunch at Geraldine's Counter.
Jay and his wife are great hosts, very friendly, quiet, and welcoming. I greatly recommend the place."
491958,40901592,2015-08-03,29448839,Wendy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 2-night stay at the Treehouse! It's a cozy little loft apartment with a stylish contemporary vibe. Super clean and comfortable, and quiet, on a dead-end residential street tucked among tall, leafy shade trees with west-facing windows that let in plenty of sunshine. Yet it's an easy few blocks' walk to the heart of the lively Columbia City district. Seattle is a city of neighborhoods, and this is one of the most interesting, a multi-ethnic enclave filled with diverse eateries, coffee shops, pubs and funky boutiques. Genessee Park on Lake Washington is also a relatively short walk. We enjoyed meeting and chatting the owner, Jay, who was very welcoming and hospitable."
491958,41313058,2015-08-07,28377040,Calvin,"Jay was a great host.  He answered all of our questions quickly and was always available to chat.  Thank you, Jay, for an awesome and fun time in Seattle! "
491958,41917779,2015-08-10,27582230,Janine,"I had a great stay at the treehouse! It was clean, open and relaxing. A great spot. A short walk to the light rail and a great neighbourhood. Would definitely stay here again. Jay was a great and helpful host. Thank you."
491958,43352577,2015-08-19,6465600,Jocelyne,"The treehouse apartment was everything that we expected and more. It's in a quiet and friendly neighborhood and just a short walk away from the Seattle transit which can take you to downtown Seattle. We didn't get to meet Jay and his wife when we arrived, but their apartment was welcome enough, with its abundance of natural light and cozy designâwhich they built themselves! We knew that if we had any problems or questions that the hosts were either in their home or an email away. They had tons of tourist pamphlets that we poured through and used to plan out our itinerary. I always love getting suggestions by locals because they know best. My husband and I had a wonderful time in their treehouse apt. We would quickly recommend it to our friends and family as well as the rest of the airbnb community. Thanks so much! "
491958,44565611,2015-08-27,24344799,Hawa,"The Treehouse listing was as described. Jay was very responsive to all communications. He was also very accommodating and allowed us to check in early because our flight arrived so early in the morning. 

The apartment had everything you would need in the bathroom- spare towels and shampoo, kitchen- pots/pans, cutlery, coffee and hot water, and living area- extra blankets, cable, tour books. The keys were left for us upon our arrival and everything went smoothly. 

As far as getting to the Treehouse it was about a mile from the Link station. It's not a bad walk unless you are toting luggage. The treehouse was the second stop for myself and two friends on a two week vacation so we had quite a bit to carry. Each of us pulled 40-60lbs, plus carry ons, and small backpacks, up a few hills to get to the treehouse. We were sweating by the time we got there. Like I said it's not a bad walk, without all the extras, we did it just fine every other day and a quick cab ride would be possible. 

The only problem was that the description stated ""laundry available upon request"" and we were really counting on doing our laundry but when asked were told there was a laundromat at the Safeway 8 blocks away. "
491958,45055001,2015-08-31,28013395,Megan,"Wow what a stay! Firstly, the treehouse was lovely - clean, comfortable and it has everything we needed to feel at home. The bed was incredibly comfortable too. Columbia city itself was a great neighbourhood, with restaurants and bars just a short walk away. The bus downtown was also very close , and cheap, and we utilised that every day. The best part of our stay, really, was Jay's hospitality. He is truly passionate about his city, and wanted to share his knowledge about it with us - he really went above and beyond, and we would not have seen half the city without his help. Ask him about the tiny coffee shop in Fremont with the amazing pastries! Thanks so much Jay - we couldn't recommend staying with him enough. "
491958,45765521,2015-09-06,21697428,Patricia,Jays place in Columbia City is very convenient to getting around Seattle . Public transportation is easily available whether by light rail or bus.Walking up the hill from the station with luggage could be quite a chore however. The queen bed is super comfortable & the Ikea couch/bed as (website hidden) is very handy & dishwasher was nice! We would definitely recommend staying here & great value!
491958,46717106,2015-09-13,3142977,Sami,The place was really nice and comfortable. Easy car access and had everything we needed. Lovely lake and park along the neighborhood as well. We didn't really get to meet up with the hosts but from our brief encounter they are pretty nice. They had a cute dog as well. 
491958,47342246,2015-09-18,28919685,Emily,"I really enjoyed the stay here, the room was clean and so was the bathroom. The kitchen was nice and the binder of information was very helpful! I am sad that I never got to meet to host but with my busy schedule, I wasn't there for much time. Communication with the host was easy and they got back to me quickly and made me feel very welcome!"
491958,47954480,2015-09-22,355255,Tara,Really lovely place in Col City.  Jay was clear and easy to contact.  Cozy and quiet (except when there's soccer games in the nearby park).  Our group of 2 used the bed in the bedroom and the futon out in the living room for sleeping.  Full kitchen has everything you'd need for any length of stay plus a nice deck out front.  One tiny drawback was lack of comfortable seating options (for watching the television or reading/relaxing).  Other than that - brilliant!  Thanks!
491958,48412209,2015-09-26,42033507,Vinh,We really love the Treehouse in Columbia city. The place looks exactly like the pictures. It's very cozy. We will definitely stay at this place again in the future. We love the drive from the house to Lake Washington!
491958,48871335,2015-09-29,7332745,Bevan,"This apartment was perfect for us! The description was accurate and was what I had expected. The space was small, but had everything we needed. I would stay at this location again in the future."
491958,49459627,2015-10-04,41731009,Chen,Had a perfect stay with Jay's tree house. Everything just lovely really like the house cozy and clean and Jay is so nice definite go backï¼
491958,49885269,2015-10-07,20736542,Melanie,"Jay gave us a warm welcome, he is a very uncomplicated host. The appartement was clean, cozy and perfect for our stay. We  recommend it. Thanks for hosting us!"
491958,50293107,2015-10-11,41775116,Paul,The tree house was a great place to stay in Seattle. The pictures did not do it justice. It was the perfect spot for my wife and I to stay. Jay was the perfect host.
491958,50747224,2015-10-14,34551492,Raquel,Very clean apartment in a quiet neighborhood. I did not really look into where the apartment was in relation to downtown so I found out when I got there it was 20 minute drive or hour taking public transportation to get into downtown. Would probably be a good place for someone planning to stay longer and wanting to be away from the noisy downtown.
491958,51269267,2015-10-19,37498930,Gayle,Host contacted us prior to arrival and made us feel welcome as we anticipated our trip.  He laid out what we could expect upon arrival. 
491958,51645318,2015-10-22,13761636,Katie,"I stayed in the treehouse apartment with 3 of my colleagues. The apartment was a fantastic base for us to explore Seattle. I love Columbia City, and although not central Seattle, a very worthwhile neighborhood to get to know. The shops and restaurants are awesome. The proximity to Seward Park is also ideal. 

The space was perfect and Jay was very responsive and helpful as we settled in. Thanks!"
491958,53458322,2015-11-09,18053473,Paul,Awesome location and very clean apartment.  Great experience!
491958,53885709,2015-11-14,45042092,Anita,"The Treehouse was my first stay with airbnb & I don't ever want to stay in a hotel again!! My husband & I loved the location & the vibe of this great space.  The Treehouse is about 20 minutes from downtown as well as the airport, and close to 2 amazing restaurants: Both Ways CafÃ© where we had an amazing breakfast & The Flying Squirrel where we had dinner 2 nights.  We were out early & back late so we didn't have the opportunity to meet Jay but he was fantastic about communicating with me before our arrival.  I definitely recommend The Treehouse & look forward to returning!"
491958,54313166,2015-11-18,22661781,Danny,Very functional apartment. We enjoyed our stay. Clean and easy experience. 15-20 minute walk to downtown Columbia City and 20 minutes on the light rail into downtown Seattle. 
491958,54704768,2015-11-23,28882611,Bari,"This apartment was perfect for us! The description was accurate and was what I had expected. The space was small, but had everything we needed.  We walked to Rainer St to the Columbia Bakery for coffee and their pastries.  The walk is about 15 mins away from the Treehouse.  The view of Washington lake is amazing. I would stay at this location again in the future."
491958,55421313,2015-12-01,2160040,Ben,Jay is a great host.  He was quick to respond to emails before and during our stay.  We have little kids and Jay was very accommodating.  His place is very clean and in an awesome neighborhood.  Thanks for the hospitality Jay!  
491958,56120269,2015-12-09,19653638,Bea,"Jay was the perfect host, the Treehouse had everything we needed, it was light (as light as rainy Seattle days can be) and cozy and warm.  My husband and I loved the neighborhood (and only 10 blocks from our son's house). It was indeed totally private, up in the trees and so quiet - no traffic noise or street noise.  The kitchen had everything we needed and PCC was very close for groceries, and Walgreen for sundries.  We had a great porch where we could have sat out on a sunny day.  Jay was very accommodating and graciously allowed us to ship a large box of presents and cold weather gear in advance. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the bathroom was great.

We will be returning often and the Treehouse will be our first choice, "
491958,56797084,2015-12-18,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"Michelle and I found Jay's Treehouse to be as described and more.  We were very comfortable in his spacious accommodations.  The view from Jay's upper deck amidst a tall evergreen tree equals any child's (or adult's) dream of a tree house perspective on the world.

We didn't meet Jay face-to-face but had a cordial interaction with him on the telephone when we made an error on our reservation dates.  We will look forward to staying at the Treehouse during future trips to Seattle."
491958,56952497,2015-12-20,41959640,Tara,"The treehouse apartment was perfect! Excellent location. Far enough from downtown for some peace, but close enough to get to the city center in less than 20 minutes! Would stay here again. "

We had a private bathroom and fridge, and the bed is comfortable too. The location is in a nice quiet neighbourhood, that's just a short bus ride to downtown. We highly recommend staying with Yidian and Flora-they are wonderful hosts, and so is their house! 

Their cat is also very friendly!"
7039427,41988531,2015-08-10,37742479,Ashley,I only spent the night but Yidian and Flora were super welcoming and friendly! I really enjoyed staying in their lovely home and the view from the balcony was definitely beautiful.  I would definitely recommend staying with Yidian and Flora. 
7039427,42770606,2015-08-15,32850307,Dominique,"Yidian and Flora are absolutely amazing people!! The space was exactly as described. They really went out of their way to make sure their guests are comfortable. There is a fridge, small coffee maker, and they put out an array of snacks and drinks for their guests to use. If you're staying for a while, they'll let you cook and show you where are the pots and pans are. They really were super hospitable. I enjoyed talking to both of them!! The place is really close to downtown- I made it there in 15 minutes. "
7039427,43679378,2015-08-21,33178349,Rasim,"Yidian and Flora are great hosts. They picked us up from SoDo and gave a ride us on our way back. They were friendly and gave advice on things to do in Seattle.  We had our own private bathroom, it was clean with towels and toiletries. We had our own small fridge, basic kitchen appliances and kitchenware were provided. Argo is a lovely/friendly cat. The balcony has a great view. Neighbourhood was quiet and easily accessible by public transportation. We would stay at their place for the next Seattle trip."
7039427,43874404,2015-08-22,8894629,Luna,"Yidian and Flora are charming and hospitable. They made us feel welcome. The bed was comfy and the location was quiet. It was nice to have clean sea air after coming from smoky Portland. The location was easy for us to get to where we needed to be. There were many small touches such as snacks and toiletries. It was just a quick overnight trip for us, but we did get to visit a little the their lovely cat, too! Thank you! "
7039427,44073568,2015-08-23,41641379,Humberto,Yidian had a beautiful room at a good rate! Both him and his wife are very hospitable and are willing to participate in small talk. They also provide amenities to their guests which is a very thoughtful and nice bonus.

It was really nice to have some time with them and argo (the cat).

I fully recommended this AirBnB!"
7039427,45751698,2015-09-05,3923541,Salomon,We couldn't ask for a better place to stay and a better host! They were extremely kind and considered. Their place is comfortable and you really feel at home! 
7039427,46028813,2015-09-07,42126887,Luke,"Yidian and Flora are fantastic hosts. This was my first experience using AirBnB and I'm afraid it will be the best experience ever! They are a kind, welcoming couple who made the whole weekend feel like a visit with friends. They treated me with the utmost respect, went out of their way to make me feel comfortable, and made me feel truly welcome. Although their home is obviously amazing, my favorite part was chatting. It felt like we had been friends for a long time. 

There home is amazing! It is very spacious, has very nice light, and even has a view of downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. One of my favorite parts about their home is the cat!!!! He is a super nice guy who seems acts like a dog trapped in a cat's body. 

I highly recommend staying here! "
7039427,46298442,2015-09-09,36472627,Nina,"It was my first Airbnb experience and very pleasant. I'm so thankful for staying here for two days with my host, a lovely young couple.

7039427,46789550,2015-09-13,42858290,Michael,"Yidian and Flora were friendly, gracious hosts. They could not have made me feel more welcome in their home. They offered suggestions for things to see in the city and repeatedly asked if I needed anything. Yidian even loaned me a tripod while I was there.
The house was spotless, I had my own bathroom, and a few snacks were provided as well.
I would not hesitate to stay with them again if I happened to be in Seattle."

The apartment is very spacious and clean, with views of both downtown and mountains. Downtown Seattle was a quick drive away, with great views from the West Seattle Bridge."
7039427,47857952,2015-09-21,26246698,Leah,"This was a wonderful place to stay! The hosts were so sweet and kind. They were friendly & welcomed me into their home, providing little amenities (snacks, use of my own fridge, private bathroom w/shampoos etc). I was super comfortable there, slept wonderfully! The location is great--far enough from the bustle of Seattle but easy to access buses to the hub of West Seattle & downtown Seattle. It's close enough to the ferry and airport to make travel pretty simple. Oh, and their cat is awesome! As an east-coast girl traveling to the west coast for the first time, I definitely recommend Yidian & Flora's home as a lovely place to rest in your travels."
7039427,48104915,2015-09-23,29323781,Judy & Anthony,"Yidian and Flora were such amazing hosts; they were very thoughtful and pleasant! They gave us suggestions to the city and were so accommodating. It was also sweet of them to give us a ride closer to downtown when they saw us waiting at the bus stop :) 

The house was clean, spacious, and cozy.  The bed in the bedroom was also extremely comfortable! The bus stop to downtown was only a few mins walk, and the place was just a short drive to the main parts of Seattle. The neighborhood was also very safe with plenty of parking. Great stay!"
7039427,48337660,2015-09-25,41322124,Carla,Yidian is a great host and the room was very cozy!
7039427,48749887,2015-09-28,42924480,Francisco,"This place was perfect. Easy to get to downtown and main locations of Seattle. This place is always booked and you will probably not find a place this nice for the price they ask, so book early. They are a great respectful couple and know a lot about the city. They have a cat that was very friendly and fun to have around. Will defiantly book here when i go back to Seattle. "

7039427,50854792,2015-10-15,43800794,RaeAnn,Yidian and his wife were ABSOLUTELY fantastic.  They were incredibly friendly and accomodating!  I would absolutely recommend staying here!
7039427,50957544,2015-10-16,29619626,Clayton,"Yidian and his wife we welcoming and lively, as were their two cats. The apartment is upstairs, and the bedroom is not next to the bathroom. The bed was super comfortable, and they had drinks set aside for us in a mini fridge. All in all, we had an enjoyable stay and will book with them again when in the area."
7039427,51326062,2015-10-19,25526676,Markus,"Yidian and Flora were very welcoming and helpful, making us feel right at home! They respected our privacy at all times, but were also always available if we needed anything or had questions. Also, they have two very cute cats! House and room were as advertised and their home is located in a quiet neighborhood, that's nonetheless not too far away from the city center (about 10 min by bus), so all in all it was a great experience!"
7039427,51470704,2015-10-20,42617379,Ingrid,"We were very pleased with the welcome and the comfortable accommodation at Yidian's lovely home. Everything was just great and it was really good to have use of the kitchen. Yidian had some snacks available for us, and we had a lovely spacious bedroom as well as a private bathroom."
7039427,51680591,2015-10-22,45935831,Nathan,I enjoyed talking with Yidian and his wife and I felt right at home. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and I had a lot of fun playing with his cat.
7039427,51786964,2015-10-24,4449301,Henry,I wasn't able to meet the host unfortunately. But he was very responsive and helped me nicely for the stay. I also loved the cats greeting me when I visited the house. The house was good as described and the bed was really comfortable. I will definitely stay again if I need to go to Seattle again.
7039427,52013005,2015-10-25,47031978,Jennifer,Very welcoming!
7039427,52174183,2015-10-26,8070862,Steve Donghyun,Yidian and Flora were great hosts. My girlfriend and I stayed for one night at their place and felt very welcome. They showed us around the house when we arrived and the place was very clean and tidy.  
7039427,54990310,2015-11-27,38765533,Marilou,It was great to stay with Yidian and his wife. They were very nice. The bed was very comfortable. All in all we enjoyed our stay.
7039427,55569123,2015-12-02,47039272,XiaoYan,The listing ia pretty accurate. We had a great experience at Yidian's place. The transportation is pretty convenient. 
7039427,55923616,2015-12-07,47604568,Sunflower," My friend and I stayed  in the house for 4 (website hidden) was such a wonderful experience living in Yidian and his wife Flora's house which is exactly same with the the house was tidy and located in a quite and safe neighborhood. Yidian and his wife Flora gave us enough private space to stay in the house, but they were friendly to answer any question we had about traveling in Seattle, also providing brilliant ideas about where to. Also we were available to use their kitchen and they welcomed us with lots of snacks and drinks in the fridge. Nevertheless, Their cat Ergo(silly dog) was so sweet and was a responsible tour guide and receptionist of the house. 
To anyone who wants to have a feel-like-home experience in Seattle we highly recommend this place:)"
7039427,56358189,2015-12-12,35258038,Clincy,"Staying here was a wonderful experience, as the room was clean and kind notes with directions were placed for our late arrival. Food was also left for us during our stay. Only regret is that I wasn't able to meet our kind hosts! Thank you again for hosting us!"
7039427,56728033,2015-12-17,34875377,Shan,Thank you offer us a lovely private room for us with nice price . It is very convenient to downtown. Just ride no. 21 bus to most of main sightseeing places. And you can choose either public transport or by taxi to airport within 40 mins.  
7039427,56818480,2015-12-18,37792115,Youssef,"Everything was great. The house is beautiful, the room is spacious, and the hosts were friendly. Their cat is pretty awesome too!"
7039427,57119354,2015-12-22,45172434,Becca,"Great visit, the house was close to downtown and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Yidian and his wife were lovely, and next time we're in town we'd love to stay there again."
7039427,57244922,2015-12-23,26389820,Lydia,Although we only stayed one night and briefly met Yidian and his wife they were very kind and welcoming. He had placed post notes for directions for everything! We also fell in love with their Siamese cat Ergo! Never been a cat lover but he definitely changed my mind. Very friendly social cat! Thanks Yidian for being such a gracious host! 
6425735,34598181,2015-06-09,33297195,Amy,"Irene was a great host. She provided a ton of info about the neighborhood, great places to eat, how to get to other neighborhoods, etc. The Queen Anne neighborhood felt safe and also had a very nice bakery nearby! The room, bathroom, and other common areas were very clean, and I felt welcome. She also has a very cute dog!"
8067827,51256509,2015-10-18,46516425,Jody,"My house needed plumbing repairs which would make sink and bathroom unusable for a day and a night. Instead of looking for a hotel I went to air bnb and looked for something in my neighborhood that allowed dogs. I found a charming house with amazing views of the lake which my house doesnât have. My older black lab was welcomed by the charming Leela and treated like a queen by her and her mistress. Even though my dog is older she was able to walk the carpeted stairs and enjoy herself in the luscious back yard. The hostess has a gift for arranging things to look aesthetically pleasing and so even though my house was good to come back to, I almost wished it wasnât. The location is peaceful, the amenities are excellent and the inconvienence was turned into a mini vacation. oh and the morning I woke up there happened to have a spectacularly beautiful sun rise I could watch from my nice warm bed."
5289293,27221478,2015-02-28,24135527,Patrick,The apartment felt very clean and new and comfortable... It was a great spot and a very walkable area. Great location if you are visiting the area! I think I was one of the first people staying in the unit and there were some small hiccups but Jen was very quick to  communicate and everything was resolved. I'd definitely recommend this unit and the host!
5289293,28400092,2015-03-23,4939086,David & Greti,"We ended up in Posh urban getteway/Waterfront unit, same buildingâ¦ Great place to stay, in the middle of the middle. Close to Seattleâs attractions, Cruise terminals, Performance Halls, Museums, Good restaurants. The building is new, very modern and practical, with everything you need, gorgeous view from the terrace.  There is a booklet with things to visit by categories and the, on line site address that is very helpful...
I highly recommend this place, you can treat yourself with a glance of Seattle for a couple of days even if you live close by. 
Jen is awesome host, she totally deserves the super host award. She e-mailed us great instructions called back and answered our questions. When you have dear guests you want everything to be perfectâ¦ Jen thank you so much!"
5289293,35198062,2015-06-16,27531762,Brandon,"Jen was a great hostess and very accommodating!  The location is perfect to the Market, downtown, Needle, and waterfront.  The condo was new, clean, and modern.  Would definitely recommend to my friends.  "
5289293,35283036,2015-06-17,2223901,Erica,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5289293,35440111,2015-06-18,33646857,Brian,The apartment was very well located and entry via the automated system coordinated by Jen was perfect. The apartment is a little noisy as it is facing a street that has a fair bit of traffic but I had no trouble sleeping. There was no breakfast supplied but there are many good restaurants very close by. Street parking was not a problem if you are willing to feed the meters up to three or four hours at a time and there are some open lots for. $10 a day. Pike Place market is walking distance. 
5289293,36945587,2015-07-03,29827008,Caleb,Great location for anyone visiting Seattle!!! Great communication very helpful!!!! I would stay again in a heartbeat!!
5289293,37142701,2015-07-05,29793418,Melinda,"The apartment looks even better in real life than it does in the photos! Really cute, well decorated, and clean. The location could not get any better, either! It's only about a block away from the waterfront and Pike Place market. The Netflix, full kitchen, washer and dryer were also appreciated. Jen is very helpful and made checking in and out easy. Would definitely stay here again/recommend it, just a heads up that traffic can be kinda loud (bring earplugs)."
5289293,37448146,2015-07-07,27441396,Donna,"The unit was very tastefully decorated, furniture comfortable, and though we didn't need it, had a full kitchen set (pans, dishes, ...) & full sized fridge (should someone need that). We wished we'd have had more time to enjoy the views from both rooftop patios, which were super cool.

It's in Belltown, which is walking distance from so many of Seattle's attractions (Pikes Market, Space Needle, Chihuly Glass Exhibit, & South Battery Park--where we saw the fireworks on the 4th of July). We didn't rent a car (this visit), and only a couple of times had to get an Uber (don't worry, across town s rather expected.

We would use this unit again for a short or longer stay, since the perks are there."
5289293,37628641,2015-07-08,37403317,Andrew,"Lovely home, very organized and beautiful location"
5289293,37744385,2015-07-10,32389481,Laura,"Great modern apartment located in an excellent area, just a 5-10min walk to Pike Place Market.

The process to get us into the apartment was easy and hassle free. Although we didn't meet Jen she made us feel welcome and kept in contact throughout our stay.

Would highly recommend this apartment to anybody visiting Seattle."
5289293,38204930,2015-07-13,1777703,Lisa,"We spent our wedding night here after getting married in town. The apartment is as pictured and the hostess was responsive but there is a misleading aspect to the place. The reviews for this apartment were mixed with other reviews because both the reviews and the view pictures made it seem as though we would have views of the Ferris wheel and Sound, which is just not true. The view is of the street and of the rather unattractive concrete building that is the Seattle Art Institute. We were kind of looking forward to that other view for our wedding night! Still, the apartment itself is quite nice. "
5289293,38587600,2015-07-17,23336699,Dale,"Our first Airbnb experience was extremely positive. Jen's ""Hollywood Regency"" was right where we needed it to be to explore Seattle's waterfront, fascinating neighborhoods and attractions. The property is urban and that includes traffic noise, a lot during the day, but not a problem at night. The apartment is in a new, colorful residential building that has a roof top deck that affords an incredible view of the waterfront, Mt. Rainer, the Space Needle and we enjoyed wine and spectacular sunsets over distant coastal mountains several evenings of our stay. Initial entry to the building and operation of the elevators (must have your unit key to swipe the elevator controls to go down once up~~friendly ""neighbors"" and observation solved that), and access to the parking garage  were unknown to us upon arrival but we had missed that information in a check-in email from Jen prior to arrival as we were traveling in the mountains and had limited cell connections. Some of that same information was not in the unit's welcoming/instruction manual nor were operating instructions for the TV (a beauty) and wireless printer, both would have been helpful but somewhat intuitive and we rarely had time to watch any TV anyway. Many Seattle homes, as this apartment, don't have air conditioning~~of course, Seattle isn't normally in an intense hot, dry spell as it was during our visit, but the unit's windows opened easily to cool it off in the evening and there were fans to assist that effort. The apartment is small but more than adequate for two, good kitchen appliances-unused by us except for the coffee maker and fridge, and well appointed.  The bedroom had a good closet, the bed was comfortable and the linens clean. Some of the furniture appeared to have been of the cleverly reused category but of good quality and appearance that really fit the unit's modern Hollywood, cosmopolitan look. All in all, if, and when, we return to Seattle for an extended stay, and if this unit were available, we'd try to make it our home away from home, home. Thanks, Jen and Airbnb!"
5289293,38814378,2015-07-19,27375872,Sarah,"Jen was easy to communicate with from the word go...answered the few queries I had once in the property promptly.
The apartment was clean and looked like the pictures. It was a hot weekend and Jen ensured that fans where running to cool down the apartment for our arrival.

While the apartment was on a main road and a little noisy it was walking distance to all the sites which was great. Could have benefited from some blackout curtains to keep the street lights out at night.

Great location and host...would recommend :)"
5289293,39375041,2015-07-23,12730227,Patrick,"I booked this for my in-laws who are tech un-savvy. They really enjoyed their stay, the location and the communication with Jen.

Thank you Jen for helping me keep the in-laws out of my hair!!"
5289293,39671733,2015-07-25,134287,Kelly,"Jen's place is great! Super convenient to walk, have an Uber swing by, grab great food, etc. Her apartment was extremely clean and comfortable. She was flexible and made herself available if necessary. Highly recommend."
5289293,40587222,2015-08-01,12500623,Kate,"The apartment was well furnished and extremely well located. A little squished with four adults and a baby but we knew that going in. If you use the pack and play, you may want to bring your own baby linen as there was none provided when we stayed. Everything felt very clean and new, but none the less, bedding felt necessary. The sofa bed in the living room was actually more like a futon size- and comfort-wise. Plenty of dishes and glassware for four, the dishwasher and provided detergent are a nice touch. This apartment would be amazing for a couple, and the location is unbeatable for all the classic Seattle sights. Will stay again with just my husband for an incredibly comfortable getaway. "
5289293,40754564,2015-08-02,35510796,Katelyn,Jen was awesome and easily able to contact! The new apartment was super nice and clean! It was in a perfect spot to walk to pike place or either walk or taxi to space needle! If I were coming to Seattle again I would stay here! 
5289293,41924222,2015-08-10,27179796,Mark,"Jen is an efficient, professional, and friendly host, and the apartment is modern, clean and fantastic. I truly enjoyed my stay in Seattle and suggest this place highly. "
5289293,42390936,2015-08-13,33784959,Julia,"Jen was very welcoming and gave us everything we could possibly need to make our stay more comfortable; an air mattress and wifi were things that we definitely forgot about, but luckily Jen was much more prepared than we were. 
The place is very clean and had nice decor and was in a great location. "
5289293,42517164,2015-08-14,5601883,Daniel,"This was a very nice apartment in a great location.  Very new and clean. Washer and dryer a big plus, and good wireless.  Also the ability to park in the garage was huge.  

The only problem, which usually will not be one given Seattle's climate, was that it was quite hot while we were there (mid August) and there was no air conditioning.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the apartment is on a busy street, and it was just too loud to leave the windows open at night to cool the place off.  Anytime other than August I'd guess this would be no problem.  

Overall it was a very nice place and I do recommend it. "
5289293,43234342,2015-08-18,35250003,Jene,"A wonderful neighborhood for seeing the sights.  Easy walk to Pike's Market, waterfront and restaurants.  We enjoyed the newness of the building and the apartment!  We also enjoyed using the gym and the common space in the lobby.  The one downside was the street noise (apartment is 3rd floor), which would not have been a problem except for the fact that we needed to have the windows open due to the heat (our stay was in August).  There is no A/C .  There were three of us -- we felt it was adequate room for three people.  Check-in and Check-out were a breeze.  Jen was lovely!"
5289293,44486645,2015-08-26,18400270,Trenton,"Listing was accurate, was a cool place to experience the city. We only stayed for one night and it was perfect. Additionally we got there around 4pm so we only had to pay on street parking for 4 hours and then 2 hours in the morning and right in front of the apartment parking is only $1.00-$1.50 an hour (which is a GREAT price for Seattle parking) We also were able to go out onto the rooftop patios and have an awesome view of the city, we were close enough to sites (Pike Place, Space Needle) and yummy foods (such as Bambinos). We passed a few neighbors and they were all friendly. Apartment itself was very quiet, just street noise which is to be expected in the city. And bed was way comfy! "
5289293,44588051,2015-08-27,23051753,Laura,"We loved our stay at Jen's apartment. The location is great and is less than a 5 minute walk to Pike Place Market. We also really enjoyed her suggestion to visit the nearby World Market Store--something we don't have in Canada and absolutely loved.  Jen met us upon arrival and was very friendly and helpful. She was also prompt with her responses to text messages which we appreciated. 

Thanks, Jen!"
5289293,45695069,2015-09-05,13520201,Rick,"Jen was a terrific host, responding very quickly when I initially contacted her. She couldn't have been more accommodating and flexible when we needed a place to keep our luggage upon our arrival and departure. The condo was spotlessly clean with lots of light and was a very short fifteen minute walk to the Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and lots of wonderful restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops on 1st St. It was great having a full kitchen and laundry, too. This will definitely be my first choice when looking for a place to stay on my next Seattle vacation."
5289293,46568135,2015-09-11,4396675,Alex,beautiful apt and amazing location will be back soon.
5289293,47692019,2015-09-21,6205806,Linda,"We were in Seattle for a wedding at Sculpture Park. The airbnb was located just a few blocks away and offered access to great restaurants, touristy attractions, and shops. Jen was an excellent host. We arrived late friday and had a hard time finding the garage and she responded to my emails/texts quickly. The place was clean and thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed for the weekend. I even left a bag behind and Jen shipped it without any problems. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5289293,48774587,2015-09-28,35638665,Tony,Perfect location to walk to everything! Apt is clean and modern. The unit is conveniently located to Pikes Market Place. I shared the place with girlfriend and we had no complaints. Jen is very attentive and answered all of our questions immediately throughout our stay.
5289293,50730653,2015-10-13,46192438,Illya,The place was great and stocked with simple breakfast items like outmeals and tea. Close walk to downtown Seattle and numerous restaurants and bars. Check-in and -out process was very smooth.

5289293,51865557,2015-10-24,5001084,Pauline,"We made a day-of reservation a few hours before arriving and Jen was extremely responsive, flexible, and easy to communicate with. The apartment is seriously in the best location. It's a few minutes walk to Pike's Place and is soooo close to everything else downtown. We arranged overnight parking in the garage for $25/day for our rental car. The apartment building is luxurious and very secure, even though it's in downtown where there are quite a few transients. The apartment itself is lovely! Well decorated, trendy, and well prepared for guests. Since it's downtown it's extremely noisy with the traffic when the windows are open, but not as bad when the windows are closed. We didn't hear a thing at night since we turned on the provided fan as white noise. The cleaning fee is more expensive than most air bnb places we have stayed, especially for having to take out the trash and do a load of laundry before checking out. Other than that, the stay was amazing, check in and out process was easy, and I highly recommend staying here for the location!"
5289293,52179325,2015-10-26,42078229,Stanley,The apartment is conveniently located and close to restaurants and many must-sees for tourists. The place is clean and modern and fit our group of three comfortably. The building also comes with nice amenities. Jen was extremely helpful before and during our stay. Check-in and -out are easy. 
5289293,52462181,2015-10-29,1606832,Juli,Wow! Jen was an exceptional host. Super easy to get ahold of and helped me get out of a not so great experience quickly. The place is lovely. Close to all the best spots in Belltown which is my favorite part of Seattle. Super comfy bed and gorgeous furnishings. I love good style and this place was incredible. I will stay with Jen again for sure! 
5289293,53035021,2015-11-03,46185796,Avon,"A great place to stay if you ever in Seattle, highly recommended!"
5289293,53557913,2015-11-09,34699639,William,"This AirBnB is beautiful, just as it shows in the pictures. Pikes Market and Belltown restaurants are just a short walk. Jen was very easy to communicate with and made sure that we had all we needed.
Very good experience!"
5289293,55063389,2015-11-27,26657115,Alexis,"Amazing location! We did not realize how close we were going to be to Pike Market Place. Everything we wanted to do was also within walking distance. 

Loved the dÃ©cor and feel of the actual apartment. Jen was very easy to communicate with and made our stay enjoyable. Place was clean and well kept. Bed was also very comfy, which is a plus. Enjoyed our stay very much. "
5289293,55448915,2015-12-01,24502274,Alexander,Very good experience! I definitely enjoyed staying in Jen's place!
7651702,41523026,2015-08-07,40243976,Sally,"The apartment is in a great location, and exactly as pictured.  Shanelle left us food for breakfast and travel toiletries, which was a nice touch because my husband forgot his toothbrush.  Shanelle was easy to communicate with.  I would be happy to stay there again when I return to Seattle.  "
7651702,42604012,2015-08-14,38702508,Godelieve,"The pictures give an accurate impression of this cozy place. The location is top: walking distance to down town and the restaurants in capitol hill. But it is also close to the freeway, which is rather noisy. Shanelle is a perfect host, she is very helpfull and the house is spotless. The breakfast basket and tips for restaurants made us feel very welcome."
7651702,43138663,2015-08-17,21780962,Lindsey,"We loved this place. My boyfriend and I stayed here for our first trip to Seattle over a long weekend and couldn't have picked a better spot. The lake window view was a wonderful touch. Capital hill was a great location and walking distance to downtown. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone , clean and comfortable. "
7651702,45136652,2015-08-31,1168950,Katie,"My husband and I stayed for a few days while in town for a convention. The location was great, easy walk downhill to the Washington State Convention Center, Pike Place and downtown area. Shanelle checked in with us to ensure our stay was comfortable. Overall, nice and easy!"
7651702,46537119,2015-09-11,13672213,Madeleine,It was a great stay after a little backpacking adventure to Gothic Basin. Shanelle is very welcoming and great with communicating. The view from the bed was a plus!
7651702,47604031,2015-09-20,24703559,Andrew,"My stay at Shanelle's was my third, and best, experience with Airbnb.  My girlfriend and I stayed there for a night while we were visiting Seattle, and we were really happy with the apartment's location, size, and tidiness.  Shanelle was a really great and patient host. She even gave us her parking spot when she left recommendations for a hike!! This is an excellent place to stay at if you'll be in the Seattle area. "
7651702,48952884,2015-09-29,6626015,Alex,I had a nice stay in Seattle at the apartment. It's quite close to nice restaurants and bars on Capitol Hill. A compact apartment with lots of light. 
9563749,55293950,2015-11-29,24164977,Jaqueline,We really enjoyed our stay with Daminda. Our room was nice and comfortable and our host was very kind and welcoming. Thank you for your great hospitality.
9563749,56646172,2015-12-15,3457540,Carol,"Nice, quiet room in remodeled upper unit of house, with stylish  black and white theme.  Modest, quiet neighborhood in great location for getting around Seattle. "
7388899,41008892,2015-08-03,39351434,Emily,"Catherine is so sweet! The moment we arrived to the house (which was clean and very well decorated), she seemed genuinely happy to meet us, gave us something to drink and even offered to give us a ride downtown (15mins away) as she knew we'd be out drinking. The next morning she made us her famous home made waffles and they were delicious. We only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed longer!"
7388899,42008277,2015-08-10,38513826,Ethan,"Catherine's home was a great option for myself and my friend while visiting Seattle. The location was good, twin beds nice to have, and both Catherines are very friendly and helpful. I hope to see them again next time I visit Seattle!"
7388899,42638915,2015-08-14,41152143,Sabine,"Staying with Catherine was our very first Airbnb experience. We had no idea what to expect. The house is located close to the 'Ale House' in Columbia city where we had great food and beer before heading to our night's lodging. When we pulled up to the house Catherine was out on the street looking for us. It was a very warm welcome! We chatted for a while before we settled in to our room. Our room was very clean and the beds super comfortable. It was a very positive experience and I highly recommend staying with Catherine :)
"
7388899,43399735,2015-08-19,19857202,Adam And Catie,"Catherine was so welcoming and kind! She made our stay in Seattle very special. The property has been decorated beautifully and our room had a nice fan that kept cool, fresh air moving all night. Thank you again for everything, Catherine!  p.s. To be on the safe side, arrive well before nightfall. The neighbourhood is fine (we met lots of lovely people) but not a great place to walk around after dark. On the plus side, the 106 bus runs directly from downtown to right across from Catherine's house, which is great."
7388899,43719421,2015-08-21,40705781,Dannika,Great host & great house. Clean & beautiful living space with friendly people. 
7388899,44016935,2015-08-23,40814586,Kun,"I feel well welcomed by the host all the time during the staying. And the room, including public area was pretty neat. The location is pretty close to I-5 High Way and the airport. I think it is a good option to stay at Catherine's place without too much budget."
7388899,44217067,2015-08-24,41253969,Robert,This was my first airbnb experience and Catherine did an awesome job in ensuring I enjoyed my stay. The individual who stayed in my room the night before checked out early and Catherine emailed me to let me know that I could check in early - which worked out well since my flight landed early. Her house is very welcoming and warming - she even gave me a glass of her kool-aid which was delicious and I have tried a lot of kool-aid. The room and house were clean and nice. I definitely will be staying here again next time I am visiting Seattle.  
7388899,45277525,2015-09-01,35850187,Matthew,"Our stay in Seattle was amazing.

The host was very warm and welcoming and very friendly, there was a permanent resident living in the house. We spent many a good hour chatting to them when we they were about. The host made regular visits to the house and we did have some very nice chats. Lead to a nice feeling and welcoming presence.

The house was very nice, layout was good, and was easy enough to get to. The suburb was just like any suburb back home in Australia. There was a bus stop to Downtown Seattle a few metres from the house, which made it easier.

I would recommend anyone this house, and host, if I ever visit Seattle again, this is where I will choose to stay."
7388899,45523482,2015-09-03,19351088,David,"THE BREAKFAST!

Our stay was great, cute little home outside of the hustle and bustle was comfortable. We avoided the heavy Seattle traffic by taking Rainier into town. The bedroom is comfortable and the innkeeper is super nice. 

Catherine is a great host, so nice, cheerful and a great cook! She made us fried pancakes with eggs, potatoes, grits and fruit, mmmmmMMMMMmmmm. "
7388899,45725209,2015-09-05,1741264,Stacy,Both Catherines were very accommodating and friendly. Catherine showed us around the place and to our room and gave us a wonderful recommendation on dinner options nearby. I would stay here again!
7388899,46500907,2015-09-11,6607094,Diana,"Catherine is so great host,she had everything ready when we arrived to her house. she is very kind and she helped us a lot. The house is what we expected warm, clean and comfy. We really enjoyed a lot staying in her house, thank you so much for your hospitality. Catherine  ! p.s thanks for your kool-aid and the hot dog were very tasty. Definitely, it is a really nice place to stay in Seattle.

7388899,50418388,2015-10-11,10253377,Anna,"We had a great stay at Catherine's place. We arrived in the evening when catherine was out but there was a number to call and we got into the house with no problem. The house was clean and as described. Catherine came to see us in the morning as we had got back late the previous night, to make sure she caught us before we left. We were offered breakfast but declined as we were running out but there was some cake left out for us all the same!

There were some other air bnb-ers staying so we were sharing the bathroom but that was no problem.

For a comfortable, easy stay in Seattle I would recommend Catherine's place. Thank you!"
7388899,51415670,2015-10-19,24400123,Cynthia,"Catharine was a wonderful host. She doesn't live on site but is readily available.  The house is very quite and Catharine came by and us a delicious breakfast! She also allowed us to store some of our groceries in the fridge and freezer during a stay. 

Just a side note, there is no TV or a hair dryer but there is wireless internet. The bus stop is just down the hill from the house near the Safeway (grocery store) and takes roughly 25-30 min to get to Pike Place Market/downtown area. Uber and Lyft are both in the area and will run you $40-$50 one way. "
1071843,4441757,2013-05-05,6223862,Ned,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The newly refurbished apartment is clean, spacious, light and convenient to the bus lines, a great grocery store, and an amazing Mexican restaurant.

The host, who lives in the same building, was quick to respond to our questions, and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  We would absolutely stay here again."
1071843,4719589,2013-05-21,6351314,Veronica,"We stayed in Serina's condo for 4 nights. It was perfect! We were so close to the space needle and all of the shops, restaurants and bars that are in Lower Queen Anne. We were able to walk around the space needle and the museums by there and take the monorail right into pike's place! The condo is clean and the bed is soooo comfortable. Serina even lent us a wok and a rice cooker because we like to cook. Great experience."
1071843,5072220,2013-06-10,574713,Paul,"Serina is a fantastic host. I've stayed in two different units, and everything's been excellent!"
1071843,5153331,2013-06-15,574713,Paul,"I've stayed at one of Serina's two listings three times now, and every time it's been fantastic! She's an excellent host."
1071843,5475017,2013-07-01,3479776,Joe,"Serina was great.  She met me at her apartment when I finally arrived.  The place was much more spacious then I thought.  The bedroom has an awesome view of the Spaceneedle.  It was ideally located and she helped point out bus stops and recommended a few places to check out.

I would stay there again. Hopefully not during the hottest time of the year."
1071843,5528325,2013-07-04,5062998,Nicola,"Serina was lovely and we really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The apartment was in a great area, and it was really easy to get around. She was very attentive, and everything we needed was ready when we arrived - even pastries for breakfast! - and it felt like a home away from home. "
