4118282,43468841,2015-08-19,14209482,Colleen,Spacious town home with very responsive and attuned hosts!  We stayed here last minute after a home emergency displaced us.  Close to everything wonderful Ballard has to offer!
4118282,44078912,2015-08-23,11756914,Anna,"Julien was a superb host! He was always very responsive and considerate with us. The house itself was very big and nice, specially the bathroom which is beautiful! Situation is also centroc, in a famous area of Seattle. One thing we found is that there was not a lot of kitchen cutlery given that we were 5 and it was a bit noisy at night. In any case, we enjoyef it and would recommend this place to others. Thank you for everything, Julien!"
4118282,44668622,2015-08-28,32679843,Cathy,"Wonderful accomodations! Lovely place, excellent beds. Quiet despite being on a busy strert. Host was very responsive. Would definitely stay here agsin!"
4118282,45278632,2015-09-01,39291499,Ashley,Julien was very accommodating from the time I made the reservation.  Willing to let us check in an hour early and quickly available for any questions we had beforehand.  The house manual was very handy and had lots of great info.  Their place was very clean and exactly as the listing stated.  I would definitely stay here again! 
4118282,45451633,2015-09-02,21336946,Bret,"Wow!!! Julien is everything you want in an airbnb host! The communication was perfect! Upon booking the listing Julien sent a pdf answering every possible question one might have about the space and the surrounding area!! 
The space itself was beautiful and modern. Don't think twice about staying here!!! Book it now!"
4118282,45750151,2015-09-05,8652944,Virginia,"Julien was very helpful, the home was clean and quiet, and we had a lovely stay."
4118282,46197684,2015-09-08,40561683,Nick,"Julien was the perfect host! Super helpful with a manual to the house, and plenty of communication.  Julien or Natalie were always easy to contact.  The house was clean and very welcoming.  Overall a great stay!!"
4118282,47090801,2015-09-15,40654713,Nancy,Julien was very welcoming and let us know that he was available if any problems should arise.
4118282,47579537,2015-09-20,44186404,Steven,"Julien was a communicative, gracious, and discreet host, and his house is AMAZING. The bathroom alone makes this location worth it, with nice heated floor, dual-head shower, and heated towel rack. The bedrooms were tastefully and comfortably furnished, and the roomy kitchen was fully stocked. The washer and dryer are a final nice touch.

The location's also excellent--really close to a bus stop, down the street from delicious coffee and bakeries, but still in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood.

I honestly don't know why he doesn't charge more, because hotels at equivalent prices were put to shame. For our first AirBnB experience, I don't think we could have done any better!"
4118282,48009532,2015-09-22,32596615,Hsinwen,This was a lovely place to stay! We love the bathroom with heated floor and the giant shower with rain shower head. Julien’s place was very clean and everything was as described in the listing. We enjoyed our stay! 
4118282,48750744,2015-09-28,42957343,Max,Everything went smoothly!  Julien was very thorough with the instructions and access was easy.  It is a great space located close to lots of cool spots in Ballard.  Right on the bus line to downtown as well.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!  He even mailed some items we inadvertently left behind back to us.  Wonderful host.  
4118282,49033492,2015-09-30,11862141,Kelly,"The home was beautiful and well kept up, and Julien was a very gracious and accommodating host. He was kind enough to let us drop off our bags when an unexpected issue came up with our trip. There were thorough instructions provided for everything, which was also greatly appreciated."
4118282,49273951,2015-10-02,32999199,Gaby,"The description for the town home was spot on. It was a great size and really clean. The area was perfect for what our plans were. The shower was super cool, and I must admit I LOVED the heated floors! The only part that was tricky and we had to keep referring back to the manual for was the front door locking & unlocking. Took us some time to figure it out. "
4118282,49933511,2015-10-07,33085889,Shannon,"The townhouse was impecably clean and everything we needed was there! Loved the extra large european shower, this made up for not having a bathtub!
The neighborhood is one of the best in Seattle, with ALL amenities walking distance. Our comute to Bell Harbor Peir was a hop skip and a jump, really easy to get downtown also."
4118282,50584412,2015-10-12,25512303,Margaret,This home worked perfectly for our weekend in Seattle!  We loved the area (Ballard).  There were lots of great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  It was also very easy to drive to downtown Seattle.  Home was very clean and has a great remodeled bathroom.  Parking was not a problem.  Would definitely recommend!
4118282,50986148,2015-10-16,46236793,Henke,"Great place! Clean, fresh, roomy and it got everything you need. Comfortable queen size beds and fresh toilets. And close to the center of Ballard where you have nice restaurants and shops everywhere. "
4118282,51310877,2015-10-19,36619,Erin,The house manual was really detailed; that was really welcoming because it was easy to get up to speed on the various aspects of the house. We had a great stay. The size was perfect for us. Julien checked in with us to make sure everything was okay. I appreciated his concern for our stay. 
4118282,52259983,2015-10-27,8962739,Melanie,"Julien and Natalie were extremely kind hosts!  I never met them, but felt comfortable letting them know if I needed anything.  It's also obvious that they know the AirBnb system well.  There was a helpful guidebook on the coffee table (which was emailed as well) that answered any questions I might have.  I wish all AirBnb's did this!  

Yes, the front door has a ""system"" to it (it's a Mortise lock) - but the guidebook clearly explains how it works, so be sure to give yourself a good 5 minutes to figure it out.  I had no problem getting the keys out of the lockbox - again, clearly explained in the guidebook.

Now, onto the townhome.  The BATHROOM!  As other guests have pointed out, probably the best room in the house!  The heated floors were a wonderful touch, especially on those cold, overcast Seattle days.  The shower was beautiful, and felt brand new.  

I actually slept in the guest bedroom, because the master bedroom was a bit loud due to the street noise.  It was not a problem; both rooms have direct entrance to the bathroom, and both beds are comfortable.  Was wonderful to have a washer/dryer on the property, since I stayed for an extended period of time.

The downstairs area is very airy and bright, which I love.  Nice big kitchen.  There were a few amenities lacking - wine key, can opener, cookie sheet - but I've made note of this to the hosts, so hopefully these items will be added soon.

The neighborhood felt very safe.  I had to park my rental car rather far away a couple of times around midnight, and felt safe walking back to the townhome by myself.  Note that unless you make it home before 4pm, it's pretty difficult to find a spot right on 24th.  Perhaps this is due to some construction that was occurring on both sides of the street and therefore took away spots.  The trendy part of Ballard is only .6 miles away, so easily walkable.  Very cute area with lots of restaurant/shopping options!

I highly recommend this place.  Thank you Julien and Natalie for making me feel so welcome!"
4118282,52873610,2015-11-02,8491457,Julie,"Julien was a very welcoming and responsive host. My husband and I had arrived exhausted after a tough flight across country (delayed three hours, after arising at 3:15am), and we found Julian's instructions for key access clear and easy to follow.

Initially, there was a small glitch with bedroom heating, which Julien was VERY prompt and courteous in responding to and fixing, and we slept very comfortably after our (unrelated) traveling ordeals! (Thank you for the good bed and comfortable bedding!)

As described, the apartment was very spacious and clean. As a couple, we were using less than half the given the second bedroom.

Thank you, Julien, for your hospitality and responsiveness!"
4118282,53844455,2015-11-13,2907345,Rob,"We enjoyed this townhouse in Ballard. The location was convenient for exploring Seattle. The neighborhood is nice, but parking was sort of tricky most days. Maybe around 40% of the time we were able to park on 24th Street itself there on the same block as the townhouse. The rest of the time we had to find a spot up around the corner, maybe a 3-5 minute walk away. 

The townhouse itself is nice and quite spacious. Nice to have an extra half bath. The kitchen is large but some things were lacking. Only four forks was definitely not going to cut it, so within the first hour I was off to the grocery store to buy some plastic cutlery (some of which we left behind for others after us to use) as well as some basics like sugar (also left some) and pepper that were absent. 

The tv with Netflix was very nice to have, and the beds were comfortable. The street noise in the master bedroom wasn't too big a deal for us because we are used to that at home, but if you aren't used to road noise be aware that it is significant. The smaller back bedroom is quiet though. 

The hosts were out of town so we never met, but Julien was prompt and helpful over email."
4118282,54189483,2015-11-16,1534171,Ryan,This home was was perfect for my family's weekend visit to Seattle. The location was great (near restaurants in Ballard) and the home was clean and well organized. Julien was very helpful and responsive to my questions. I definitely would recommend.
4118282,54636127,2015-11-22,19255830,Craig,"Julien was a great host and was quick to respond with any questions. The condo was as described and was within walking distance to a number of great restaurants. The heated floors in the upstairs bathroom were amazing. Julien also provided a house guidebook that had clear instructions for the property and points of interest in Ballard. Overall, we had an amazing time in Ballard and Julien's property was perfect."
4118282,54762614,2015-11-23,6816390,Jules,Absolutely fantastic stay. Apartment exactly the same as pictures. Very clean and spacious. Julien was quick to respond to questions and very accommodating. Highly recommended.
4118282,55237578,2015-11-29,12371702,Mary,"Lovely apartment in Ballard.  Julien came over to help us out when the front door key wouldn't work and was sorry we had to deal with that inconvenience.  He is very gracious and I'd suggest you meet with him at the beginning of your stay so he can explain the things that aren't straightforward about the apartment--operating the front door lock and the upscale shower.  If you're sensitive to noise (I am; my husband's not) I'd suggest you bring ear plugs and/or a source of ""white noise."" "
4118282,55990033,2015-12-07,14094548,Kevin,"We enjoyed staying at Julien's place in wonderful Ballard WA. The location and size were perfect for our needs. 
Look forward to staying there again someday!
Kevin "
4118282,58099298,2015-12-31,22200052,Alex,Had a great stay at Julien's place. He was very communicative through our stay. The apartment was very spacious and had everything we needed. The downstairs was quite cold though.
4118282,58390805,2016-01-02,6133601,Barzin,Julien's place was perfect for our group. We've been to Seattle many times so the location and apartment itself were exactly what we wanted. Julien was very helpful when there was a small issue with the heating and came by and fixed it right away.
6118359,34335875,2015-06-07,33684485,Joel,"Hannah made us feel totally welcome and reached out to us before we arrived so that all of our needs were met. The house was clean and environmentally friendly. The location in Capitol Hill was perfect for exploring local restaurants, parks, and downtown locations. A fantastic time!"
6118359,34465481,2015-06-08,2918176,Julia,"Hannah + Bec are wonderful, welcoming hosts! Their home is not only in an amazing location, it is also comfortable, beautiful and complete with a porch swing... need I say more?! To be able to enjoy a couple of nights on Capitol Hill with such easy access to local cafes (for amazing coffee in the morning, Joe Bar), restaurants and bars (great late night eats too) was a gift. The rooms are clean, beautifully, yet simply decorated and with a special touch only a home can offer. We enjoyed coming and going to explore Seattle (amazing keypad lock makes it so easy, and no trying to connect to swap keys) and also the deep sleep we had between adventures. Super comfortable beds! (Stayed in one room with my partner while my sister and her partner stayed in another- both comfortable beds!!) 

One night we came back to Bec + Hannah outside with some friends enjoying wine and a sunset. These are the experiences I enjoy most when traveling, having my own time and space to explore and then connecting with local hosts. Isn't that the beauty of booking with Air Bn'B? Felt incredibly safe, happy and comfortable while staying here. Thanks for the rooms! "
6118359,35010472,2015-06-14,4328141,Jason,Excellent hosts and a beautiful location!
6118359,35813002,2015-06-22,12613365,Mara,"Hannah and Bec's place is great. It is a beautiful and comfortable home on a charming and quiet block that is a very short walk from great coffee bars, restaurants, and lots of interesting shops, parks, and fun things to do. We found them to be perfect hosts because they were easygoing, welcoming, and helpful and also gave us plenty of space and privacy. They have the perfect location and I very highly recommend staying with them!"
6118359,36291700,2015-06-27,5480044,Mo,"This was my 1st airBnB experience. It was a really good experience! Unfortunately, I did not get to meet Hannah. Bec was there when I arrived and spoke to her briefly one other time during my stay. Hannah did check in on me via text during my stay to make sure that I had everything that I needed to be comfortable. During my last night, she was kind enough to invite me out with her friends. 

The room is exactly as described. I was SO happy to see that air conditioner. Not only was it unusually hot in Seattle during my stay, but I'm from Michigan. We're used to A/C. I know that is not very common in Seattle. The room was plenty big enough for me. The bed was very comfortable too.

Hannah and Bec have a wonderful home. It is a great location near plenty of bars, restaurants and shops within a short walk. Hannah left a very detailed list of places to visit and information about the area. I am grateful that they opened their home to travelers like myself. "
6118359,36597362,2015-06-29,4407895,Federico,"Hannah was a great host, the location was fantastic and we had a wonderful time in Seattle"
6118359,37723302,2015-07-09,29449906,Laura,"Hannah made us feel extremely welcome and was very accommodating in terms of offering anything we could possibly need for our stay. The room was exactly as described and everything was clean and neat. We only stayed for the one night and were really only there to sleep, but I would certainly feel more than comfortable staying again, even if it were for a few nights the next time. Thanks for being a great host Hannah! "
6118359,37873616,2015-07-11,2103704,Mandy,Beautiful home nestled in a cool part of Seattle. Very quiet and cozy. The hosts were organized and very hospitable.
6118359,38195786,2015-07-13,8789148,Eric,The place was great.  Wonderful neighborhood and adorable house.  Hannah made coming and going very easy. 
6118359,38453555,2015-07-15,3629614,Martin,Beautiful wooden home in tranquil green neighborhood. Walking distance to Broadway street yet very quiet. Room is great. Hannah is very friendly and full of great local info. Would definitely stay there again
6118359,38541480,2015-07-16,146839,Krissie,Hosts were very friendly and warm and provided us with a lot of recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood. Their place was cozy and comfortable. I'd recommend them to a friend. 
6118359,38904741,2015-07-19,428109,John,Hannah was very organized and everything went smoothly. Lovely home in a fantastic neighborhood. An easy and enjoyable stay in Seattle. Highly recommend it. 
6118359,39756544,2015-07-26,32635916,Beatrice,"thank you Hannah & Bec !
Our stay was perfect! although our hosts were absent (in Week end)
Everything was in accordance with the description and little more is the word document.
Very nice neighborhood and well situated to discover Seattle. 
We loved this City ;-) "
6118359,40361237,2015-07-30,37825210,Deborah,"Hannah and Bec were terrific hosts, making us feel welcome to the house and the community.  Their restaurant recommendations couldn't have been better.  Hannah left easy to follow printed instructions about the house, local restaurants and stores, and info on getting places using Uber or public transportation.  The house was clean and charming in a beautiful neighborhood.  I hope to go back one day!
"
6118359,40523294,2015-07-31,11159446,Richard,"Welcoming hosts - comfortable beds - clean house - fantastic location a few blocks from wide food and coffee choices - great home away from home while on road 

Thank you for a great night "
6118359,40958092,2015-08-03,3311608,Steven,"The room was sufficient for a one night stay. Location is excellent, in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood – several blocks away from coffee shops, restaurants, parks, and a mile's walk to downtown. Hannah and Bec put together a very thoughtful and informative guest welcome packet that I took full advantage of. Communication prior to arrival was seamless. "
6118359,41352908,2015-08-07,34058304,Elizabeth,"We had a great couple of days in Seattle. Hannah was a highly responsive host, very willing to answer questions and make us feel at home. We only met briefly after our arrival and before Hannah left on a trip, but in that time we felt most welcome. The house is lovely, everything we could possibly need was available and clearly labelled. Our party consisted of myself, my partner and our 6 year hold son who was particularly taken with the piano! We would recommend the Sunset Room to others. "
6118359,41970675,2015-08-10,7963911,Kieran,"Very easy to communicate with the host, easy in and out access via keypad, awesome location to explore and enjoy Seattle! Thank you again"
6118359,42606591,2015-08-14,26680160,Laura,"This was an amazing place to stay! We were short on time but Hannah and Bec made it quite comfortable.  To be honest it was better than a B&B we stayed at the previous couple nights elsewhere. Clean, awesome house, highly recommend."
6118359,42720416,2015-08-15,25612983,Esteban,"Hannah had everything ready for when we got there, towels, beds, everything. The house was spotless, everything was labeled, there was soap and everything else we needed in the bathroom and kitchen.  The location was perfect, though parking was tough. 

The hosts war very warm and welcoming and made sure we felt at home.

This was my best AirBnb experience. I highly recommend staying here. "
6118359,43046451,2015-08-17,27310511,Hannah,"This was my best airbnb experience so far! The house is so beautiful, the room was super clean, so was the bathroom. We loved the beds, they were super comfortable. The location is perfect. The only difficulty was finding a parking spot, but Hannah was great and let us park in the drive-way, since they didn't need it for the night. Best place, I'd definitely come back if I ever go back to Seattle!"
6118359,45390387,2015-09-02,7834080,Becca,Hannah's place was perfect for our few lovely days in Seattle - cozy room and convenient location. She kept us updated and gave us flashlights and candles when there was a weather-related power outage. l'd recommend this place to anyone! 
6118359,45576912,2015-09-04,2191201,Rachel,We loved staying at Hannah and Bec's place! Their home is beautiful--peaceful and warm--and the room was really comfortable. They even put out a basket full of traveling necessities in case you forgot something! We only got to chat with Hannah for a bit but she was friendly and funny and made us feel so welcome. The neighborhood is great--fabulous coffee shops and restaurants around the corner and especially the amazing Volunteer Park a few blocks away. We've stayed in a lot of Airbnb spots and this is our favorite so far :)
6118359,46151600,2015-09-08,32001739,Claire,"Hannah and Bec's home was beautiful, warm, and welcoming. The neighborhood felt very safe and was walking distance to good coffee, food, and bars. Also, it would be only a short drive to downtown, and walkable if that's not an option. The bed was comfy, which is always a plus. I would definitely recommend this place!"
6118359,47231068,2015-09-16,1015943,Greg,"Great stay.....very enjoyable.  Comfortable room (with a great bed).  The location is very convenient, the house is very nice, clean and well-kept.  Communication was perfect.  And I thoroughly enjoyed sharing a glass of win with Bec and her friend Nick."
6118359,47855661,2015-09-21,13360374,Caroline,"Hannah and Bec were very gracious and friendly hosts. We didn't see them much since we spent most of our weekend wandering around Seattle, but even in my first email interactions, they were incredibly helpful, suggesting a Theo Chocolate tour without even knowing my love of chocolate! Their house is lovely; the beds were really comfortable, including the futon. I was impressed with their welcome packet in the bedroom which listed house rules, as well as great places to eat, things to see and do in the city, and a number of other helpful bits of information like transportation help. Also, they had labeled all of the relevant drawers in the kitchen, which was such a great idea! I would happily stay here again, and I will absolutely be back to Seattle! What an amazing city!!"
6118359,48845997,2015-09-28,45037244,Minsuk,에어비앤비를 처음 이용했어요. 한나와 벡의 숙소에서 묵을수 있었던것은 행운이었습니다. 곳곳에 자세하게 적힌 메모와 아기자기 깨끗하게 꾸며진 인테리어도 좋았고 설명도 잘 되어있었어요. 주차가 걱정이었는데 마침 숙소앞에 바로 자리가 있어 수월하게 주차도 했어요. 정말 편하고 좋은 집. 추천합니다. 한나~ 고마와요^^
6118359,49791470,2015-10-06,15210758,Sreejith,"It was a wonderful stay for me at Hannah's and  Bec's place. First of all, their house is in one of the lovely and quite neighbourhoods in Seattle, Capitol hill! I liked the detailed notes and directions they have provided everywhere and the clean and neat maintenance of the place. Their housekeeping also is very professional with all required items well in stock. They are a cool couple and are very warm and friendly. I appreciate Hannah responding to all my pre check-in queries  timely and personally coming out to welcome me on hearing the sound of my trolley bag as I was struggling to locate the house at night! Overall it's an ideal place for a peaceful stay. Their wide collection of books was a big bonus for me while a co - guest enjoyed playing Bec's guitar while we sipped hot tea on a quiet bight!"
6118359,51576328,2015-10-21,46261546,Maruko,"Hannah&Bec were so nice to us while I and my friend stayed there. Their place was so comfortable, clean and convenient. I would recommend their house to my friends and anyone I know for sure. Anyway, if I have a chance to visit Seattle again I would stay at there again. :)"
6118359,51987297,2015-10-25,46445343,Sarah,"Great cosy house in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. (If you don't mind walking for appr. 30 minutes, it is easy to reach downtown by foot. Otherwise, an Uber costs less than 10 dollars.)
 The bedroom was nice and clean, and the kitchen was very well equipped. Hannah took care of all of our questions and requests - an excellent host. On our last day, Hannah even took me to a nice hike in the mountains across the lake. We enjoyed our stay and can recommend it :-)
"
6118359,52751706,2015-11-01,40835243,Cynthia,"Although we never crossed paths during our short stay we felt welcomed and had a great time staying at Hannah & Bec's. They have a beautiful home and are very thoughtful and accommodating hosts. Everything was as advertised, clean, well stocked and labeled and they made sure all our questions were answered before we arrived. I would recommend staying here as you will be well taken care of and in a prime location for cafes, bars etc. It is close and accessible to many things.

Thanks!"
6118359,53405671,2015-11-08,25398090,Sydney,"We had a great experience in this space. The home was very clean, in a great location and Hannah and Bec provided things like extra toothbrushes, soaps, coffee/tea. The beds were very comfortable and the front porch is a great space to hang on. We loved it!"
6118359,53917591,2015-11-14,48005773,Benjamin,"These 2 are smart and sweet. I felt very welcome there. They made themselves available to any questions, but you can probably find the answers yourself on any of the helpful labels around the house. "
6118359,54652147,2015-11-22,3301111,Retsillacm,"I love the location of Hannah and Bec's house.  Capital Hill and easy to get most places in Seattle.  When I arrived, the room was prepared with towels, a space heater, and instructions on how to get on wifi.  The bed was very comfortable, and the room quiet.  I really enjoyed staying here, and would stay again in the future!  "
6118359,56292934,2015-12-11,50594927,Travis,"These people had the best house I've ever ever stayed at. They were very eco friendly, has great amenities, they worked with us on our things. We were able to keep our belongings downstairs while waiting to get into our other place. Very empathetic, very chill, very great people overall. The best air B&B I've stayed at so far. Thank you guys once again."
6118359,56398495,2015-12-13,30124374,Arnold,The house was amazing and Hanna and Bec were really sweet. Everything was so clean and ordered. Such a pleasant stay. 
6118359,56834563,2015-12-18,51347461,Tinysun,"It's comfortable to take myself in Hannah&Bec' home. You can find everything you need during the traveling. My room is relatively isolated, and it can't be reached by the heater, but no worries, you can find the solution when you enter the room.
Public transportation is pretty convenient in Seattle, so it wouldn't take much effort to reach the house once you follow the google map.
BTW the cookies made by Hannah are wonderful!!!"

3610724,19449857,2014-09-12,6645370,Spencer,"Mariel is awesome! She took me out the first night, which was super cool. The room was super clean, and she provides toiletries, yogurt, and snacks. Great location, great host, definitely worth the stay!"
3610724,19569917,2014-09-14,10284446,Patricia,Perfect spot for what we needed. Very cute and clean. Great acess to Husky  football stadium and the shopping area.  Mariel was accommodating and helpful in giving us directions. We only stayed one night but would definitely use Mariel again!
3610724,20620272,2014-10-02,13896249,Makayla,Great location with a lovely host!
3610724,20799022,2014-10-05,21974853,Julia,Mariel was great! I really enjoyed my time at her home and she had great advice on places to go around the area! Would definitely stay there again ! 
3610724,21176093,2014-10-12,22169654,Kathleen,Mariel was very kind and inviting. It was my first time using airbnb so I was not use to the whole process and was not fully aware of the room lay out. The bed is on the floor and we shared a bathroom with the host since it was in the bedroom. It was a bit chilly the night we stayed. 
3610724,21405329,2014-10-16,13896249,Makayla,I enjoyed my stay and Mariel was a great host.
3610724,21762583,2014-10-23,19934579,Georgia,"Cute place, comfortable and clean. We barely saw Mariel but she seemed nice!"
3610724,21898648,2014-10-26,22093450,直人,we had an awesome stay! The location was good. 
3610724,22242038,2014-11-02,8487909,Qin,I had a great stay at Mariel's place. Really nice and clean. I only got chance to meet Mariel once so basically I had the place to myself. She is such a nice person who loves art and health food. I'd strongly recommend you to choose her place. 
3610724,22538319,2014-11-09,22483623,Marc,"Very good communication with host Mariel - stay went off without a hitch.  Apartment was clean and comfortable.  If you have any event at University of Washington this is in a perfect location.  It is a 5 minute walk to University Village that has great places to eat, shop and drink coffee."
3610724,22737596,2014-11-13,21541946,Kajan,"Mariel's little apartment is really lovely. As soon as I stepped in, I thought it felt very homely! I can't really say much about its location because it was perfect for me personally as I wanted to be around the U District area, but I did go Downtown which was easy enough to get to (and Mariel was super helpful in getting me there). There aren't any issues that I can recall - no issues with noise, or crime etc. Seattle can be quite cold and wet though!

My advice however, especially for overseas travellers such as myself, is to ask Mariel if you're not sure how things in her apartment work.. e.g. I had trouble with the shower when I first got there because I wasn't sure how far to turn the tap - Mariel saved me from having cold showers every night lol.

As for Mariel herself, she is honestly the most welcoming, lovely, accommodating, warm person. She loves to chat, and is very easy to get along with; and really helped me feel welcome and comfortable. She's really quite busy with uni & work commitments, but if you are lucky enough to catch her when she can spend time with you, you'll love her too!

I really enjoyed my stay with Mariel in Seattle, and I'm sure I'll be back one day - and hopefully I'll be able to stay with Mariel again!"
3610724,23437480,2014-12-01,14339724,Julie,Mariel was very welcoming!  Her place is a good location for our family and the  U Village Mall!
3610724,24587619,2014-12-31,22866998,Cecilia,"Loved Mariel's apartment! Very clean and cozy :) right near everything I needed to get to, so it was very convenient! Mariel was a wonderful host, very accomodating."
3610724,25116623,2015-01-06,25315120,Krista,"What a wonderful experience! Mariel is so sweet and thoughtful. She makes a mean cup of tea, and is always will to provide tips and suggestions for your stay. I visited mostly for business, but it was so pleasant to share the space with a friendly, considerate host. Highly recommend!"
3610724,25430319,2015-01-16,2808857,Conny,The reservation was canceled 63 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3610724,25975236,2015-01-31,1900272,Julie,"I stayed at Mariel's place one week while  I was visiting the University. The apartment is nice, warm and I liked the decoration, as in the pictures, 10 min walk from the University. 10min to do grocery shop. Mariel is very welcoming and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay at her place. Everything was perfect! "
3610724,29702521,2015-04-11,30443378,Mary,"Loved this place!! Mariel's place was very clean and cozy, and she was super welcoming and friendly. It was great to have a kitchen and do some cooking. The apartment is also in a great location, easily accessible to the University and to downtown Seattle. Overall, we had a wonderful first visit to Seattle and hope to be back again soon! "
3610724,30167011,2015-04-18,2197193,Megan,"She left us an assortment of foods and gave us all of the important information about the apartment. She was easy to get in touch with. Her apartment was lovely. The neighborhood is very convenient and centrally located. On a Friday night the apartment building and neighborhood was a bit noisy with loud music and noise from gatherings. If you are a light sleeper, at least on some nights, the noise will be less than ideal for good sleep."
3610724,30519239,2015-04-23,7558338,Chris,"Mariel was an excellent host, we only met briefly however she was very friendly and helpful.  Her apartment was exactly as advertised and an ideal location for anyone spending time in the university district.  I would recommend her apartment to others.    "
3610724,31023942,2015-04-30,5108984,Shannon,"Mariel was very friendly and helpful when we first checked in. The apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and comfy. Would stay again!"

3610724,31483881,2015-05-05,20693955,Aneesah,"My partner and had a blast. Mariel, was accommodating and her place is fantastic. "
3610724,32019431,2015-05-12,32693892,Brian,"Mariel was great and provided us with the basic amenities -- the apartment felt very comfortable and safe. The location is a little bit off the beaten path for a visit to Seattle, but we rented a car, so commuting downtown was a breeze (parking was easy). Mariel was reachable via phone and dropped off some supplies that we needed during our stay. "
3610724,32289327,2015-05-16,3539305,Eva Maria,"Mariel was a gentil and lovely host. Communication with her was easy and she gave us a lot of helpful information. her Appartement is  arranged with love and nice  vintage stuff, it is really brightly and you have a fantastic view of green trees. We enjoyed our time at her place, it feels like to be at home. "
3610724,33082774,2015-05-25,23593452,Sheila,"Mariel was a wonderful host. She responded very quickly through messages and texts, and left breakfast staples for us like coffee, tea, and cereal (all adorably arranged, might I add). The neighborhood is among college students, but was very quite. The street was dreamy with overgrown plants and lush trees. 
 
The apartment itself was comfortable and open, with adorable decor and art everywhere. I truly left my stay feeling inspired and refreshed! We cooked a few dinners here too, and Mariel's kitchen was simple and accommodating to that. "
3610724,33604610,2015-05-30,6873968,Lauren,"staying here was totally great. it isn't super close to downtown Seattle, but it's in a cute area. Mariel was a very sweet host. she had plenty of suggestions and was very warm and friendly when we met up with her for the keys. "
3610724,33910449,2015-06-02,30378075,Yuchu,"Mariel is very nice. When we first arrived at the place, we had no idea how to get in. I contacted her via email, then she responded me quickly by calling my phone and gave clear instructions in email. Before the check-out date, she told us how to return the key. The apartment is great, with some snacks and fruits in the kitchen. The apartment looks exactly the same as in the photo, clean and tidy. Mariel has prepared bus routes and seattle tourism on the table. The wifi is provided as well. Wonderful experience here!"
3610724,34151181,2015-06-05,33525565,Allie,"I had a lovely stay at Mariel's apartment—it was charming and comfortable. Mariel provided a few breakfast items and clean towels, both of which were enormously helpful. Waking up in a bright, clean apartment and having tea before a day of touristing was really nice. She was also very accommodating by letting me pick up keys at her work when I got to the university area. The apartment is close to the University of Washington but surprisingly quiet and peaceful."
3610724,34321803,2015-06-07,32987354,Huan,"We had a great time staying at Mariel's apartment. It's located conveniently close to the U of Washington campus, and the neighborhood is very quiet. Mariel was very nice and accomodating to our schedule when it came to checking in. "
3610724,34851763,2015-06-13,29599677,David,"Great location.  We were there for events at the University of Washington.  It was so nice to be able to just leave the car parked at the unit, and walk everywhere we wanted to go.  Very quiet area even though there were a lot of college students.

Mariel was very accommodating.  She met us at 10 AM on our check-in day so we could get the key and park our car.  She was very attentive to making us comfortable.  "
3610724,35008263,2015-06-14,21262827,Megan,"Apartment was in a great location, very close to campus yet still very quiet. Apartment was comfortable and clean."
3610724,35639632,2015-06-21,7290368,Jennifer,Mariel was very nice and generous. In explaining her apartment she was easy going yet detailed enough for me to get the gist of it. 
3610724,36404196,2015-06-28,33613815,Abigail,"Mariel was wonderful! She was so kind and helpful. Was very prompt and easy to get a hold of, and even had snacks and breakfast items for us to have. It was in a great location with free parking, and very easy to get in and out of the city quickly. She was a sweetheart and we really recommend her and her apartment!"
3610724,37057608,2015-07-04,33491639,Albert,"Never being in Seattle before, it felt like the location of the apartment was very convenient to everything. I'm assuming the parking may get a little complicated during non-summer months, but it was fine for us. We always had our own parking spot right in front of the apartment. Seattle was experiencing abnormally high temperatures and that was not a good thing for the apartment. The main windows are facing east and so the sun is directly bringing in heat into the apartment and the circulation isn't great. Ultimately, the place is old but very well kept. There wasn't A/C so if it gets hot, you have to have the windows open at night to be able to sleep. The apartment is pretty spacious and is equipped with a full kitchen, refrigerator, and a full bathroom. The entire space can fit a small family if need be. "
3610724,37486753,2015-07-07,18195031,Rhonda,"The host was great. She was friendly, responded quickly to my questions, and stopped by when I needed help. Thanks for everything, Mariel!"
3610724,38000580,2015-07-12,5697732,Adam,"This place was exactly as described. Cozy place in the heart of the U. Nothing fancy, just cute and clean. Thanks for hosting us Mariel!"
3610724,38136567,2015-07-13,34313581,Charlie,"Mariel was a great host and made sure we were able to find the apartment and left the key where we could get it after check in time. The neighborhood is in the U district of Seattle with houses and apartments set into the hillsides.  We were visiting our sons who live on 21st Ave. and the walk from the apartment led up concrete stairs near a community garden on Ravenna then past some houses cantilevered on the hillside between 22nd Ave and 21st.  The apartment was clean with wood floors and an eastern exposure that let in the sun in the morning.  The kitchen was equipped for any meal you wanted to cook, although we had time only for quick on the fly breakfasts and to brew some tea.  The bed was comfortable with a mattress on the floor just beneath some large windows and traffic noise was not a problem. 
   The entrance to the apartment is at the top of some wooden stairs with some bamboo to screen the door from the road below,  so it has a tucked away feel to it.  Surrounding apartments and neighborhood appear to be well maintained and safe.   We recommend Mariel's apartment for a nice place to regroup and rest after a busy day on the town."
3610724,38600014,2015-07-17,7319307,Angela,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at Mariel's and they were wonderful. Her place is clean, bright and charming. Mariel was very kind and welcoming. Staying at her place made our first trip to Seattle a great success. Can't recommend it enough. "
3610724,39737713,2015-07-26,30103862,Razia,"Mariel was a great host.  Easy checking in and out.  The place was cozy, bright and very clean.  Location is great near UW district.  We stayed 5 nights and overall it was a good experience."
3610724,40773878,2015-08-02,1689647,Christian,"Mariel’s apartment is a great home base for a weekend. It was perfect for our campus-focused outings, and comfortable to come back to in the evening after a long day. "
3610724,41748561,2015-08-09,9690270,Shuai,"The place was nice and clean. We had clean cups & towels to use, iced cucumber water to drink and also some yogurt!

The place is close to university village shopping mall and thus dining isn't a problem.

In a word, Mariel's place is wonderful!"
3610724,42263312,2015-08-12,16980234,Andrew,"Mariel was a friendly, courteous, and helpful host, and her apartment was perfectly located, given our need for proximity to UW.  We could walk to University Village for meals, shopping, etc.  It's also located on a quiet, dead-end street, with plenty of trees and bamboo.  We were comfortable, and enjoyed our stay there very much.
 "
3610724,43239123,2015-08-18,35975819,Sabrina,"Mariel was great! Her apartment is super cozy and in a great part of the U district in Seattle. She was good about answering any questions we had and was super friendly when we got to meet her. Even when we had a mix up about check out time, she was cordial and friendly! "
3610724,43617832,2015-08-21,5347478,Alec And Alice,"Mariel's place was perfect for us.  Great location, easy to park, easy to walk around. I would recommend this place to friends and would definitely stay again. "
3610724,44122790,2015-08-24,16795264,Victoria,"We loved staying at Mariel's! Such a fun little spot in town with lots of fun things to do and eat nearby. The apartment had lots of light with those 2 big windows, which we loved! We felt well taken care of even though we didn't see Mariel. She also let us check in early when we found out we would be arriving early in the morning which was super helpful and sweet!"
3610724,45117256,2015-08-31,39382889,Juan M.,My stay at Mariel's place was very pleasant. Her description of the apartment was very accurate. 
3610724,45588420,2015-09-04,39528223,Ashley,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Mariel's place. It was clean and ready for us to stay there! It was a nice location as we wanted to be near the city, but not downtown. It was quiet, parking was easy and there's a fun mall really close by. We don't like to eat out every meal, so it was nice having all the kitchen utensils there for us to use. Great wifi! We've stayed at a few places with really bad wifi, so this was a plus! Would recommend staying here! "
3610724,45674684,2015-09-05,34222161,Wynne,"Hostess was great, place nice and clean, very quiet."
3610724,46377201,2015-09-10,36547804,Carsten,Mariel's apartment is a cozy place located in a nice neighbourhood. We really enjoyed our stay there. Mariel was very friendly and supported us with helpful tips.
3610724,46592086,2015-09-12,35580872,Rachelle,Cozy and worked well for our commute to the husky game. Got a little rowdy in overhead unit later in the evening but nothing atypical for that part of town. Would stay again based on location. Thanks.
3610724,50276922,2015-10-11,32886640,Lang,"Mariel did a wonderful job of making us feel comfortable and welcome, and went out of her way to make sure our needs were met. The apartment is a very clean and well maintained apartment in an area dominated by student housing, and Mariel has furnished it with a flair that indicates her creative and intellectual interests. The things I thought might be a problem for this location - parking and noise (especially on a Friday or Saturday) turned out to not be much of an issue. I was glad to have this place to come back to while working at the university, and would be happy to stay here again."
3610724,52745422,2015-11-01,8443515,Daniel,Mariel was one of the best hosts I've ever had!  When we met at check in she told me all about good spots for breakfast and coffee in the neighborhood and laid out a bunch of maps and guides with things to do in them.  Plus the pictures in the review don't do the place justice - it's even cozier and cuter in person. 
3610724,53866965,2015-11-13,30167143,Juliana,No issues!
3610724,54357635,2015-11-18,49021199,Isaac,"Thanks for letting me stay at your apartment, Mariel! Had a great experience and everything was exactly as described. I really appreciate you're going out of you way to find me an iron!"

3610724,55155358,2015-11-28,4464346,Jessica,Mariel was a great host! Super easy to get a hold of when I had questions and very accommodating. Her place was perfect for attending an event at UW. 
3610724,55876986,2015-12-06,1915240,Carri,The listing accurate and the apartment was as cute as it looked. Thanks for the snacks. We appreciated your art!

3610724,56271582,2015-12-11,13632009,Andrews,"Mariel's place is perfect for a weekend stay. Great location near UW campus and multiple restaurant/bar areas.

7411863,42763789,2015-08-15,39960822,Marco,"Julian was an excellent host. The place was really perfect for the purpose of my trip. Great location in Seattle, very close to the light rail and convenient for my trips to Downtown Seattle and to Airport!!"
7411863,43142699,2015-08-17,3975422,James,Julian and his wife are awesome hosts.  They made me feel very much at-home and welcome.  The light Rail is within walking distance of the house.  There are a few places to eat within walking distance as well.
7411863,45275143,2015-09-01,38311325,Mark,"Julian and his wife was very welcoming. I stayed there for 15 days and it was very comfortable. Clean sheets, 2 showers to share with the other guests. Body wash and shampoo/conditioner included. Julian was very helpful with directions as well. Right next to the light rail so it's easy to go to the city or airport. Highly recommend. Well worth the price."
7411863,46526685,2015-09-11,39666030,Cheryl,"I had a very enjoyable stay. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  Julian went out of his way to help me, taking pity on me struggling with my suitcases, and driving me to the Amtrak station in the morning.  It was much appreciated!  The location is excellent, with a very short walk from the LINK station to his house. I would definitely stay there again!"
7411863,47690379,2015-09-21,35714014,Josh,This booking was for my Mother. Julian was very nice and the room was great. It worked out perfect because the room was way cheaper then putting my Mom up at a hotel for 10 days and she was close enough to the train/bus line to get downtown by herself! Great people!
7411863,48016226,2015-09-22,41961455,Shuang,the house is so comfortable and they are so kind，friendly. it is lucky for me to meet them.

7411863,49005796,2015-09-30,39296521,Rowena,"I had a great four night stay for an excellent value. Julian and his wife were hospitable and helpful. The room is quite large and I was provided with a cozy heated blanket. There are two and a half bathrooms so I never had to wait to use the shower. The place is easily accessible by light rail (literally a 3 minute walk from Columbia City station) and is about half an hour from the airport and from downtown Seattle. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would consider staying again if I returned."
7411863,49240482,2015-10-02,43106039,E. Susan,"    I got a little turned around trying to find Julian's place It is tucked back off the main street.(I am directionally challenged).  I arrived around 5:30 pm (traffic was an issue, but that's Seattle) )
   Anyway Julian was not home yet. His gracious wife welcomed me and showed me the sleeping space in the laundry room.  She showed me the two shared bath rooms upstairs and the toilet downstairs The description and photo accurate. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The furnace is also in the laundry room and was a little noisy turning on and off during the night. I brought in my bag.  I also gave Jasmine an acorn squash from my garden.
    I needed to leave immediately to meet my brother and his wife for dinner.  When I returned Julian was home and the three of us had a little visit.  We talked about the gyoza/dumplings that Jasmine was making.  She offered to let me try one.  I had to decline because I had just eaten and was full, but they smelled delicious.  We also talked a bit about gardening and plants.
    I explained that I needed to leave early the next  morning to catch the ferry and would be quiet, but that I would return again after my 3 days in Canada. We discussed the timing of my return (It would be a little late) but it was ok. We had good visit the second night I stayed.
  A great place of a basic, reasonably priced, overnight stay in Seattle.
    Overall a positive first experience with airbnb."

Link Public transport very handy."
7411863,50099237,2015-10-09,43469582,Benjamin,"I reall enjoyed the stay in Julains house. He and his wife are very welcoming and make you feel comfortable immediatley. Their house is just 2 or 3 minutes away from the BART station which makes it an ideal starting point. Bed was comfortable and it was quiet druing the night.

Thanks for the stay, i would come back any time!"

7411863,52055734,2015-10-26,41538545,Kelsey,"Nice location, very close to the L train and easy to get downtown. I stayed in room C the bed was very comfortable and very quiet. I enjoyed my stay a lot, I would stay there again. Depending what time of year you go, bring warmer clothes because they do not turn their heat on."
7411863,52290449,2015-10-27,46041292,Mallhory,"Everything was perfect, so clean and organize his house is very close to the Link station, only takes a few minutes to the airport from there. It was a good experience."
7411863,52600745,2015-10-31,510279,Sophia,"The hosts are gracious and considerate, I was very happy with everything. Thankyou kindly"
7411863,53028910,2015-11-03,9965541,Daniel,Julian is a good host and has a beautiful house. The room was comfortable and totally worth the price! Thanks =)
7411863,53338021,2015-11-08,1704184,Roberto,"julian and his wife are very nice, they offer a big house with three restrooms. the neighbourhood is safe and it is just few metrolink stops from downtown.
room was huge and the bed very confortable, just a little bit noisy as next to the laundry room, but i could sleep very well. 
"
7411863,53512324,2015-11-09,46864783,Xou,"I arrived early into town so Julian allowed me to drop off my luggage earlier and then I was able to come back later to check in. I appreciated that a lot! Great location, walking distance from public transportation. Room was simple and was provided enough blankets to keep me warm. This was great for my one night stay!"
7411863,53733456,2015-11-11,34429752,Jesse,"Hosts were very welcoming and accommodating, and this room was a great value! Just so you know what to expect, this spacious room is a converted garage with the tracks still exposed through the drywall. It's not heated, but the electric blanket kept me warm. Shared bathroom with the basic essentials - reminded me a bit of staying at a hostel :-) Also, the hosts don't speak a lot of English, which amplified the feel I might be in another country :-)

All of this was absolutely fine with me, but wanted to explain just so folks staying here know what to expect. Overall, a great value, and very clean."
7411863,53773430,2015-11-12,47629319,Nichole,Very nice place. I felt very safe here and it was clean and comfortable. My host gave me advice on a close by place to eat and was flexible with my schedule. Great first experience for me with Airbnb!
7411863,53958754,2015-11-15,34271387,Estella,"The listing description was accurate, and the neighbourhood was very nice, quiet, walking distance from a supermarket (and to get to it one can enjoy the walk among Columbia City's trees!). Means of transport were easy and cheap. Very easy to get anywhere in the city. The only thing is that the room is a bit noisy due to the heater, but the willingness of the hosts to suggest places to visit and be available for any info and direction compensated. The room was clean and they also provide towels."
7411863,54394181,2015-11-19,47953185,Thomas,"The place is located at a great location, about 5 minutes from the light rail station so easy access to downtown and the airport. The room is in the laundromat but you get your key so privacy isn't an issue.  The one thing to know is that the room is a renovated garage so the insulation isn't that great and it can be cold at night but the host provides a heating blanket so sleeping wasn't a problem. Overall, good place to stay at for the price."
7411863,54981825,2015-11-27,33251985,Nicolas,"The air conditioning in the room was automatic and very cold at all hours of the day, an issue when it was cold to begin with. The location was very close to the train station which was good but the air con problem was a major issue due to noise from it as well. As a host Julian was nice, but for the room this was not the case."
7411863,55567126,2015-12-02,25748528,Rebekah,"Julian's was extremely comfortable. Their house was very close to the LINK train, making getting around easy. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the place, it was practically spotless. The room was a  bit cold but had a heated bed pad that made up for that. I would recommend staying here. Convenient, clean, sweet people, safe and affordable!"
7411863,55702352,2015-12-04,45231520,Khaled,"The house was clean and in a very good location, 2 min walking to the train station, Julian and his wife are friendly. the room is located in the Garage along with the furnace and heater. The sound is loud and continuously turing on/off. The room was really cold and I felt cold air coming throw the walls. They've provided me with an electric sheet and that was helpful. The total price was around 35$ per night with all other fees. I recommended this room if you're not staying for a long time and if you like cold places."
7411863,55786853,2015-12-06,607714,Natnaal,"I wasn't able to make the reservation, but Julian had great communication and instructions throughout the whole process. "
7411863,55904274,2015-12-07,45845816,Enstin,"Julian and his wife were very kind and helpful during my brief stay at their house. She met me at the LINK station- their place is located ideally super close to the station so you can easily get between SeaTac and downtown Seattle. The room was clean and comfortable, and I would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle!"
7411863,56269857,2015-12-11,50232278,Max,"When I arrived, I was moved to room A, so my review cannot reflect room E specifically. However, I can say that overall this was a pleasant place to stay. It is very close to the Link Station so it was extremely convenient. Julian and his wife were accommodating and I had no problems"
7411863,56717278,2015-12-17,34374294,Malorie,"Hosts were kind and friendly. The house is close to the Link, it's really convenient. I spent 3 great days in Julian's house. "
7411863,56917530,2015-12-20,33967157,Diane,Julian and Jasmine were very kind and welcoming hosts. The house was in a very convenient location across the road from a train station to go to the city. They were very accommodating and even include bottled water and let me borrow their umbrella! A++++ listing
7411863,57114562,2015-12-22,19725146,Masaki,"Because of that quiet and good facilities, I slept very well.

Quite close from the station.
It's a few minutes on foot.

I like this town very much.

Thank you Julian, Merry Christmas!"
7411863,58429010,2016-01-02,51941032,Rohith,"It was a spacious room.
Home was clean and charming.
Exactly matched the specifications provided.

Julian was very nice and guided me very well.
New to Seattle and felt homely, safe and secure in this Place.

7915432,55619129,2015-12-03,47279361,Juan,Ben and his wife are good people. They were friendly and gave great advice for navigating the UDistrict part of town. 
5262750,37929543,2015-07-11,23595445,Tracy,"We were honored to be the first-ever guests at Casa de Rex. Rex was very welcoming and did a great job of letting us know about the neighborhood. He took extra special care of us, recognizing that my husband had a job interview the morning after we arrived. He provided some basic breakfast items and told us of local restaurants. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed for a relaxing weekend in the city. The space was inviting and comfortable, with plenty of room. Rex created a warm environment, filled with beautiful art and textiles.
We will definitely visit Casa de Rex in the future. He was a great host and very interested in ensuring our stay was an enjoyable one."
5262750,38348498,2015-07-14,37945262,Chris,"Rex did an amazing job at making both my girlfriend and me feel at home when we visited Seattle.  He was invaluable in helping us decide whether to get a car for our stay (we didn't, and it was the right choice), as well as providing plenty of information about what to do.  The residence was very spacious and had all the comforts of home.  Everything was as pictured/listed, and then some!  We would not hesitate to stay with Rex the next time we visit Seattle."
5262750,39219824,2015-07-21,23465619,Brian,We had a wonderful time staying at Rex's! The apartment was private and a 10 minute drive to downtown. Would definitely stay here again!
5262750,39824421,2015-07-26,2229581,Liam,"We had a wonderful time staying at Rex's place. It was beautiful, comfy and in an amazing location. Rex was incredibly friendly and accomidating to us as well. Would definitely reccommend anyone to stay here. Thanks Rex!"
5262750,40170816,2015-07-28,38690351,Kathleen,"Our host made us feel very welcome.  We looked forward to coming back to our 'home away from home', as compared to an impersonal hotel room.  Very nice space."
5262750,40518207,2015-07-31,39245122,Jodie,"Wonderful rental!! I highly recommend staying in this cottage. Rex is so kind, welcoming and helpful. He left organic coffee, apples, milk and yogurts for us that were terrific after a day of travel. The apartment is spic and span, and very comfortable. The location is phenomenal-- quiet and residential but a hop, skip and a jump from downtown as well as the Seattle center. There are also coffee shops, bars and restaurants within just a few short blocks. All in all this was vastly more enjoyable than a hotel and much less expensive. Thank you Rex!! "
5262750,40963124,2015-08-03,36144784,Rachel,Everything was amazing. Rex was an amazing host and his description of Seclusion in the heart of Seattle was SPOT ON! Totally recommend staying at his place and would do it again. 
5262750,41644965,2015-08-08,10918795,Danielle,"I was warmly welcomed by Rex, we spoke the day prior to my arrival also which was helpful. Rex gave me good directions to find the apartment and also very kindly asked me breakfast preferences. Just a lovely touch. Rex was there to let me into the apartment and to give me a complete guided tour. No detail has been spared, right down to the variety of herbal teas, well stocked fridge and pantry (lovely olive oil etc) and gorgeous garden with private seating. Rex passed on some lovely restaurant recommendations (I tried them all!) which were close by to his home. Rex is a considerate and interesting host, I enjoyed meeting him and his very sweet little dog! I also really loved the area in which the home is located, quiet but close to everything, parking is easy too. I would absolutely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a charming host and a delightful home away from home in Seattle. I hope to return."
5262750,42159871,2015-08-11,35259458,Alex,"It was my first time in Seattle with my family and Rex made it so convenient for us to find our way through the city. This cute side house is super close to downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. It is only about a $7 uber ride away from downtown! Even though Rex's location is so close to everything, it was nothing short of private and cozy. 

Thank you Rex for the amazing stay! We will definitely be back :)"
5262750,42439089,2015-08-13,22507707,Aiko,"Rex was a wonderful host. His lovely in-law apartment was exactly as it appeared in the listing--cozy, quiet, and clean. In addition to meeting us upon arrival to show us around, he gave us so many suggestions of things to do during our short stay in Seattle. We ended up taking most of his recommendations and had a great stay. He even printed maps for us with directions to various attractions. 

We would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood was charming and conveniently located, Rex had the fridge stocked for breakfast, and his little dog was so cute and friendly too. Thanks, Rex!"
5262750,42594758,2015-08-14,9090607,Rafael,"This AirBnB rental is really great! So cozy and warm that can be immediately felt upon arrival. Plus the host is such a nice guy, made me feel welcome right away. The entire rental was very clean and super cute. The entrance to this rental is right next door to the main homes entrance with a little pathway that's covered in colored pebbles, which I thought was super cute. Inside the home, the host had some snacks ready for me when I arrived, which I thought was very considerate. The entire place is very clean and cozy and I think would be great for a weekend getaway. My only regret is not having been able to stay longer in this rental. I would recommend it to anybody looking for a quick getaway"
5262750,43285035,2015-08-18,29300753,Christina,Our experience at Rex was perfect. The house seemed a little boutique. The bedroom was so nice and accurately presented it was a joy to be in there. Also the bathroom furnished with all matching blu and grey towels. Bath salts and amenities if you needed. Rex was a great host. We arrived at 11.30pm and he gave us plenty of suggestions and provide us with fresh fruits. In the morning he also took us to the downtown and lend us some money till we got to change it. It was all great.
5262750,43434645,2015-08-19,36477027,Abigail,"Rex was a wonderful host. He greeted us kindly and offers a welcoming place to stay in Seattle. Recommended some nice spots, we enjoyed our time here, next time we will stay longer. Thanks Rex!"
5262750,44565627,2015-08-27,40327184,Will,Rex and the private suite are awesome. The place is in a really cool neighborhood and walking distance to lot's of cool spots. The place itself is plenty spacious and is very comfortable. Rex was a great host. He went above and beyond to make our stay amazing. Definitely stay here!
5262750,44925566,2015-08-30,9492677,Judd,"Our experience here was above and beyond anything we expected during our stay.  Rex went out of his way to make us feel welcome and give us some great tips on exploring Seattle.  We arrived  late because of a plane delay, and Rex still stayed up to greet us when we arrived.  He supplied us with tea, coffee, milk, and an ample amount of food and snacks for our stay.  A very nice touch.  His knowledge of things to do in Seattle was invaluable.  The apartment felt like a home away from home with a comfy bed, great bathroom, and and full kitchen/living room.  The neighborhood was very walkable with some decent restaurants, and a cool tasting room called Chuck's Hop Shop only 1-2 blocks away with about 50 beers on tap!  Uber rides averaged only $7-8 to downtown."
5262750,45139877,2015-08-31,40536407,Ruth,"Rex was a wonderful and gracious host. He made us feel at home right away and gave us lots of good ideas for things to do in the city. The location was great. We were about a ten minute drive away from everything we wanted to do. The space itself is connected to Rex's house, but has its own bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen and is very private and separate. We really enjoyed our stay and would book again. "
5262750,46282127,2015-09-09,35510638,Rebecca,"What a great stay we had in Seattle. The B&B was very spacious, centrally located and complete with everything we needed! Rex was available (though not intrusive) for any questions and had lots of ideas for us to experience Seattle best. Great to have a full kitchen for breakfasts and lazy vacation mornings. Hope to have the opportunity to return!"
5262750,46523850,2015-09-11,14715271,Linda,"What a wonderful respite that felt like home the moment I arrived. After a long drive to Seattle, I was able to immediately shift from stress to calm. The experience feels like a Buddhist retreat, and invites guests to contemplate and enjoy the quiet. Rex is fabulous, so eager to host, and attend to all the fine details of a comfy visit. He provided several dining options in the neighborhood, parking solutions, ideas for my next visit, a map, and so much more. I loved the Rumi and David Whyte poetry books (personal faves), beautiful ceramic tea cups, and the artful placement of treasures throughout...In the style of a B&B, a cupboard was stocked with gluten free cereal, organic fair trade coffee, herbal tea selections...Rex even offered me cream and fruit for my breakfast. 
People say this all the time on reviews, but I truly wish I could have stayed much longer. I arrived late and left early the next morning for a single-day conference in the city. The memory of my brief experience at Seclusion in the City will draw me back again, and again. "
5262750,55098063,2015-11-28,21381527,Catherine,"Rex went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. He took time to be there when we arrived and show us everything about the apartment.  He had a basket full of information on things to do and places to eat in the area.  The apartment is nicely decorated and had everything we needed, including milk, cereal, and coffee for breakfast.  It is located in a quiet, quaint neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
5262750,57776090,2015-12-29,24664011,Martha,"We enjoyed our stay at Seclusion in the Heart of Seattle.  The unit was quite comfortable, nicely furnished, quiet and convenient to Capital Hill.  "
4111954,23396035,2014-11-30,5855886,Dee,"Teresa was out of town, but her husband Mike was very accommodating. He even called us enroute to let us know that Snoqualmie Pass was closed due to an accident and suggested a place for us to purchase chains for our vehicle. Mike also was very fun to talk to about his travels. Mike helped my spouse work on our daughter's car, which was way beyond the call of duty. The queen-size bed was quite comfortable, and the apartment was located close to coffee shops and restaurants. "
4111954,25263853,2015-01-11,9290231,Cara,"The hosts, Teresa and Mike, were great, especially considering that they were handling the visit remotely, since they were in Peru. They were very responsive via email, and they had deputized a neighbor in the building to help with keys, etc. She was also friendly and very responsive. In fact, one of the great virtues of this stay was the community of neighbors; I also got to know Rula, who runs the restaurant on the corner with her husband, and she was wonderful.

The neighborhood in general, Greenwood/Phinney, is one of Seattle's best neighborhoods: vibrant with a wealth of restaurants and boutiques, eminently walkable.

The apartment itself is comfortable and attractive--quite spacious. I loved all the windows onto the street and did a lot of work at the desk. Overall, I'd highly recommend the experience!"
4111954,25681901,2015-01-23,21500976,Max,"Mike and Teresa were wonderful hosts, even from across the world (they were spending time in Peru while we stayed in their apartment). To start, they were flexible--we changed our check-in date a few times before arrival, and that was no problem. Their neighbor let us into the apartment and gave us the keys--we had no problems at all. The space is big and in a great location, and you can't beat the price. "
4111954,26214467,2015-02-07,25746842,Patience,"My roommate and I really enjoyed staying at this apartment. Mike and Teresa were in Peru during our stay, so we were able to stay in touch via email. We stayed here for two weeks while looking for our own place to rent. It was a great way to get to know the neighborhood, as the apartment is right on a street lined with restaurants and small businesses. There is a Safeway grocery store within walking distance as well. The kitchen was stocked with nice knives and cookware. We cooked almost all of our meals while staying here. Overall the apartment was very cute and welcoming. Prior to arriving we spent a week in the car on our road trip, so the yoga room was amazing for stretching out. There is also a nice desk to work at and a quiet little porch to sit on. The bed was very comfortable and the heated blanket was a great surprise. We would definitely recommend this Air BnB :)"
4111954,46601259,2015-09-12,39397403,Juana,"My mom and I had a very pleasant stay at Teresa's and Mike's place. They have a lovely home and we felt very welcome. During our stay, Mike was in town and staying in the office. And even though it is always nicer to have the place to yourself, Mike was very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable at his place. Other perks: everything is very clean and organized, and the neighborhood is great as you have easy access to plenty of restaurants, beautiful Green Lake, shopping places, and groceries stores. "
4111954,47100089,2015-09-15,43136526,Misha,The house was awesome. My husband and I felt welcomed immediately after our arrival. Mike was in the apartment during our stay. He is a nice guy to talk to. But he also made sure we had lots of privacy. I hardly could tell he was at home. The location of the apartment is very good too as it is on the bus line that goes very often. The neighborhood is very nice as well. I highly recommend you to stay in Mike and Teresa's (website hidden): The bed and pillows are super comfortable. :-)
4111954,48078600,2015-09-23,39397403,Juana,"My mother and I were very happy to have stayed at Teresa's and Mike's place, it was exactly what we were looking for! We felt very welcomed and comfortable during our stay and would recommend anyone to stay at their place!"
4111954,54605889,2015-11-22,44770501,Kameron,Michael and Teresa's Apartment was an Amazing experience. We especially loved the neighborhood and how close it was to pretty much everything. Our host Michael was really cool and had really cool stories about his travels through the Amazon River. Overall a 10 out of 10.
4111954,55293718,2015-11-29,49630942,Gerry,"It is a nice, clean apartment with off street parking. It is on a city bus route, but I did not hear any street noise. Restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores are nearby.

It is well furnished and has fast wireless internet.

I highly recommend it!"
4111954,56178393,2015-12-10,34848263,Ted,"Our host made us most welcome & had help provided during our week's stay.    The neighbourhood is friendly & safe with nearby shops & eateries & bus & taxi at front door.  We would be more than happy to stay here again.     Ted & Ursula Hurley, Dublin, Ireland"
4111954,57997071,2015-12-31,34006124,Kristen,"The apartment was just as advertised.  Spacious,  inviting and had everything yiu might need. Bus stop right in front of the apartment.  Coffee shops,  restaurants,  grocery store and other shops right in the neighborhood.  

The host,  Mike and Teresa were amazing at communication, despite being out of the country.  

Would definitely stay here again. "
8634897,50419874,2015-10-11,45671643,Samantha,"Terri was amazing!  It was my first time on airbnb and i screwed up the booking.  But she was so patient and helpful!!!  She was very responsive and quickly helped me through the hoops.  don't get me (website hidden)'s not difficult I'm sure for the average person, but I left a letter out of my email address and they could not contact me.  anyway, when I discovered the day before that my I had been canceled... she was Johnny on the spot and got it fixed ASAP! Thank you Terri!!"
8634897,51219788,2015-10-18,46027417,Ryan,"Our experience at Terri's house was unbelievable and pictures do not do this beautiful house justice. The house is part of a great neighborhood, with friendly neighbors and is only steps from the beach. Terri is a great host and went above and beyond to make are stay go as smoothly as possible. You can't go wrong with booking this house. "
8634897,51991215,2015-10-25,46601658,Jenny,very nice place and Terri is so helpful! We had a great time
8634897,53404146,2015-11-08,47713969,Carrie,"The house is beautiful and has a gorgeous view.  I thought it was closer to Seattle than it was, but that is my fault for not looking at the address.  It was still close enough to drive into Seattle though.  The house had coffee, tea, and champagne at our disposal, along with some yogurt and eggs in the morning if we needed.  It was a wonderful place to stay and I am glad I chose to stay there."
8634897,54726090,2015-11-23,17555132,Jaime,My family and had a wonderful vacation.  The house was absolutely perfect.  We cooked almost every meal at home and it had everything we needed.  The kitchen was perfect to be able to sit and visit with family and cook at the same time.  Everyone slept well on the comfy beds.  Its one block away from a beautiful beach with tons of seashells.  Terri was quick to respond to any questions that we had.  We are already planning another trip back to Seattle in March and hoping we will be able to stay here again.  
8634897,56404739,2015-12-13,37171398,Jeff,"We had a lovely time and it was perfectly suited to meet our needs. Very close to the airport and half an hour to downtown Seattle but it seemed world away. owners were very accommodating and the house had everything you could want. Large decks, incredible views, cable tv, and outdoor grill. Wonderful for gatherings of friends and family. "
3987838,22417774,2014-11-05,9111267,Thomas,"The Madrona Casita is an experience - one that I would certainly enjoy to have again and again. An immaculate space with professional attention to detail and design - our stay was filled with inspiration on how we would like to design our own home in the future. 

Amanda and Toni were gracious and generous hosts providing us with a number of things to make us feel at home be it tea, chocolate, or various items for which to snack. The neighborhood is quiet and conveniently located with Capitol Hill and Downtown only one bus ride/or a short Uber ride away. 

Though we did not have the chance to connect with Amanda or Toni in person during the stay - they were available and informative every step of the way. I really can't say enough in how much this stay was enjoyed! "
3987838,22665247,2014-11-11,9791684,Troy,"Awesome home with Amazing Hosts!

Clean and beautiful space with basically everything you'd need for your vacation stay; big comfy bed, handy kitchen space (equipt with tea and other goodies), the most comfortable rocking chair to date and heated floors! 

No need to feel cramped because there's plenty of room providing you with enough space to waltz around with your bowl of the greatest homemade granola I've ever tasted. 

Going  downtown was a breeze, our closet stop was a 3-5 minute walk and then a quick maybe 20-30 minute ride. I suggest taking a stroll around the neighborhood anyways because the area is so beautiful. 

My girlfriend and I are naturally shy so we just briefly introduced ourselves to Amanda and Toni, but the two seem to be genuinely pleased to see us enjoying their little slice of life. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone considering."
3987838,22811272,2014-11-15,23231994,Julia,"I would highly recommend staying here! This is a truly special place! The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood but super close to downtown and Capital Hill. The casita is beautifully decorated with an interesting garden outside and a great selection of reading material. Super comfortable bed and nice bedding.  The hosts were welcoming and provided an excellent selection of food including homemade granola! Full kitchen. Beautifully decorated. Easy parking. Staying here was a real treat, we loved it! "

It's the perfect place to get around Seattle, or to hide away from the world. The wood walls and kitchen feel hand made and like you're in a cabin tucked away in the woods. As a solo traveller, Amanda and Toni went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and ensure I had everything I needed and knew how to get around (which is an easy bus to downtown). She even leant me her beautiful guitar to play while I was there. Just two of the most beautiful people you will meet. Cannot recommend highly enough. "
3987838,50508780,2015-10-12,33149420,Helena,"Amanda and Toni were great hosts!! The apartment is great, it is off of their place, but you'd never know you were sharing walls with a house, it was so peaceful. The location is great too, it's in the middle of a lovely neighborhood with a grocery and a few restaurants within walking distance. I also loved the design of this house, they managed to make it both minimalistic and cozy. Everything was clean and ready for our arrival, I really have no complains. The tea selection was my favorite though, those ladies know what they're doing! "
3987838,50778202,2015-10-14,11269719,Emily,We had a great stay at the Madrona Casita. We didn't have any trouble finding parking right outside of the house and the apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Amanda was super sweet and committed to ensuring we had a nice visit. Would definitely recommend for your next visit to Seattle!
3987838,51458846,2015-10-20,27074182,Benjamin,"The casita exceeded our expectations.  Truly a great stay.  Convenient location in a really great neighborhood.  Some great Thai right up the street!  Very clean, and modern but with a comfortable rustic feel.  Loved the wood shelves and heated concrete floors!  Thanks so much for a great stay!"
3987838,51784880,2015-10-24,31364860,Evan,My wife Kelly and her sister had an amazing stay ally Madrona Casita. Amanda and Toni were excellent hosts and were extremely helpful for things to do during their stay. Thank you again for the great hospitality!
3987838,51925519,2015-10-25,11872082,Emily,"This was our most favorite airbnb stay yet! I arrived terribly sick with a bad cold and found this place so healing, and Amanda and Toni so accommodating, that we decided to cancel our other hotel reservation and stay longer than expected!  The place is charming, spotless, with everything you could possibly need and more -- replete with beer in the refrig, chocolates, Seattle coffee, real cream, a list of local restaurants and suggestions for things to do -- and even plush bathrobes to lounge about in and a lovely guitar to play! I'm telling all our friends about our favorite stay! Thank you Amanda and Toni for making us so welcome and comfortable.  We will certainly be back!
"
3987838,54242950,2015-11-17,45012094,Alex,"The place was great!  
Beautifully designed and warm!

3987838,55914088,2015-12-07,1227853,Beth,Amanda responded quickly to our texts prior to our arrival. Since we had a long day of travel we met the next morning. She gave us great suggestions for sightseeing and places to eat. The place was accurately depicted in their pictures and quite comfy.

We especially loved the heated floors in the morning! We really appreciated Amanda and Toni's personal touch. The neighborhood has great walking and close proximity to stores, restaurants and coffee shops. There is also a lovely natural area just across the street. The bus lines run close by providing easy access to downtown and other parts of Seattle. "
3906076,18967808,2014-09-03,991530,Mike,"This is the perfect little apartment. Very comfortable, tidy and clean. The location is incredibly central and easily within walking distance to the waterfront and to numerous restaurants and bars. The convention center is literally next door so very convenient for any conventions. Ezana was very hospital and went out of his way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Seattle."
3906076,19291849,2014-09-09,20337419,Lerin,Ezana was such a great hosts. Everything was very streamline and easy. Our schedule was accommodated. Ezana checked in with us the very next day after our first night just to make sure we were ok and to let us know if we needed anything we could contact with any questions. Condo is exactly how described and pictures shown. The entire condo was stocked with anything you could ever need. It was a great location. We walked everywhere. We didn't even get a car because all we needed to see was right up the street. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this place!  
3906076,19430259,2014-09-12,20514526,Kevin,"Thank you Ezana for providing a wonderful clean cozy place for me to stay on my recent trip to Seattle.  You made it quite easy by meeting when I arrive, and thank you for giving me tips on places to eat, drink etc..Your place is centrally located and within a short walk to downtown Seattle. The proximity to convention centre is unbelievably close, so this is a great place if you're attending a conference.  I will definitely recommend your place to any friends of mine who may be visiting Seattle in the future. Thanks again!"
3906076,19697933,2014-09-16,1036120,Jason,"This was my first visit to Seattle and Enzana (owner) was very helpful with recommendations, and very accommodating in regards to our arrival and departure.  He even had a bottle of wine and a welcome message which pleasant and inviting touch. My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay at this property. It is right in the heart of Seattle, and only a few blocks away from shopping, bars, and food. The apartment is quiet and extremely comfortable. I would stay at this property again in a heartbeat. I can't think of a single negative comment to make. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. Amazing host, amazing property, and an amazing city. "
3906076,19973524,2014-09-21,6722652,Jonathan,"It was great. Easy, good communication, place was clean, and everything was ready to go."
3906076,20152600,2014-09-24,10018883,Graham,"We recently stayed at Ezana's place for a long weekend.  Ezana went above and beyond to make us feel at home.  He was incredibly responsive to text messages and emails, and checking in at the apartment was a breeze.

The apartment is just as represented in the pictures.  It is clean and relatively spacious for a 1-br.  Ezana was kind enough to give us a bottle of Washington wine for our stay, which was such a treat.  He even thinks of little things that make traveling easier, like mini-toothpastes, mouthwashes, soaps, etc.  He also stocked the fridge with a ton of bottled water.  Again, way above and beyond our expectations, and made our trip so much easier and more fun.

Ezana knows Seattle very well and is happy to provide his insights about restaurants, parks, etc.  We were in Seattle with a toddler, and Ezana responded very quickly to a text asking about a good outdoor area for our little one to run around.

Overall, this is a great place and nice value.  We would happily stay here again if our travels bring us back to Seattle.  Book with confidence!"
3906076,20458059,2014-09-29,846353,Pamela,"Ezana was an amazing host, and my boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better apartment for our vacation stay. The location was perfect; Pike Place Market, the light rail station (goes to the airport), monorail to Seattle Center, and many bus lines were all accessible within a few blocks.  The apartment itself was clean and Ezana even left out mini toiletries for us.  There is a laundry room down the hallway which was great for us since we were almost running out of clothes after having spent a few days in SF prior to arriving in Seattle."
3906076,20628167,2014-10-02,367760,Ashley,"I had a great stay! The unit is right next to the convention center. I rented a car, but really wish I hadn't (minimum $20 a day parking at nearby lots). The place was clean, had all the amenities needed, and Ezana was very helpful!"
3906076,21960359,2014-10-27,21618930,Peter,"Stayed at Ezana's place last weekend while in town for a conference. The place is nice, clean, and perfectly located close to Pike street and the convention center. Would not hesitate to stay there again in the future. "
3906076,22374874,2014-11-04,7383875,Kelly,Great location! Was able to walk everywhere without any issue. Tons of great restaurants just up the street and shopping centers 10 minutes away. The kitchen was nice for cooking breakfast. Overall an excellent stay!

3906076,24765789,2015-01-02,5003093,Amanda,"Ezana's condo was perfect for our visit to Seattle. It was walking distance to all of our destinations, public transportation, and grocery stores. It was clean and had all of the basics. The bed was really comfortable, wifi was strong, the water pressure was (email hidden)l in all, a great place to stay.
Ezana was very pleasant, accommodating, and responsive to my questions both before and during our stay. I definitely recommend this listing!"
3906076,25276684,2015-01-11,5480473,John,Ezana was an excellent host and made sure his condo was well stocked with everything a busy traveler would need. I really appreciated the excellent info he gave me about the area.
3906076,25637858,2015-01-21,6904561,Audrey,"Ezana was a great host! She was very communicative leading up to our arrival. Her apartment was perfect for us! The location is so convenient (right near the convention center) when arriving from the airport, and it's just a short walk down to Downtown and Pike Market or up the hill into Capitol Hill.  Ezana had a lovely bottle of wine and two glasses waiting for us upon our arrival, and she was even able to accommodate our later departure and let us keep our bags at her place while we explored the city. Thank you Ezana!!  "
3906076,26548694,2015-02-15,13522234,Rosario,"Ezana was very nice! He showed me the building and the apartment. He was always available for me in case I need anything related to the apartment or the city itself. 
The listing was completely accurate. Even though the building has many years, the apartment is in very good conditions. You can tell that Ezana takes care of every detail.
The apartment location is the best, near everything and on a quite quiet street. 
"
3906076,28394163,2015-03-23,27183698,Stefanie,"The condo was wonderful. Within walking distance of almost everything and the condo, impeccably clean.  This was our first Airbnb experience and our host was accommodating above and beyond my expectations. Could not recommend more highly."
3906076,28701423,2015-03-29,17087963,Vanessa,Ezana is a lovely host! There was a bottle of wine on the counter for us when we arrived (though we didn't drink it) and he was prompt in helping when something went wrong.
3906076,29209863,2015-04-05,7139043,Anthony,Ezena is a great host.  I really enjoyed the stay.  Thank you so much.  
3906076,29914163,2015-04-14,25306801,Mark,The condo was wonderful!  Great location and clean and homey.  It was a breeze to get to the convention center every day and it's a great jumping off point for other destinations in Seattle.  Thank you!
3906076,30499212,2015-04-23,2058350,Aaron,"I was visiting Seattle for a conference being held at the Washington State Convention Center in downtown (4 minute walk). I couldn't have found a better and more convenient place to stay. Ezana's condo has easy and walkable access to many of Seattle's amenities including downtown, Pikes Place Market, and the Capital Hill neighborhood. 

I got into town late on a Friday night and Ezana ensured that I knew my way to the condo and had immediate access. Ezana was great about checking in with me and making sure my stay was a comfortable one. While I didn't spend much time at the condo, I always looked forward to a good nights rest that I knew I could rely on. The bed is great, and the condo is located in a very quiet edge of downtown.

Overall Ezana and his place provided everything I needed: close proximity to downtown, a great place to crash, a great price, and an accommodating host. Perfect."
3906076,31572962,2015-05-07,27548950,Fatemeh,"Ezena is a great and responsive host. We stayed here while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and it was perfect, only 4 minutes walking to the conference center. I really enjoyed the stay. Thank you so much for your help and valuable information."
3906076,31769170,2015-05-10,25788849,Ryan,"Ezana was great and made us feel very welcome! We stayed here while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and it was perfect.  It was very close to the venue and only a 2 min walk down some stairs to get there.  The apartment was just like described and was close to many things within walking distance, we really enjoyed our stay!"
3906076,32565161,2015-05-19,20941971,Sarah,"Me and a friend came to Seattle on pleasure and had an awesome time. Ezana's place was perfect! It was so close to both downtown and Captial Hill, walking distance to everything. We could walk down to Pikes Place for breakfast every morning. The pictures do not do the place justice, it was very clean and had everything that we needed! The bed was extremely comfortable especially after a long day or exploring the city. Ezana was a great host, he made sure we had everything we needed and was always there if we had any questions. Very knowledgable and a hospitable host. We would most definitely stay here again if we ever make the trip back out to Seattle! I highly recommend staying here if you want to be close to everything in the city! Fantastic location! "
3906076,33780676,2015-06-01,27942215,Steffen,"Ezana is a very sympathetic, friendly and totally uncomplicated guy. He showed us everything in detail, gave us recommendations for stuff to do in town - and he even took us with his car to the airport. 

There is probably everything you need right around the corner, like a grocery store, Starbucks, restaurants, cafes, ect. 

The nice apartment is located right in the center of Seattle. It has Wifi/internet, cable and all that tech stuff. In the kitchen there is everything you need - there was also battled water in the fridge and ice cubes in the freezer. And there was just everything else you can imagine: batteries, pens, a complete toilet tree (even shaving foam) and much more stuff I just cannot remember. So if you forgot to put something in your bag - a substitution is probably there anyways. 

The apartment is clean and comfy, however it can get a bit noisy because of the highway that is kind of close (however, for us this was not a big deal).

I would totally book this place again and would recommend it."
3906076,34141954,2015-06-05,32626603,Britney,"The location was excellent - very close to everything downtown, the shopping district and Pike Place Market.  I was staying in Seattle for a conference at the Sheraton and was very easy to walk there and took less than 5 minutes! Ezana was great in making me and my friend feel welcome - even had a bottle of wine for us! "
3906076,34701696,2015-06-11,30623157,Juan,"Ezana was an excellent host. His place was fantastic and in an awesome location. He was extremely accommodating, even allowing us to sign out a bit later."
3906076,35371131,2015-06-18,4298062,Giovanni,"Excellent location, less than a 10 min walk up the hill from Pikes Market, probably one of the most convenient locations I have ever stayed at in a major city. Also right down the street from Capital Hill. My wife and I rented a car and there is free parking less than 250ft from the front door. The apartment felt very homie and was just the right fit for us two (even had umbrellas ready for us!)

To cap off this spectacular apartment, Ezana is that much better of a host. He was available day and night and answered any question we threw at him. He also gave us suggestions on where to go and gave a dead honest local's opinion on Trip Advisor spots, which was much appreciated. When we go back to Seattle, we are definitely staying here!"
3906076,35776037,2015-06-22,15584374,Ron,"Nice apartment, fabulous location, and a truly wonderful host. 5 stars all the way!!"
3906076,36097769,2015-06-25,32202126,Randy,"Listing was very accurate.  Great place in a really cool, historic building.  Ezana was extremely friendly and accommodating, making sure I had all the information I needed for a positive experience from planning, through arrival and departure."
3906076,36513787,2015-06-29,1219720,Diane,"Great place, great location, great host! This was the perfect place for us as I attended a conference at the convention center. The center is just up some stairs and across a park-very convenient. Ezana gave us a nice welcome and was available if needed. I'd stay here again if I had a reason to visit downtown Seattle. "
3906076,37645009,2015-07-09,29476950,Márcio,"Awesome place nearby everything! If you never been to Seattle like me you'll really love the location! I had been there in July with my fiancée and we loved it!
There are a lot of places to go nearby and also it's pretty easy to get public transportation (Link, Monorail, Streetcar and buses). If you decide to use the public transportation I would strongly recommend to buy an ORCA card and add a Day Pass every day you need ($8 to get any bus and Link all day long).
Ezana was waiting for us when we arrived and talked about all the things we needed to know of the apartment and the building. He had been very helpful even prior to our stay when we asked him some questions. Sadly we'd been there for just a few days and we hadn't had much time to interact with him as we had been really busy.
Anyway, Ezana is a great host which even left us a bottle o wine upon our arrival! Deeply recommended!"
3906076,38117298,2015-07-13,7174240,Anthony,Ezana was great!  He met us at the door and made sure everything was to our liking.  He also had a map and showed us how to get around to some of the highlights of the city.  The condo was very clean and our time in Seattle was wonderful.  
3906076,38582903,2015-07-17,847242,Brandon,My experience in Ezana's place was awesome. The location is PERFECT. Just a half block away from Pike right downtown. The apartment is clean and nice. Ezana was very helpful. I would definitely recommend staying there!
3906076,39014883,2015-07-20,27668550,Maxx,Ezana was a fantastic host.  He was very welcoming and offered to stick around after meeting us to point out a few highlights on the map.  He had all the accommodations we could ask for and the apartment was in a great location.  
3906076,39615648,2015-07-25,32791565,Jim,"Ezana met us at the door after an eight hour train ride.  He showed us the apartment and even left us  a bottle of red wine to enjoy.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and close to all the places we wanted to visit.  His list on the refrigerator was very helpful.  We would highly recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle. "
3906076,40086485,2015-07-28,31788655,Jean,Ezana was a great host. He was there to meet us and give us helpful information about Seattle's sights. The place was spacious and very comfortable. The location was also great as it is within walking distance of downtown and many buses. 
3906076,40902208,2015-08-03,32505234,Ashley,This place was great and Ezana was a great host. He greeted us when we first got there and made sure that our questions were answered. He gave good advice on where to go in downtown Seattle for what we were looking to do. The condo is exactly as described. It looks exactly like the pics. It close enough to downtown that a can ride is super inexpensive and walking was no problem. In fact we walked everywhere! It was great though. I would definitely stay here again if I came to Seattle if Ezana would have me.
3906076,41926004,2015-08-10,30457741,Nathan,"Had a great experience. He was there to greet me first thing, and made sure to explain everything I needed to know. Left us every single thing we needed to live like we where at home. Couldn't ask for anything more, highest recommendation "
3906076,43615704,2015-08-21,33764785,Jordan,"The condo was really fantastic. Everything was centrally located and it was so easy to get everywhere in the city. The condo looks exactly like the pictures and is very clean. Ezana was a great host and the listing had everything that we needed. He was also extremely accommodating when a flight delay meant that he had to meet us really late upon arrival. When we did come in, he took the time to show us a map of the city and pointed out key sights. Definitely whole-heartedly recommend this listing! "
3906076,44124052,2015-08-24,24877661,Katelyn,I would definitely stay here again if I ever come to Seattle again. The place is conveniently located next to all the downtown main attractions. The apt. is well maintained and look just like the pictures.  Ezana is  a great host and took the time to explain everything including showing us attractions around the area. 
3906076,45361616,2015-09-02,19648275,Patrick,"The host could not have been better if he tried :) He was an absolutely awesome host with tons of recommendations for the area and was more than readily available for us. 

The location was exactly as described, we totally loved the apartment and the building it was in. I totally didn't realize the air conditioning units were not the norm in Seattle lol so the first night was a little warm, but the rest of the nights were actually cool so it was perfect. The apartment comes with a free standing fan that certainly helped too :)

This rental is centrally located allowing extremely easy access to the convention center, shops, restaurants, and even Pike Place Market!

Would absolutely stay here again :D"
3906076,45944974,2015-09-07,7308886,Ben & Debbie,"Very well located in central Seattle.  Clean and comfortable.  Ezana provided a great bottle of wine to welcome our (4) day visit.  We were within walking distance to shopping and great restaurants (you really don't need to rent a car, if central Seattle is where your activities are).   Uber was very useful, when were late for dinner.  Cost from the Needle, about $4-5, back to the apartment.  Thank you scheduling a little rain for our visit...  We (from CA) almost forgot what rain looked like.   We would come back again,  Ben & Debbie"
3906076,46697344,2015-09-13,12271578,Jeonghwan,"Ezana was a great and kind host, and his condo was really great. His condo was well equipped and clean, and the location was perfect for me!!
The Washington Convention Center was very close from his condo, so it was very convenient for me to attend the meeting at WCC. And the grocery and good cafe were within 3-minute walk distance. 
I recommend his condo to my friends!"
3906076,47168592,2015-09-16,15905797,Gina,"I was very pleased overall with my stay at Ezana's condo. Communication with him before and during my trip was always responsive and efficient. We unfortunately did not get to meet upon my arrival, so Ezana left the condo keys in a lock box which was very easy to find with his thorough instructions during check in.

The condo is conveniently located in a central area. My bf and I were able to walk to Pikes Place in 15-20 mins literally every day! I also liked that it was a few blocks away from Capitol Hill, which offered many restaurant choices and some few boutique shops.

The condo itself was very tidy and exactly as described in the posting and pictures. It was the perfect size for two people and equipped with all the basic necessities. He even left a bottle of wine which we appreciated a lot! He had many brochures, maps and magazines with all things Seattle if you needed more info or any tips for your stay.

I would recommend Ezana's place if you are looking for a place to stay and enjoy Seattle.
"
3906076,47964963,2015-09-22,24225951,Jason,"Ezana was great, the places was just ask described and pictured, not problems, very helpful and knowledgable about the area. "
3906076,49100484,2015-10-01,31644480,Joyce,"The condo met my needs well.  Ezana met me at the front door and oriented me to the condo.  The condo, while older is very well maintained and clean.  The location was convenient to the Convention Center and more affordable than the local hotels."
3906076,49800340,2015-10-06,12763256,Crystal,"This is where you want to stay in Seattle. It is in the perfect location. Steps (seriously about 100 feet) from downtown, Pikes Place Market, a wonderful restaurant corridor, across the street from amazing coffee, and about 4 blocks to the bustling fun nightlife. With all of this Seattle still manages to be quaint, quiet, and family friendly. Our host should teach other hosts how to act. He was attentive ( texting back right away and meeting us at the apartment at our convenience!) he then took 5 minutes to tell us how to get around Seattle with a map. The apartment is actually more beautiful than the pictures. And the cleanest one I've ever been in. He provided wine! Toothpaste and mouthwash, yogurt and water. Wow! Oh and the apartment is on a quiet street with lush trees and on a side street so nice privacy. Best airbnb I've been in. Thanks!!"
3906076,50745323,2015-10-14,4699338,Bruno,"I had a great stay at Ezana's condo in Seattle. The location is perfect, just between downtown and Capitol Hill, meaning that I could get everywhere on foot very easily. The condo is very well appointed, and is very accurately described in the text and photos. The immediate surroundings can be a bit eerie at night (particularly with the seemingly large population of homeless people in Seattle), but I did not feel unsafe at any moment. There are lots of great eateries nearby, and I would strongly recommend Café Victrola on Pike and Li'l Woody's Burger on Pine. Ezana is a very accommodating host, and made me feel super welcome. I would not hesitate to recommend or stay again."
3906076,52080524,2015-10-26,44130497,Taylor,"Ezana was communicative, helpful, and friendly. The place was spotless and comfortable. Highly recommended!"
3906076,52637946,2015-10-31,46964258,Ami,"Ezana was very communicative and easy to deal with. the condo is just as described. Had a very pleasant time there, it is located a few hundred feet from the WA convention center which was my destination so that was very convenient. The place was clean and fully equipped. I will be renting from Ezana again next year for my annual conference."
3906076,53518660,2015-11-09,9693896,Austin,"Ezana’s apartment was exactly as described and made for a perfect extended weekend stay in Seattle! I was attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center, and I had the freedom to come back between sessions because the apartment was just a couple minute walk right around the corner.  Capitol Hill, Pike’s Place Market, and downtown are all short walks as well. 

The apartment itself is nice and spacious, with ample room for the two of us.  The pictures and description give a great idea of what to expect, and the kitchen is fully stocked if you want to do some cooking.  Communication with Ezana was easy and efficient.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
3906076,54856937,2015-11-25,30869838,Jeff,"Ezana's made the entire process wonderful, from email communications to meeting me onsite.  I loved this roomy one bedroom condo.  Nice amenities include a bit kitchen, dishwasher, roomy bathroom and a large bedroom.  The location is perfect to all downtown activities on a quite peaceful street."

everything went well!

1084046,13016880,2014-05-17,7978519,Brad,"Jordan's unit was great!  Access to it was well instructed and easy, and it was in a great location!  I would highly recommend this unit to others."
1084046,13252524,2014-05-23,15103302,Meng,"Good place for 5 to 6 people to live! We stayed there 2 days, and everything is comfortable and clean. And Jordan is very responsible. "
1084046,16598999,2014-07-29,12939834,Todd,"The apartment was great, and so was Jordan's communication. He was very responsive and gave very clear directions on accessing the apartment. The apartment is large and has great city views."
1084046,24677314,2015-01-01,4792460,Camilia,"Our family stayed at the Metropolitan Towers Apartment from Dec 30, 2014-Jan 1, 2015.  The location was great! Just a few blocks from Pacific Place - where all the shopping is.  We basically walked everywhere, even to Pike Market - though it's an uphill climb back up to the apartment.  We had an 18month old with us, and the apartment was perfect in that he had plenty of space without worrying if he'd break anything or hurt himself.  The apartment itself was nice and clean and had everything we needed for a 3 day trip.  

Stay alfred was very easy to deal with when it came to the carbon monoxide alarm that was acting up.  We called to get it fixed on New Year's eve and they were very accommodating.

I only have two issues, one is that the pictures are not exactly as advertised.  The layout of the apartment itself was slightly different. but they do give you an idea of what to expect.

The other is that we came to Seattle to watch the fireworks for NYE, and thought we'd have a view from the courtyard (as per the pictures).  Unfortunately, since there is a building being constructed across the street now, Metropolitan Towers no longer has a view of the Space Needle.  No worries though, the baby was sleeping anyway and we were able to catch the fireworks on TV.  

Overall, I'd stay at any other Stay Alfred apartment again.    "
1084046,26133427,2015-02-04,8785709,Doug,"Great location right in the middle of downtown Seattle.
The apartment was clean and had everything that I needed while I stayed there. I would certainly stay here again."
1084046,35391567,2015-06-18,8162473,Diana,"Wonderful, spacious, convenient luxury condo.  Our host, Jordan, was very responsive and check-in/out was easy. 

We were a party of 4 adults and 1 toddler. This place sleeps up to 6 adults. The walk-in closet in the master bedroom was big enough to unfold a roll away bed (there were two total provided).  My son loved having his own space.  
We also took advantage of the pool area which was awesome! Wish we could have stayed longer and used the rest of the amenities.  
Extremely convenient public transportation and parking space available but we decided not to rent a car. 
My only input is that the carpet was quite soiled and the garbage disposal in the sink was broken.  
Other than that,  we had a great time staying at the MET. We would love to book with Jordan again next time we're in town!



  "
1084046,41600277,2015-08-08,5478070,Thomas,"The metro apartment was absolutely amazing! We got amazing feedback from the people staying there, who were very comfortable.

1084046,49386834,2015-10-03,42986250,Shauna,"We loved our stay at Metropolitan Towers! 
Jordan was friendly to deal with and the instructions for checking in and out were easy to follow. Our check in went smoothly :)
The apartment was well laid out and the beds were comfortable. The walls must be thick because I don't think we heard a peep in the halls or from neighboring units. The residents of the building and the concierge staff were all friendly and helpful as well.

613020,1845281,2012-07-30,931391,Donald,"My wife and I booked our trip to explore Seattle and celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had such a great time we are thinking of doing this every year!

Even before meeting Mardee, she was very prompt and responsive to our request through airtbnb. On arriving, Mardee provided everything that one might expect of a premier Inn. The room is a recently remodeled area adjoining the garage. (Underneath the main house.) There were books to read, travel and tourist brochures, coffee and tea, refrigerator, microwave, convection oven, heater, abundant dresser space, closet space, a shower and bathroom, and even toiletries (if we forgot to bring anything)! She was very gracious and accommodating, providing parking space for our car and was available to help us with whatever we needed.

The view from the balcony and our room provided panoramic views of Puget Sound. At night, we saw distant fireworks on Vashon Island. West Seattle feels like an island of serenity, close enough to downtown Seattle to take it in, but far from the hustle and bustle. There was a beautiful seaside park close by where we put in our kayak, and a bicycle trail that goes around the Sound that we enjoyed on our bike. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to staying with Mardee every year!"
613020,1887809,2012-08-04,3084849,Stefan,"It was a wonderful short Holiday nearby Mardee. The View is more than ""Fabulous"". Quiet and very nice. But you must see it by your own. Also a great place to relax or enjoy the Environment. By car you need around 10 till 15 minutes to Seattle Dontown."
613020,1907294,2012-08-06,3084777,Susan,"Our stay at Mardee's lovely home was wonderful!  It was clean & comfortable and filled with plenty of things we may need.  We loved having our own bathroom and private entrance!  Mardee was fantastic to chat with and provided a lot of information about the area, as well as accommodating with anything we needed.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
613020,1951649,2012-08-11,2144780,Sandra,"Mardee is an absolutely wonderful host and an interesting person. I arrived on a rare 95 degree day in Seattle and she had a smile on her face and an chilled ice tea in her hand for me, very thoughtful. 

She is very helpful and the epitome of a graceful woman. Accommodations were fantastic and private. You will love the gorgeous West Seattle sunsets and view from her home from the special spot just for guests. She went beyond what a regular AirBNB host might do and it was very much appreciated. Thank you,Mardee, I hope our paths cross again one day, you are truly one of the NW's gems. xo"
613020,1975928,2012-08-13,3087730,Jamie,Mardee was a great host! She was helpful with ideas about what to do in Seattle and listened sincerely to what I had to say. The room she provided was clean and cozy. Excellent view and safe neighborhood! I would definitely stay here again!
613020,2060308,2012-08-21,2019171,Allison & Jerry,"If you 'like' views of Puget Sound, sailing boats, a beautiful yard, a cozy room, and a gracious host, this is the place.  My wife and I are from Seattle, so we usually have a packed agenda.  But we both agreed that if time had allowed, just sitting outside and enjoying the view a serenity would have been in order.  There are a couple of nice dining establishments about two blocks away.  I am just under 6 feet, but the low ceiling were not an issue.  Mardee had some great coffee available, and even was able to get us some honey!  She has left plenty of things to read from novels to current magazines and tons on literature on the local Seattle / West Seattle scene.  We go to Seattle every other month or so and look forward to staying here again, if she isn't already booked up!   "
613020,2103205,2012-08-26,2910563,Nancy,"Mardee is gentle, joyful, provided suggestions and directions that made an enjoyable stay. A nice location to relax and downtown is accessible by bus. I  greatly recommend."
613020,2163585,2012-09-01,2784164,Beth,"Mardee was a fantastic host. My assistant and I arrived very tired. Mardee came in with beautiful glasses of apple mint tea which were unbelievably refreshing and delicious. We sat and talked with her like we were old girlfriends. The view from her property was gorgeous. Our apartment was very comfortable and perfect for what we needed. One of the best cafes in Seattle was right around the corner, Endolyne Joe's, which was just icing on the cake."
613020,2181233,2012-09-03,2885974,Alan,Mardee was very gracious and accommodating during our visit.  We had a delightful conversation with her about her volunteer work and she provided us with lots of useful information about West Seattle and the surrounding area.  The room was clean and quiet.  We would definitely stay again!
613020,2218227,2012-09-06,3352329,Rosie,"Mardee is a wonderful host. She has all types of information about the area, things to do and see, eateries, etc. The room is comfortable and cozy. The ceilings are a bit low, but you immediately forget that fact as soon as you see the beautiful setting of her home. The view is amazing."
613020,2264239,2012-09-11,3263661,Mary,"Mardee's place was delightful.  I slept very well, comfortable bed, very quiet, clean.  What a beautiful area with a view of  bay/sound.  Convenient to all areas.  Mardee is a welcoming host and I felt if I needed anything she was available.

I would stay there again! "
613020,2328499,2012-09-17,3542216,Calvin,"Thank you to Mardee and her warm hospitality. It allowed me to spend important time with my daughter, husband and family.  Her house could not be in a better neighborhood, a short couple block walk tom the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal and leisurely recreational walk through Lincoln Park, right on Puget Sound.  The mother in law suite is well kept and comfortable. Mardee set you up with teas and coffee if you do desire.
I would recommend Mardee if you are looking for a genuine relaxing stay."
613020,2348462,2012-09-19,2315832,Abbie,"Mardee's basement suite was everything we needed. You will not find a more gracious and hospitable hostess. She greeted us with glasses of apple-mint iced tea, and good conversation. The room is so cozy and pleasant, and Mardee has gone out of her way to provide everything you could possibly need for comfort, convenience, and information--even a pretty shopping bag! We especially appreciated having dishes available in the mini-kitchen area, plus a generous stash of teas, coffee beans and a coffee grinder, and even instant oatmeal.

The view really is stunning, and you'll want to spend time in the comfy lawn chairs Mardee also provides just for you, if the weather is fine. We were lucky to have glorious weather for our trip.

The room has two very comfortable twin beds with very nice bedding. They worked just fine pushed together for a couple.

My partner Sally and I used to live in Southworth, so being so close to the Fauntleroy-Southworth ferry was perfect for the day we spent visiting friends in Kitsap County. West Seattle is also a great base for going into the city, and well worth exploring on its own. We were in town for a family gathering, and had a wonderful time with all our visiting.

Mardee is lovely, and so is her guest suite. We hope we'll have the chance to stay with her again!"
613020,2380655,2012-09-23,3120588,Bill,Mardee was a very gracious and interesting host.  We enjoyed our stay there.  It was a perfect location for visiting Seattle.  Nice neighborhood.  The views from her home are very nice overlooking the water and the ferries.  We would stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.  
613020,2449400,2012-09-29,1238047,John,I went to Seattle on a business trip and stayed with Mardee. She was  a great host. The space was clean with a big shower. The view from her Balcony was fantastic. I would definitely book with Mardee again on my next trip to Seattle. 
613020,2480052,2012-10-01,358117,Jill,"Mardee's place & location was absolutely perfect! Walking to the ferry and along the sound in nearby Lincoln Park was ideal for me, and the peaceful quiet neighborhood made for some sound sleeping. The cozy studio apartment had everything you could need for a short weekend getaway! "
613020,2500899,2012-10-03,3691724,Paul,Her place is as advertised. It's on a hill overlooking a large lake. It's insanely serene. I was traveling alone but the room can easily accommodate a couple. You have your own bathroom. Nice cable tv as well. It's a home away from home. There is a great restaurant a little more than 5 minute walking distance. I had the best fish and chips there. Mardee is kind and really easy going. I'm definitely going to visit Seattle again and I would def stay there again. 
613020,2539674,2012-10-08,2764511,John,"Excellent location: fifteen minutes from SEATAC and (depending on traffic) 20 from downtown Seattle.  Also a quick drive to the heart of SW shopping on California Ave.

The basement apartment is simple, functional and cozy. The view of the sound, lovely.   If you like quiet, this is the place.  The only sounds are the seagulls and the low rumble of the Vashon ferry when it docks near Lincoln park, a five minute drive down the hill from the house. 

 Walk two blocks to a great boutique bakery and Joe's eatery for breakfast or dinner.  Also a Mexican restaurant.

Beware if you are a tall person, the ceilings are only 6'6"" away at their lowest spots.  I am 6' and had no problem with it.  The beds are sublimely comfortable and the shower is a large walk-in. 

 Mardee is very attentive to details and makes sure you have what you need to make your stay as comfortable and convenient as possible.  An excellent hostess.

If you are planning a short stay in SW Seattle and don't mind being in a quiet hillside neighborhood overlooking the Sound in simple, homey surroundings and don't mind sharing two twin beds rather than a queen, this is a delightful and affordable choice.  We plan to return.

"
613020,2577285,2012-10-10,711772,Alejandro,"We had an awesome time in Seattle. Mardee's place is very comfortable, convenient and has a wonderful view. With a bus stop located at walking distance (5 minutes), it was very easy for us to get to the downtown and back. Also, she is very energetic and friendly. She even helped us to figure out the bus routes and to call a cab. Definitely a place to come back. Thanks so much Mardee! "
613020,3693364,2013-03-04,5224127,Janice,"This location was perfect for us.  This is a beautiful neighborhood near the the ferry, park and restaurants.  The accommodations were comfortable and Mardee provided great easy breakfast items and coffee for us to start our day."
613020,4394989,2013-05-02,5800283,Scott,"Could not have had a more relaxing time. Room was comfortable and a beautiful location. easy to get to  public transportation to anywhere. Mardee could not have been nicer.The room was stocked with everything you may need or forgot to bring. It was a lovely time.
Scott parker"
613020,4510297,2013-05-09,6046251,David,"I spent a pleasant week with Mardee making daily trips to Vashon Island and also telecommuting and studying. Her place is a pleasant 5 minute walk to the ferry, to transit, to a bakery with good lattes and very fresh pastries, and to a very friendly breakfast-place/bar/restaurant. If you want to take a longer walk, or hop in your car, there is also prime Vietnamese food a mile-and-a-half away in White Center - try the restaurant called ""88"". And of course, the best sushi in Seattle can be had at Mashiko in West Seattle.

As for the room, the roomy basement more than makes up for the low ceiling; there is a very comfy desk chair and table at which I worked for hours, and a cozy bed. Mardee also will set up a deck chair for you outside from which you can survey the beautiful view. Overall, a very pleasant place to stay!"
613020,4880154,2013-05-30,6390080,Karen,"We had a very nice stay at Mardee's. She was such a gracious host and the room provided was clean and comfy. There were nice extra's such as coffee, tea,instant oatmeal and bananas. The room has all you need as far as shampoo,soap, towels ect... Her place is located in a beautiful area a block or two from the C Line, which will take you directly to the downtown area. We enjoyed visiting with Mardee. She was very easy to talk to and was so very helpful in suggesting places and even helped us by printing out directions to a place we were trying to find. I would not hesitate to stay again. If you'd like a friendly host and a very pretty environment this would be a great choice! Thanks Mardee, we had a lot of fun visiting Seattle!"
613020,4910781,2013-06-01,6278843,Mary Ann,"Very friendly hostess, nice accommodations, and great view!  We arrived a bit later than originally expected; Mardee was readily available by phone and very understanding.  She was very helpful in answering our questions and recommended a great local restaurant where we ate frequently.  Although accommodations were in basement, everything was clean and everything we could possibly need was right there.  Location was convenient for transportation to downtown Seattle. We would definitely recommend this place!"
613020,5025326,2013-06-08,6442646,Katie Devoe,Fabulous place....it was exactly as described clean and spacious....mardee was a great host we got in late to Seattle and she was very (email hidden)fe neighborhood and a short walk to the bus stop....we really didn't explore her neighborhood with the little time we had but it seemed great I a specially liked that mardee had a book with suggestions and directions to area spots..... The beds where clean and comfortable and breakfast items where left for us if we wanted....I highly recommend this place ....when I go back to Seattle I wont stay anywhere else :) 
613020,5103203,2013-06-12,6392386,Robert,"Last month I had the pleasure of staying at Mardee's wonderful home while on vacation.  The bus, ferry, and some local stores are a short walk away, and the view is wonderful!  The room is top notch and has more amenities than any 5 star hotel I've experienced, with the added benefit of feeling like home! Should you forget anything at home, the room is bound to have a solution (towels, coffee, sampoo, rest). Mardee went well out of her way to aid me with my travels in Seattle and to make me feel at home.  She is very kind and thoughtful and respectful of privacy.  If I'm in the Seattle area again I will be sure to see if this room is on airbnb again.  Thanks!"
613020,5152951,2013-06-15,2995734,Kelli,"Location, location location!  Just a beautiful place to stay and watch the sunset over Puget Sound while overlooking the Fauntleroy ferries while sitting on Adirondack chairs on the front lawn enjoying a glass of chardonnay.  Mardee's home was lovely, the beds comfortable, all creature comforts in place.  Being familiar with the area, it was an easy place to navigate to and from.  Would absolutely stay here again if we have the opportunity.  Thank you, Mardee."
613020,5321996,2013-06-24,6522630,Cynthia,"THis is without doubt one of the most beautiful areas in Seattle. The view is indeed breathtaking, Mardee thought of everything to make our stay comfortable - especially the beds.  She's a generous hostess! We'll be back...."
613020,5435220,2013-06-30,6465719,Martin,"Location is excellent, walking distance to bus and to Lincoln park. Nearby neighborhoods have lots of options for restaurants within a couple minutes of driving. The space was overall comfortable and had the small details considered (extra soap, extra towels, coffee and cereal for breakfast in the place, etc). A little ways from downtown Seattle (20 minutes by bus), but we found it to be a peaceful getaway."
613020,5638458,2013-07-09,6506608,Michelle,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Mardee's place and would definately recomend you stay here.  The neighborhood was nice and peaceful with a great view right from her yard!. The room was comfy and she had extra toiletries in case you forgot something.  She greeted us warmly with a nice refreshing glass of apple and mint drink she made, showed us around and had lots of brochures on the area for things to do. She was there if you needed her but left you alone, you feel very welcome and she respects your space.  The location is great for exploring the city by car (or bus but we didn't get to that). Or taking walks from her place down the road past the ferry to Lincoln Park or to a wonderful bakery for lattes and pasteries all while enjoying  the scenery."
613020,5678407,2013-07-11,3064701,Larry,"We loved the location -- close to a good restaurant, ferry dock, great trails in Lincoln Park, and a pretty easy drive to Safeco Field to watch the Mariners. Quiet location. Beautiful view of Puget Sound. 

Mardee was very gracious. Our apartment was well-stocked with everything we could need. Very comfortable beds. Quiet.

Bit of a steep walk on the driveway or stairs. Not a problem for us but could be for some."
613020,5754917,2013-07-15,6626017,Andrea,"We enjoyed our stay with Mardee very much.  She is a great host.  She gives a very accurate description of her rental space.  It was very quiet, clean, private and has a fantastic view.  The location is great, a few blocks away from the beach and public transportation is right down the street, along with a great restaurant.  Mardee knows the Seattle area well and gave us several ideas of things to do and places to see and the room had abundant information about the area.  We would have liked to stay longer and would love to go back to Seattle again and stay with Mardee.  We appreciated her sharing her house with us.        "
613020,5820825,2013-07-17,7407870,Jing,Mrs Mardee is very nice and thoughtful. the house is so comfortable and the location of it is pretty convenient. She knows Seatle well and she introduced so many places of interest for me .
613020,5903059,2013-07-22,5251270,Tess,"Mardee went out of her way to make our stay in Seattle perfect. We could not have asked for a better location, with access to bus, and local attractions. Although we were in West Seattle for a wedding we were able to get everywhere we wanted to go in the Seattle metro area. If we go back to Seattle, and I am sure we will, we will want to stay with Mardee.

613020,6484530,2013-08-14,6296342,James Hoyt,"Mardee McElwee could not have been a more gracious host.  There were guidebooks and maps in the room.  She updated us on events locally she felt we might enjoy, and made restaurant suggestions that proved outstanding.  Her garden was beautiful and the view to the Sound quite lovely.  She provided us with a parking pass so we could park in the street and there was never a problem finding space. Being Seattle, the walk from street to room of course was steep, but good exercise. The neighborhood was friendly and even the postman knew Mardee and had nice things to say about her. The room was cleaned weekly and felt quite homey.  All in all, a very pleasant stay."
613020,6753437,2013-08-24,2363630,Mary,The view of the Puget Sound from Mardee's is fabulous! The room is clean and comfortable. Mardee has accumulated a terrific collection of information on things to do in Seattle. I appreciated the accessibility to public transportation. Mardee was a wonderful host.
613020,6816595,2013-08-26,7634516,Vicki,"Mardee was a wonderful hostess. When we arrived she was there to welcome us, our room was stocked with the necessities and she gave us great ideas of things to do and places to go during our visit to Seattle. Mardee provided maps and brochures for several different adventures throughout Seattle. 

This s a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Our room was very private and comfortable. The driveway up to the house is VERY steep, not ideal for anyone with major mobility issues, however I managed well, even with recently undergoing 4 knee surgeries. slow and steady is the key! It was an easy walk to the bus to take us downtown. On Mardee's advice we tried out the bakery which was a short walk from the home and it was delicious. 

Anyone who stays with Mardee should definitely visit Alki beach. It's a beautiful spot hidden away along the waterfront. We watched the most amazing sunset while dining on second floor outside deck at Duke's Chowder House. 

While there, we attended a Mariners game, we went to Pike's Market, The Big Wheel, The space needle, and took a Ferry ride. We had a great time and would recommend Mardee's house to anybody who wants to visit Seattle, be out of the main hustle and bustle yet still be close enough for easy down town access. 

We are already planning our next trip!  "
613020,6936914,2013-08-31,5547648,Barbara,Great apartment and great location.  I did not have a car but the bus stop was close by and it is a short trip to West Seattle and downtown Seattle.  It's also an easy walk to the ferry if you just want to get on the water for a short time or walk around the nearby park.  I enjoyed my stay and Mardee was a gracious host!!  I would definately return as there is so much to do in the area.  Thanks Mardee!!
613020,6989651,2013-09-02,7686654,Raquel,"The apartment that Mardee offers is absolutely fantastic!  It was a true Bed and Breakfast experience and to date, the best AirBnB I have ever booked!

After a long day of trekking around Seattle, I melted into one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in.  In the morning I toasted up some local sourdough she had left, along with a banana.  So many coffee and tea options too!  I chose to grind up fresh coffee beans and use the french press, however you can choose anything from instant to a standard coffee pot.  Mardee has left no stone unturned in regards to your comfort and options.  

Her place is about two blocks from the bus that can take you downtown or use to transfer to other buses that can take you to great places like Alki Beach.

Great nearby eateries and beautiful views and parks.

I would definitely recommend and stay here again if it were available!!"
613020,7070225,2013-09-05,7731800,Andrea,"I couldn't have wished for a better accommodation to finish my trip. I spent three days at Mardee's and enjoyed it very much. Mardee is an extraordinarily kind and friendly host. Not only did she provide all kind of useful information but also gave me a ride to the grocery store because I didn't have a car. 
The room is conveniently located, close to a bus stop and with a beautiful view. I can fully recommend it to anyone who is fond of a quiet and safe neighborhood and would definitely stay there again.   "
613020,7221991,2013-09-11,2413245,Michael,"Would highly recommend to stay at Mardee's when in Seattle! The place itself is very nice: quiet, with beautiful view and you can easily get there from downtown. Mardee was very friendly and hospitable, she helped us to plan our stay, provided maps and gave advice. Thank you Mardee!"
613020,7286455,2013-09-14,7410431,Nam-Heui,"Thanks to Mardee,

The place is quiet, clean and comfortable to stay.
Also, good to feel the beauty of Seattle. Walking distance
to beautiful beach, easy to access from airport and downtown.

Most of all, kindness of Mardee will make the visit unforgettable."
613020,7455472,2013-09-21,7336285,Susan,"Mardee's downstairs apartment was just the ticket for my recent week-long business event in West Seattle. She was a wonderful host, and she even asked if I wanted bananas when I arrived. Yes!

The room was clean, I had my own bathroom, and there was a mini-fridge and a hot water pot.

Oh, and the view from the front yard was a heavenly sight to behold as I departed early each morning. 

I was a happy camper.

P.S. If you get a chance, make sure to visit Lincoln Park just minutes away!"
613020,7681778,2013-09-29,4949991,John,"We had a very nice stay with Mardee.  The room is cozy and fun with lots of good information about the local area and breakfast snacks and yummy coffee.  Great shower.  Don't miss a walk in Lincoln Park.  Also the restaurants just down the block were great.  The twin beds are a little snug for two, but we cuddled!  I hope we get the chance to come back."
613020,7791373,2013-10-03,3081174,Ben,"There is so much to say about Mardee and her awesome house.  I'll start by saying Mardee has the place ready for you to arrive in the event that she isn't there.  When we arrived, she was there and greeted us at the door on a very rainy evening.  Mardee is very friendly and ready to give any advice you might need about the area.
The room itself is very clean and has everything you need from internet and cable tv to a refrigerator and coffee/fruit waiting for you.  Mardee's attention to detail is remarkable.  She has equipped the room with lots of reading material for new visitors to the Seattle area.
The twin beds (which at first admittedly made me apprehensive) are comfortable and in combination with a quiet house and neighborhood makes for a good night's sleep.
The view of Puget sound from the balcony is fantastic.  Mass transit is within walking distance from the house as well as some restaurants/coffee shops/bakery.
This is where I will be staying from now on whenever I am in the Seattle area.  No doubt about it.
Thank you Mardee for a very comfortable and fantastic experience!
"
613020,7875192,2013-10-07,8168472,Michael,"A wonderful location with a wondeful host.  Close to everything, but with the feel of being in a small town on the sound. 

On top of the thoughtful snacks (and coffee) that Mardee makes available for in-room comfort, the local diner and Alki Beach restaurants provided all we needed for good food with a great vibe (and view!).  "
613020,8103751,2013-10-15,6135352,Florin,"This is a lovely little place, very clean and friendly. We love Seattle! Thank you, Mardee."

613020,8644617,2013-11-10,9110624,Rose,"Mardee's place was perfect for my stay.  I was in town on business and was out and about every day.  The room comes with a fridge, microwave, coffee and tea makers and some teas, coffees, and other goodies to nourish you. Mardee was nice enough to bring down more filtered water as the week passed.  The ceiling is definitely low, but was fine for me.  A little TV and easily accessible WiFi were all I needed.  She has thoughtfully left out a LOT of touring materials if you are visiting for pleasure.  An AMAZING restaurant is only a block and a half away.  It looks like just a neighborhood hole in the wall, but is fantastic (Endolyne Joes).  Mardee also gave me a parking pass for my rental car so I was all taken care of.  Very quiet neighborhood, very close to the ferry, and a short jaunt up to the West Seattle Bridge."
613020,11173732,2014-03-24,11637799,Juliane,"Mardee was an extremely gracious host and her place could not have been more perfect for my weekend stay! Beyond the convenient location, it was very clean and well maintained, and Mardee was kind enough to leave a variety of cereals, fruit, and yogurt for me. I was grateful for the refrigerator, coffee maker, hot water pot, and all that I needed in the way of silverware and glasses! Thanks Mardee!!"
613020,14492505,2014-06-20,9150113,Penpak,Everything was exactly as advertised.  It was very private and Mardee is an excellent hostess.  We will stay with her again

613020,15000648,2014-06-30,16930804,Emilie,"Thanks for a lovely stay. A beautiful neighbourhood and a nice change from the usual Seattle experience. It was really close to a rapid transit route into the city so a great location for whatever you'd like to do. 
Mardee was a very nice host, wish I had stayed longer."
613020,15169405,2014-07-04,2851943,Véronique,"I enjoyed my stay at Mardee's place. The room is very nice and comfortable and the view is wonderfull. The bus stop to go downtown is close by and within 25mn ride you're at the Market Place.
It's very pleasant after a day dowtown to stroll in Lincoln Park and enjoy the Puget Sound. Mardee is a very nice host."
613020,15392152,2014-07-08,6506608,Michelle,"This is actually our 2nd time staying ay Mardee's. Its comfortable accommodations, quiet,  clean, peaceful with a nice view. You feel like your staying with a good friend! Everything is just like its described."

The neighborhood was also private and quiet. The views were gorgeous, and the lakeshore park was a short walk away."
613020,15824425,2014-07-16,16114300,Cheryl,This was one of many visits to Seattle but our first experience with Airbnb and it was great. Mardee is the perfect host with a home that has a view of Puget Sound that doesn't quit. She is very welcoming and offered lots of suggestions of places to visit in the surrounding area. The room is comfortable with a well-stocked refrigerator full of goodies for breakfast. We enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to our next stay at Mardee's.
613020,15981628,2014-07-19,17823259,Robert,Highly recommended! Easy access to downtown Seattle and Vashon Island. This is my first experience with Air B&B and will definitely try it again.
613020,16205700,2014-07-23,14976470,Joanne,"There really are not enough words to describe the view from Mardee's balcony and be sure to spend some time with a warm cup of coffee or tea and just sit back to enjoy!  Mardee was such a welcoming host, sharing her travel stories and also offering advice/suggestions on places to go in Seattle or things to enjoy.  Her space was inviting with all the comforts of home including a little kitchenette space filled with fresh fruit, a mini-fridge for perishables and a wide selection of breakfast treats.  "
613020,16310009,2014-07-25,9164032,Jackie,"We were very pleased with our accommodations.  This is our 4th experience using Airbnb in the last year and feel it was our best yet.  It was a perfect location, so close to everything. Mardee told us about Alki beach and some of the local restaurants and we were not disappointed.  The space itself was clean and comfortable: exactly as represented in the Airbnb ad. It was nice to experience the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle and then come home to this quiet neighborhood and relax.  The views from the upper deck are amazing.  We also spent lots of time at the nearby Lincoln Park.  Mardee was an excellent host."
613020,16846241,2014-08-03,17430913,Lauren,"Staying at Mardee's place in West Seattle will make your trip easy, interesting and enjoyable! The location is great for getting around with transit or otherwise- plus the location is just beautiful to be in! View is totally worth it and West Seattle/Alki has a lot to offer on its own! Mardee met us the night we arrived, showed us around and make us feel super comfortable. The breakfast supplies were a great added bonus as well and were very nice to have access too. The room made you feel at home and was plenty of space for the two of us. We stayed in Seattle a total of 6 days and felt at any time we could ask Mardee for information or help, great host, super nice lady! She even let us leave our luggage at her place for extra time since we didn't fly out until later at night.  Mardee's place is THE best and we definitely would recommend her and stay here again ourselves! Take note of what others wrote in her ""suggestion"" book, good insight into the city and what to do :) Don't make your decision hard, make it easy.. stay here!! "

Transport is really good in Seattle and easy to negotiate. Mardee is warm and accommodating host who ensures that you have a good stay. Thank you Mardee, I had a great time."
613020,17587528,2014-08-14,17052762,Jenny,Great stay in west Seattle. Near the water quiet area with easy access ( 30 min bus to downtown Seattle).  Mardee provided maps and info about local sites - wish we had longer to explore the beautiful Area. Be sure to stop in at Bakery Nouveau for croissants ( short drive from home). Can't wait to come back :)
613020,17953751,2014-08-19,18446012,Alexander,"We had a great time in Seattle thanks to the many tips Mardee provided. The room is comfy with a terrific view over Puget Sound, but Mardee's hospitality is the real bonus. "
613020,18194498,2014-08-23,17654929,Margaret,Mardee's home is in a lovely section of West Seattle. She took great care to be there to help me arrive and see the room. She is a very nice lady and so is her home! The room is very private with good wifi and a nice breeze at night. I was very busy on the trip and it was a wonderful place to come back to each night. The commute to UW was easy as was through Seattle. It is very close to the city! Thank you Mardee!
613020,18559977,2014-08-28,308023,Tina,"Mardee is a wonderful host. She made an effort to provide me w/ tea, milk, fruit, yogurt & a little kitchen area in the self-contained apt. The apt. itself is not large, but perfectly adequate for 1-2 ppl. Beds are very comfortable, everything clean. Street is quiet & the view of the bay superb. Bus is a 3 min. walk away, grocery store a 10-min. bus ride. Thank you, Mardee!"
613020,18943657,2014-09-03,8537476,Richard,"Ms McElwee greeted us when we arrived. She showed us the room and gave us the parking permit for the street parking.  The weather was good enough for her to show us the view from the upper terrace. if it had remained good enough I would have loved to sit out and watch Pudget Sound and the ferry coming and going.  The room is small but she has provided absolutely everything anyone could want. The small frig had milk and juices, jams for toast.  We had a small microwave, a coffee pot,a hot pot for water.  The beds were comfortable which my back really appreciated.  The linens appeared expensive.  It was a lovely place for us to spend our 3-4 days despite the weather and we hope to stay there again our next trip into Seattle.  "
613020,19073583,2014-09-06,16613,Kathy,"I love staying at Mardee's place! It feels like home away from home. It has a cottage feel as is very comfortable! It's clean, extremely we'll stocked!

613020,19231943,2014-09-08,20518997,Joann,"In spite of a rather late arrival,  I.e.well after midnight, Mardee was gracious and most accommodating. Our suite was very comfortable. The view of Puget Sound from the patio was glorious. West Seattle was lovely. The Last Chance Joe's restaurant served an amazing brunch on Sunday. His mashed red potatoes are not to be missed. Unfortunately our stay was too short! Mardee's place is highly recommended."
613020,19366347,2014-09-11,16613,Kathy,"Mardee was wonderful as always! She's always very welcoming, kind and helpful with all aspects of you're visit! Mardee manages to make you feel right at home while still providing privacy that you may need. Mardee has a well stocked refrigerator and provides a variety of teas and coffee. As a guest, you will won 't for nothing and will soon feel like part of the family. Her place has a nice cozy feel that I enjoy! I would highly recommend Mardee's place to others visiting the area!"
613020,20650040,2014-10-03,9315663,Gail,"Mardee was there to meet us when we arrived, and to chat for a while. She offered lots of information for getting around Seattle. We enjoyed staying at her place--the beds were very comfortable and the room had a cozy feel. One evening, we took the water taxi from Seattle to Vashon Island, enjoyed the Mexican Restaurant there, then caught the ferry back to Fauntleroy. It made a nice round trip.
"

She was very respectful of our privacy and was very helpful with directions and recommendations. Her house is in a very quiet West Seattle neighborhood and the view from the deck is fantastic. Close to Lincoln park and Alki Beach... good places to eat/drink nearby. The bus to downtown Seattle is only a couple blocks away and comes every 15 minutes. I would highly recommend her room and definitely stay again the next time in Seattle.

She was an exceptional host. Although we stayed at her place, it was almost like she was non-existent- in a good way. She would occasionally check on us to see if we needed anything but other than that, we felt more than welcome to come and go as we pleased. The place was nice, the view was amazing, and the host was exceptional. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends who are thinking about visiting Seattle. Thanks for the place, Mardee!"

There was a good selection of light breakfast foods and if you want something heavier, Endolyne Joe's is literally a stones throw away. The view was beautiful and the neighborhood quiet. It certainly is a great place to get away from the bustle of the city. Sadly, there were some communication difficulties but Mardee went out of her way to be sure that was rectified. I would stay there again and recommend it for sure!"
613020,28748878,2015-03-29,6229820,Haiying (David),"My wife and I visited Seattle last week. It was a great experience exploring Seattle while staying at Mardee's house.

The bathroom was lovely and with shelves with any kind of supply one could need. The twin beds were wonderful - luxurious sheets and cozy bedding, luggage racks and even some hanging space In closet, a TV with numerous channels, WI fi, a desk, good lighting everywhere including reading lights beside beds. And best of all, her home is in a beautiful upscale neighborhood with landscaping to die for. The view from the deck to which we had access was unbelievably gorgeous And with table and chairs.   It was obvious that she loves hosting and had put a lot of thought into arranging the room and equipped it well. "

The views from the deck were as exactly as shown in the site photos, we relaxed with a tea or a beer watching the ferries come and go. Mardee's is well placed to get to the CBD (pikes market etc) via the bus 2 blocks away. It was also an easy drive to the city and no problem parking at Mardees with her visitors permit. Also walking distance to shops and bakery serving the best coffee we could find in the US. Whilst I went to various aircraft Museums Mardee took my wife shopping and had coffee. If we ever manage to get back to Seattle Mardee's is where we will hard for."
613020,39005439,2015-07-20,33142889,Erika,"Mardee was very warm and friendly both in her messaging and in person. She made sure to confirm dates and times with us so that she could be there to meet us when we arrived. The house is lovely and the view is exactly as pictured! There is a lovely park (Lincoln) on the water just a half mile down the road, and the house is also very close to the bus line to downtown. Traffic from the Fauntleroy ferry is usually smooth, but can be a little unruly sometimes, so check the alternate routes to the house just in case. 

Mardee showed us the room and it was clear she had taken great care to think of everything we might need! She provided fruit, coffee, tea, water, and a host of breakfast items. There were also maps, tourist brochures, and bus schedules. The room was well-organized for someone traveling either for business or pleasure. The complimentary Wi-fi connection and password were easy to locate and the room was complete with several power sources. The room was clean and tidy, and Mardee explained storage options, as well as where extra supplies could be found. 

She was a wonderful host, able to answer questions about navigating to downtown and places to eat, and added such a personal touch to everything! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would highly recommend this location."
613020,39267278,2015-07-22,29893885,Sherri,"Mardee welcomed us with some tea and was such a gracious host. The view from her roof deck is beautiful. The room was very cozy and much better than staying in a hotel. She had everything we could possibly need! It was very quiet and comfortable, we slept great. Her house is a 5 minute walk to the bus line or ferries so we didn't have to drive into the city, what a bonus.  "
613020,39761299,2015-07-26,33974448,Xiaodong,"Thanks Mardee for great hosting! we enjoyed a lot for clean room and good advice for city from Mardee, hope we could visit you again!"
613020,40222230,2015-07-29,16437027,Daniel,"A great location in a quiet neighborhood. The view was nice from the deck. Lincoln park is within walking distance as is the bus station and ferry. The two twin bed setup is nice; one firm, one soft. The low ceiling was never an issue."
613020,40589310,2015-08-01,6506608,Michelle,"Stay here! It's our 3rd time so I have nothing but praise for Mardee and her cozy studio. You feel like family here, that's why we keep coming back. The location is perfect for exploring  Seattle & surrounding area ( like Alki beach), quiet, beautiful, safe neighborhood.  Clean well appointed room, just as described.  Mardee respects your privacy but is available if needed & willing to help with any suggestions."
613020,42651292,2015-08-15,1201725,Madeleine & John,"We loved staying staying at this place, everything was provided ample breakfast, cosy beds and privacy. Mardee was a great host and spent a lot if time on her top deck watching the great view having some great conversation 
This place is about 20min bus ride to the city costing $5 return trip and the bus stop is a few min walk from the house If you want to hire a car Enterprise Car hire is around 8min drive but they will pick you up at the house. If you have a few days a great place to go is the Boeing Factory guided tour appox 2hrs it was very interesting and there are a lot of quaint villages you can go after the tour which are on the way home. Great place highly recommended"
2898401,15072992,2014-07-01,16066084,Pamela,"The apartment and the location was awesome. I came into Seattle for Pride and I was around the corner from it all in Capitol Hill. New up level building, great brand new cafe and bar right next store so I could get coffee at 6am.  Amit was a vanishing host. Didn't really meet him but for a few minutes, but I got everything  I needed from him through responsive emails. Gym in the building too, but I didn't see it. Thank you Amit for a lovely stay."
2898401,16131771,2014-07-22,16465123,Nathan,Excellent host in an excellent location. The apartment was very nice.
2898401,16505904,2014-07-28,17948383,Sarah,I had a great experience with the host and his home. The location was amazing--right in the heart of Capitol Hill. The apartment was clean and spacious. I would definitely stay here again! 
2898401,17399147,2014-08-11,9102088,James,"Our stay with Amit was great. The apartment was clean, modern, spacious and conveniently located. We'd definitely consider staying here again. "
2898401,18272262,2014-08-24,834185,Zachary,Place is in a nice location and the apartment is as advertised -- great building too and a nice gym with a cool little cafe next door.
2898401,18736793,2014-08-31,19139603,Michael,"Seattle: I honestly didn't stay much at the apartment, but I can say it's an incredibly nice building in the perfect part of town. You can easily walk everywhere in Capitol Hill yet you're surrounded by suburbia and a park, so you've always got a quiet home base to come back to. Amit gave me exactly what I was looking for. He responded quickly and clearly and there was no hassle whatsoever. Definitely recommended."
2898401,19559946,2014-09-14,13304074,Haley,"A wonderful place to stay for our first time in Seattle! The apartment is spacious and clean, and its location is fantastic with a lot of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Amit was a very accommodating host, giving us a flexible checkout time and answering our questions quickly. "
2898401,20325262,2014-09-27,5191281,Eric,"Amit's place was perfect. The energy was good. No bad vibes whatsoever. Everything that you need is right outside of his door. Bars,gym,restaurants and buses. I honestly didn't do much but sleep and leave off to work or sightseeing. If I wanted to stay, there was everything that I needed in the apt. Amit was very accommodating even though he was literally going out the door to travel himself. I contacted him just 3 hours before I was to arrive and before he was to leave. He totally accommodated me... and with joy he did it. Thank you again Amit. I look forward to staying with you again in the near future!"
2898401,21927671,2014-10-26,22814326,Todd,"This apartment is very centrally located on Capitol Hill, only one block off Broadway. It's in a nice neighborhood, in an upscale complex with a nice gym and lounge. "
2898401,22557970,2014-11-09,5177095,Zohra,"Amit's place was awesome! It's located in the middle of Capitol Hill pretty close to Broadway, so everything was within walking distance. It was about 1.5 miles or less to walk down to Pike Place Market and everything else in Downtown/City Center. There's also public transport, of course. His place was really clean and in a nice (and what appears to be fairly new) building, and he went out of his way to find a place to leave his key for us since we were getting in so late! He was really easy to reach and would respond within an hour or so. Definitely would stay at his place again on my next trip to Seattle! P.S. Lots of good coffee everywhere, but definitely try Vivace...just a walk down Broadway."
2898401,24236287,2014-12-23,13859409,Sarah,"This apartment is in a nice building in a great location. It is one bedroom and a den with one bath, so I can't imagine 6 people would be possible. We were 3, but each needed our own bed and the host's answer was to put a mattress on the floor in the den (fine) and one on the floor in the main room (pretty awful, as it obstructed the sofa and table both). So, would really only consider this apartment if you just require 2 beds. 
The host clearly lives here. Personal items (such as bathrobe, toiletries, bath sponge) were all left out- you feel as you're truely staying in someone's home. He has nice cookware and appliances. The coffee maker is nespresso so you're out of luck unless you bring in your own pods or a drip maker of your own. 
The ad said laundry was available, but we couldn't figure out where (certainly not in the apartment).
Not the best organized Airbnb rental we've had: We couldn't figure out internet, and the host replied back to my query at 11:47 PM the first night we were there (waking me) with the network name & password. We never did figure out where the trash chute was. We were given only one key (despite requesting 2 or 3) so the logistics were tough when we each went our own way. Overall the apartment met our needs ok, and the location was great."
2898401,24429054,2014-12-28,24300746,Shane,The neighborhood was great. Very centrally located to the sites and food and drink. The building had great rooftop views. The apartment was clean. Amit had Chromecast which he let us connect to which was a nice perk. 
2898401,24972248,2015-01-04,7320855,Ryan,"The apartment was lovely! Spotless and comfortable in a luxury building, located in the heart of Capitol Hill. The key exchange was very easy, and everything was exactly as advertized. Amit responded to any communication very promptly and was always gracious and accommodating. I'd recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Seattle. "
2898401,38922044,2015-07-19,36982014,Allison,"The apartment was nice and the location was fantastic. The apartment looked clean, but it also  looked like someone had just left the apartment before I arrived. The sheets on the bed looked like they hadn't been changed...the sheets were wrinkled and looked as if someone slept in the bed the night before. The bed was also poorly made. I had to contact Amit to find clean sheets and change the bed myself! There were also used towels hanging in bathroom. Amit assured me the maid was in before me, but I'm not so sure. Amit was very easy to contact and responded quickly, so that I appreciated. I also couldn't figure out the TV, but that wasn't the biggest deal as I mostly used the apartment just to sleep. Overall, my stay wasn't bad and it was well priced, but I'm so/so if I'd stay again. "
2898401,39438815,2015-07-23,38278246,Victoria,"Amit's apartment was clean and welcoming.  Although the kitchen was only stocked with minimal cookware, the beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of fresh towels.  The windows next to the dining table overlook the street and provided so much light that we only turned the bathroom light on!  Location on Capitol Hill was great with cafes, shops, well known restaurants, and a grocery store within walking distance."
2898401,39992827,2015-07-27,13651174,Amy,"This apartment was my first stay with airbnb. I was not disappointed and rave to everyone I know about the experience. This apartment looks as good, or better than the pictures. I was able to obtain the keys as described. The apartment is very clean and the building was new and secure. Amenities are nice, and I fell in love with the iron. Parking is a little tricky, it is in a great location so you really don't need one. There is not anything negative I can say about the apartment, the price was very reasonable, the location and furnishings felt luxury."
2898401,40361327,2015-07-30,37832696,Gabe,"Amit made my trip up to Seattle wonderful. The apartment is exactly as pictured. It's in a luxurious building equipped with a gym, which I didn't have time to explore among many other communal amenities. Within the apartment, there is a full kitchen, living/dining room area, washer and dryer, large bath in the master bathroom, and spacious bedroom. The apartment building itself is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, a great neighborhood for people who love good restaurants and bars. This is definitely a great find for its price."
2898401,40706857,2015-08-02,17848341,Brady,"Amit's luxurious building is very conveniently located in Capital Hill.  We took the Link from the airport to downtown Seattle ($3 each), and an Uber to the apartment ($8 total). There are so many bars, restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores surrounding this prime location. The walk down to the Pike Place Market was a pleasant 20-25 minute downhill walk (Uber back up the hill was only $8). 

The building itself has an amazing rooftop patio with stunning 360 degree views. The apartment was very clean and the bed itself was very comfortable. This house also has central AC which is rare for this area and was definitely a plus during our late July weekend stay. Thanks again Amit!"
2898401,42989639,2015-08-16,33771623,Matthew,"Amit has a wonderful place and made us feel super welcome. The apartment was clean, spacious, and well decorated! I currently live on Capitol Hill and this is ground zero of all the action to say the least! We had a blast and would definitely re-book with Amit for another stay at his gorgeous apartment. "
2898401,46979287,2015-09-14,8126164,Rochelle,"Amit was a fantastic host. He was very accommodating and the location was amazing. Nearly everything was within walking distance and there was no shortage of fun activities, bars, and restaurants. We had a great time and I'd recommend this place to all of my friends without hesitation. "
2898401,48814259,2015-09-28,3638269,Stefan,"The condo was great... One of the better experiences on Airbnb.

Things to Know:
1) It's in a semi luxurious apartment complex. Give it 4 stars.
2) Location, Location, Location! A+ Not only can you walk to downtown and Pike Market (about 1.2mi) but you can also walk around the neighborhood. (You've probably noticed I like to walk way too much) 
3) Miscellaneous: There is some really good restaurant in the area open late. Bring your laptop & Stream: You can also use the Host's Google TV to stream and watch movies from your computer. "
1974131,9044582,2013-12-02,8900892,Aina,"My friends and I stayed at Scooter's Spacious Sutdio on Capitol HIll over Thanksgiving break 2013 and we had a great experience. The space is really well taken care of; the decorations, the photgrahpy books, art works... it felt really nice and cozy; and everything was impecable and very clean. The studio itself is big, the kitchen has everything you can wish for, and so does the bathroom (laundry on site, claw foot bath tub, hair dryer...) very comfy couches and a brand new HD TV... everything a traveller or visitor might need. But the best part of our AirBnB exprience in this place was meeting the landlord, Scooter. He is really nice and kind, and takes good care of his guests and his space; Scooter gave us a ton of recommendations and tips, and was always willing to help us feel comfortable. He even was so kind to leave us some tea and coffee, and bread and fruit in the kitchen for us, which was very convenient beacuse we came in late. I am glad we weere his first guests and I am sure future guests will have a very positive exprience too."
1974131,9300471,2013-12-19,247975,Kevin And Monica,"Wow! What a Fantastic Airbnb experience in Seattle!  Scooter's studio is even better than described. It's warm and quiet with high ceilings and a private entrance. It's also full of thoughtful touches, such as high-quality furniture and comfy mattresses, colorful and happy artwork, an HD TV, a full-sized fridge....  

The studio's in a great location. Scooter was gracious enough to supply a parking pass strictly for guests(!), but the next time we stay, we won't bring a car at all. We walked 1 block to get our morning coffee, one block to get to the grocery store, a couple of blocks to have a happy hour drink, and maybe 3 blocks for dinner.  It's obvious that Capitol Hill is a thriving and hip neighborhood in Seattle, and Scooter's apartment is right in the thick of things.  We wanted an urban hike, and we walked to Pike Place Market without too much trouble. It was an easy bus ride back up the hill. 

Thanks so much for the getaway, Scooter! We'll be back!"
1974131,9399277,2013-12-26,4870240,Tracy,"Scooter graciously turned his beautiful basement into a photo studio to do product photography for IMPWEAR!  Such a talented and attentive fellow.  it was delightful.  Thank you, Scooter!
"
1974131,9450249,2013-12-29,1249278,David,"Scooter was a terrific host. The studio was very large, beautiful and and comfortable. Scooter went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. He texted us to check and to see if we needed anything and even stocked the kitchen with some staples in case we didn't have time to food shop. Scooter's house is in a great part of town with loads of restaurants and he was very knowledgeable about the area and had many suggestions. When we are back in Seattle we will definitely stay with him again! "
1974131,9605689,2014-01-03,9439983,Mackenzie,"This was a great first airbnb experience! Scooter was organized, attentive, helpful--he obviously wanted us to enjoy our stay. He was in contact before and during our stay to make sure all went swimmingly. The attention was a nice addition to the great studio. 
The studio itself well decorated and bigger than I expected.  It was well-lit despite being on the basement level, and quiet even though below Scooter's home. There were comfy couches and an open kitchen, as well as a fun bath/shower. The rest of the house is beautiful, and the neighborhood is packed with restaurants, bars, parks, and views. They also have a parking pass, so you don't have to worry about moving your car every two hours if you're taking Seattle on foot. 
Really good find in my favorite area of Seattle--would definitely recommend!"
1974131,9743259,2014-01-07,598661,Calvin,"Scooter's suite is private, spacious (actually huge), beautiful, and in a really fantastic location.  It's a perfect example of why Airbnb > hotels... this suite is 10x better than any hotel, and comes with a super gracious, thoughtful host.  My highest recommendations to this suite!  We had a wonderful time."
1974131,9868422,2014-01-15,4027646,Agatha,"This was a very clean, beautifully furnished/ decorated place, with all of the amenities you could possibly need.  I stayed here by myself and felt very safe and comfortable.  Scooter and Tim really made me feel at home.  I'll probably only stay here when in Seattle, in the future.  SUPER! 10/10 "
1974131,9954300,2014-01-21,285219,Christie,"Scooter was an AMAZING host and the accommodations were perfect! While it has a fairly open floor plan, there was plenty of space for me and the two friends who stayed there, and we loved having a cozy place to relax between outings around the city. The icing on the cake was our host Scooter, who helped us feel comfortable, told us great places to check out in the neighborhood and truly made our stay memorable. Would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone I know visiting Seattle."

1974131,10301170,2014-02-11,5270813,Joe,"Scooter and his suite embody everything I love about AirBnB: a super-friendly, gracious, considerate and funny host, providing a unique place that's packed with personality. I loved everything about it, from the quirky aesthetic (I miss waking up to that incredible pop-art wall mural) to the convenient location (near great coffee, bookstores, tea shops and restaurants). The next time I'm coming to Seattle, I'll make sure to stay at Scooter's place again!"
1974131,10421884,2014-02-18,11063644,Tony,"The Spectacular Suite On Capitol Hill is a wonderful place to stay while you are in Seattle. The combination of a great host, a great location and a beautiful apartment cannot be beat. The apartment is spotless and as an aside I meant to ask Scooter how he got his cast iron skillet so perfectly oiled. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen fully equipped and there is even a washer and dryer available. There is a food co-op a few blocks away and you are only one block away from some really nice restaurants. It is an easy walk to downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market. If you are not a walker there are two bus lines within a block and they run about every 12 minutes.  You do not need a car to get around. My wife and I will definitely stay at Spectacular Suite again when we get back to Seattle. My only fear is that once word spreads about what a great place this is stay, Spectacular Suite will be booked solid."
1974131,10531714,2014-02-24,3483152,Vance,"Scooter was an amazing host the spot was clean, comfortable and charming/funky.  The location was great, walking distance to many fantastic local shops, restaurants and bars.  Hands down the best Airbnb in Capitol Hill"
1974131,10610742,2014-02-27,12405422,Kerri,"This listing was everything I expected and more! Scooter is very friendly and accommodating. As a female travelling alone I felt safe and secure. I would not hesitate to refer anyone to this lovely home in Capitol Hill, Seattle. 

Capitol Hill is perfect! Such a beautiful area to stay in. Conveniences right around the corner whether it be Starbucks, Restaurants, Cafés and flower shops. Bus stop right at the end of the street with easy access to other areas of the city. 

I loved the set up of the studio. Very spacious and neat/tidy. I knew I could call on Scooter if I had any concerns but also felt like my privacy was respected:) I will definitely be back to visit!"
1974131,10677369,2014-03-03,10971094,A. Minetta,"Scooter is a fantastic host and has set up a beautiful, spacious apartment for his guests. He's very accommodating, going as far as allowing an early check in time and texting during my stay to make sure I was finding everything ok. It immediately felt like I was staying with a friend; his charm and the way his personality shines in the space feels like a home. Oh, and his dog, Bart, is the greatest little 'hello' and 'goodbye' watching through their front window ;) I highly recommend this stay and hope that whenever I need time in Seattle again that this space is available. "
1974131,10801751,2014-03-08,6049212,Madeleine,"Our experience at Scooter's Dreampop Studio surpassed any AirBnB experience we have had thus far. It was honestly one of our favorite parts about visiting Seattle. No, not the Space Needle or Pike Place; instead, it was the amazing suite we got to occupy in Capitol Hill, coupled with gracious hosts and a friendly dog. From our arrival to departure, Scooter was there to help us all along. He showed us around the meticulously-planned suite—it's expansive floor plan, stocked kitchen, comfortable lounge area, and black book with everything you would need to know about his space and traveling in Seattle. On our last night, Scooter and Tim even invited us out to dinner/drinks and we had such a great time with them. We can't say enough about this wonderful place and we can't thank Scooter and Tim enough for being awesome. We can't wait to return!

P.S. Don't forget to sign their guestbook!"
1974131,10838163,2014-03-10,11361085,Jane,"Not only is it a Spectacular Suite, but it offers a Spectacular Stay!
We were in town for the weekend to visit our daughter, who lives in the Capitol Hill area. Scooter is gracious and helpful and fun to talk with. He met us at the gate of his lovely older home and gave us a tour of the suite: large area with full kitchen, sitting area, dining table, queen bed, full bath, heated wood floor, and cool art. There's a private entrance, with a coat rack and several umbrellas thoughtfully provided. It's downstairs -- a fully finished basement -- so you do occasionally heard footsteps or his cute terrier scrabbling about or barking upstairs, but it's a pretty quiet atmosphere.
We went out to eat and walked the neighborhood on Friday. The next day, we used a crockpot and groceries we had packed to simmer a stew while we dodged lots of raindrops, then spent the night in. We turned off all the lights and played board games (our daughter's and the suite's Scrabble) under the suite's disco ball -- I had thought it was just decoration but it works! The next morning, Scooter checked on us and said goodbye as he headed out, letting us know we didn't have to be in any hurry to check out.
This was a great place to stay and we'll definitely use it again.

1974131,10914351,2014-03-12,12796823,Jeff,Scooter was great! The place was very clean and charming. I would definitely stay here again. A+!

1974131,11006527,2014-03-17,11722090,James & Michael,"Scooter and his partner were the greatest hosts.  They made our trip to Seattle so much more enjoyable.  The mini tour of the neighborhood shops and restaurants made us feel right at home on the first day.   The suite was awesome, can't wait to go back there!!  The neighborhood is gorgeous and great for walking and running.

Thanks Scooter for providing such a wonderful experience.    "
1974131,11111341,2014-03-21,2669589,Lazar,"Scooter wins the best apartment and best host award hands down, out of 20+ apartments that we collectively stayed through Airbnb.  Scooter takes immense pride and pleasure in what he does and is a wonderfully, genial person. When we arrived he was able to give us a tour of the apartment and the 'hood, introducing us to his acquaintances and showing us the best places to eat at.  Do not take this for granted, as the stars have really aligned on the tour. The location is great, a quiet residential picturesque street, two blocks from the bus and great coffeehouses and restaurants. The apartment was amazing and we truly felt that we were guests. Spacious and well laid out.  Nothing was worn and everything was ultra clean.  Personal touches were seen throughout in forms of posters and art work.  Keep up the great work Scooter!"
1974131,11152341,2014-03-23,6093098,Lauren,We had a great time at Scooter's. He was very accommodating and helpful and just had one of those personalities that make us love airbnb. 
1974131,11242316,2014-03-26,6041543,Sarah,"My daughter and I had a wonderful experience at Scooter's airbnb.  The studio apartment was roomy and comfortable.  The decor was fun and there was everything we would have ever needed to be right at home. The house is in beautiful Capitol Hill just steps from restaurants , shops and bus stops.  Scooter was very hospitable and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed.
"
1974131,11395464,2014-04-01,3742262,Tony,"A fantastic stay! You could not possibly meet a friendlier or more helpful host. The house is lovely - exactly as advertised. Very spacious, very comfortable. The neighbourhood is excellent, with loads of great amenities near by (nice croissants at the bakery just south of the Safeway), and the closest bus gets you downtown quickly.
If you have a car, only street parking is available and reliably locating a spot can be a bit of a coin toss, a minor issue that Scooter eases with a guest parking pass. I never had so much trouble that it wasn't solved by a quick lap around the block.
Whatever you do, DO NOT ignore Scooter's recommendation of The Wandering Goose. It is magnificent."
1974131,11489655,2014-04-05,1930834,John,Scooter's place is a great place to stay in Seattle. Terrific location in Capitol Hill in a nice quiet neighborhood and walking distance to a vibrant dining/shopping scene. Was very easy to travel to downtown and all the touristy sites as the bus stop was literally 1/2 block away. The space itself is very nice with all the needed amenities. Scooter has great attention to detail and is a very personable host. Couldn't ask for a nicer guy and to top it off he has a really adorable dog (Bart). Would definitely stay again next time in town.
1974131,11549229,2014-04-07,12321654,Jason,"Scooter was a great host! Very welcoming and told us all the cool places to go in the neighborhood. Speaking of the neighborhood, if you like amazing turn of the century victorian houses on tree lined streets then this is the place to stay. "
1974131,11687002,2014-04-12,1611150,Carol,"Scooter and his huge studio were even better than the description and photos and reviews!   Delightful, quiet space with thoughtful touches for the guests, and so convenient for zipping downtown and to city center on the buses.  Thanks Scooter and Bart."
1974131,11829505,2014-04-16,12121552,Leslie,"Scooter was a great host, very friendly and helpful. The studio apartment was comfortable and very spacious.  The place is very clean.

The neighborhood is fantastic. The location is a quiet residential street, but just one block from great restaurants, cafés and shops. If you are cooking in the full kitchen, there is a full Safeway grocery store just a block away.

"
1974131,12048562,2014-04-22,5816777,Lucy,We had such a lovely time at Scooter's place. He's a kind and knowledgeable host and the space is well-equipped and comfortable. The local area has nice bars and restaurants but is also well-connected to the rest of the city. Five stars!
1974131,12154340,2014-04-24,1017939,Chris,"Scooters place was the perfect start to our road trip. Spacious, fun and the neighborhood is amazing.

A great host, welcoming, thoughtful and he even took us out for breakfast and gave us some quarters for the bus!!!

Can't recommend enough!!!"
1974131,12218346,2014-04-26,3137026,Heba & Jacob,"Sorry it took a while to write this! We loved our stay at this beautiful home. The space was really enjoyable to spend time in. It is big, comfortable, interesting (art and books ) and cozy. It is a quiet space which is nice to find in the city. Scooter is an awesome host- he even took me for a little walk around the neighborhood to get acquainted. We enjoyed eating at a couple of the nearby spots and found it easy to get around. Would definitely recommend this suite!"
1974131,12282062,2014-04-28,3777821,Glenn,"Mr. Scooter was a dream host, so accommodating and friendly. His home is beautiful, the neighborhood divine, and the hospitality unsurpassed. I'd recommend his home to anyone interested in seeing the BEST side of Seattle."
1974131,12498768,2014-05-04,1588109,John,"Great spot. Beautiful home. Very comfortable space with all amenities. Scooter was on his honeymoon, but his friend Jeff took very good care of us including letting us know the apartment was available to check in early. Good restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. If you are a walker, you can pretty much access the entire city from capitol hill. Thanks for a great stay. 
"
1974131,12713089,2014-05-09,6771972,Kristin,"We stayed at Scooter's for five nights -- our first visit ever to Seattle -- and it was a delightful base for each day's adventures.  We were intrigued by the photos and description, but the reality far exceeded our expectations.  There is a delightful and campy sense of humor in the decor that kept us smiling throughout our visit.  The thoughtful attention to detail was much appreciated and the overall layout was more spacious than we had expected.  In Scooter's absence, Jeff took great care of us and we especially appreciated that morning cup of freshly brewed coffee our last morning before heading out on a long drive south.  The neighborhood is fabulous with a least five great coffee shops within a two block walk (we tried a different one each morning!), wonderful homes and gardens to walk (or jog) past and marvel at, and easy access to everywhere we wanted to go. Highly recommended for anyone who hates the cookie cutter hotel experience!"
1974131,12820560,2014-05-12,3310253,Jane,"Went out here for our honeymoon for a couple days. Great centrally located place to stay!  It was a very comfortable, clean & has all the amenities you need.  Right around the corner (literally) to restaurants & stores.  Minutes from downtown.  Scooter was on his honeymoon also, but his friend Jeff & his cute little dog Bart took great care of us!  Would definitely stay here again!  5 stars! "
1974131,12975992,2014-05-16,9652579,Jack,"This studio is in a nice neighborhood. There are many restaurants, grocery stores, shops around. 
We did not take bus, rather than used uber. Drivers are friendly around here. 
We like the decoration of the studio. Studio is quite spacious. 
The only concern I had was that the studio is half basement. So there was a smell when you enter the studio. "
1974131,13133934,2014-05-20,12433943,Lacey,"Wow wow wow! Scooter has such an incredible place that no bed and breakfast or upscale hotel could even compare to.  So lively, so much character,  very welcoming and many personal touches. I really appreciated the homemade welcome sign on the fridge for us.  Jeff and bart were our gracious hosts for our stay and we're very accommodating to our unusual requests. This suite is located in a prime area in Seattle with so much to do within walking distance, this was a huge plus for me.  Jeff also provided us with a parking pass for our entire stay and recommended where to park in the neighborhood.  The neighborhood itself is beautiful and quiet. One street up is literally a row of bars and places to eat. A huge bonus for us was the washer and dryer in the unit.  We had done a multi city road trip staying at airbnb places and the last place we stayed at did not have a washer and dryer so needless to say it was a big help.  I really liked the idea of a keyless entry.  The studio uses a keypad with a code so no losing keys or anything like that.  There is a separate entrance to the studio as well so we did not have to worry about disturbing anyone or waking anyone up.  I almost forgot to mention the beautiful fir wood floors that are heated!  Yes,  you read that right. The linens were like a shabby chic motif and were nice and cozy at night. In the bathroom there  were some awesome amenities; hello Prada bath salts?! Super soft cotton towels and hot water that never ran out. The kitchen has cabinetry that is right out of a magazine stocked with whatever you need.  Coffee? It's there.  Some EVOO? Check. Butter? In the fridge. A wine bottle opener because you forgot yours in Portland? Yeah that's there too. But the whole place just has this ""Hey come in and hang out we can be cool and fabulous together"" vibe. It's sweetly and artistically lighthearted. I loved all the original Seattle posters; everywhere you look in the studio there is something to look at. Whether it be the disco ball or the African mask or the mannequin. It is quite the conversation piece!   We were able to come and go as we pleased.  I will definitely be staying at Scooters again when we come back to Seattle.  Stay fabulous Seattle."
1974131,13218678,2014-05-22,14619457,Gretchen,Thanks for having us Scooter and Jeff (not to mention Bart). Capitol Hill is an awesome location with a great sense of community. Jeff was helpful with local info and great communication prior to arriving. Thanks again
1974131,13469412,2014-05-28,12648800,Rachel,"Scooter and the Dreampop studio were wonderful!! The studio is exactly as described and was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was on a beautiful neighborhood street just blocks away from amazing restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. We had 3 people staying and it was a great size for us. It was so nice to have a full kitchen to cook up some breakfast before going out on the town. Scooter and his dog, Bart, greeted us even though we arrived late and showed us around, gave us some recommendations for food places and was amazingly friendly throughout the whole stay. He even let us keep our rented bikes in his garage! I would highly recommend Scooter's studio and would love to stay again! "
1974131,13566457,2014-05-31,13523505,Priscilla,"This private suite was wonderfully decorated and really comfortable.  The house and yard are charming.  It is located in a well established, walkable neighborhood.  It is close to stores, restaurants, and a community park.  It's a fun walk (a couple miles) down the hill to the waterfront and all its attractions.  (Take mass transit back up!)  The host is a really nice guy: full of information about Seattle's happenings and fun to talk to.  We will come back to stay again and again. "
1974131,13812544,2014-06-05,12719653,Gernot,"This is an outstanding location with a very nice and supportive host. There is a lot of space in the studio, including a large and well-appointed kitchen. Everything is clean and nice, a perfect place to relax after exhaustive city trips.
As an introduction to the neighborhood, Scooter took us to a couple of cafés, restaurants and shops, the best welcome you can get. This is a quiet and relaxed area with a distance to Seattle Center and Downtown of only 10 to 15 minutes by bus.
We were comfortable from the first minute in Scooter's 'Dreampop Studio' :-)"
1974131,14122393,2014-06-12,9747641,Christy,"We had a wonderful stay at Scooter's.  His place is located in a nice and quiet area close to everything you need for your stay, including one of the best bakeries in town which we loved within minutes away on foot.  If you want to find out which bakery it is, you will need to reserve Scooter's place!  :-)  Besides that we appreciate Scooter's accommodation and hospitality greatly.  Thank you for making our stay so comfortable!"
1974131,14222080,2014-06-15,13061104,Jeanna,We had an outstanding stay at dreampop studio. This studio is very spacious and is a great location close to public transit. We really enjoyed all the little details that made this place unique like the coffee mugs from local places around the neighborhood and browsing the local magazines. The neighborhood itself is very walkable and easy to navigate. Scooter greeted us on arrival and checked in frequently during our trip while still giving us privacy. Could not have asked for a better host or place to rest after exploring the city! We would def. stay again when visiting Seattle!
1974131,14423116,2014-06-19,11464317,Kate,"My parents stayed at Scooter's apartment during two different time periods, broken up by a family trip in between. Scooter was really accommodating to make this happen. The apartment is really neat and clean, and my parents liked it. The neighborhood was perfect for my parents because there's all kinds of entertainment and transportation a block away. Beautiful and fun location!"
1974131,14505968,2014-06-21,13276115,Adam,"Had a great stay for 2 nights,many thanks   
Adam & Kim"
1974131,14598469,2014-06-23,3355626,Julia,"We had an absolute fabulous stay! Scooter was incredibly inviting, taking us on a walking tour of the neighborhood and showing us all his favorite spots. It's in a perfect location, we never had to pay for parking and all was ideal.  We walked all over town and it was very easy to get around. You're right off the Main Street in Capitol Hill and the busses are a block away. Would HIGHLY recommend this space and the opportunity to meet Scooter--a lovely host! "
1974131,14769150,2014-06-26,11464317,Kate,"My parents stayed at Scooter's apartment during two different time periods, broken up by a family trip in between.

1974131,15027766,2014-07-01,12303358,Mona,Our host was great - he took us to the local neighborhood and showed us around and introduced us to local business owners.  The accomodations were super clean and comfortable.  It's a safe and serene neighborhood - all a positive experience.
1974131,15135793,2014-07-03,2484635,Kara,"Our stay with Scooter was great! The place was comfortable, spacious, and had everything we needed and then some. We had a short stay but it was nice to have the option of a kitchen with fridge, etc. Scooter was so friendly and great at communicating with us/responsive with answers to any of our questions. Cannot beat the location! We walked to amazing restaurants and found the short bus rides easy to bring us to all the major attractions. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. "
1974131,15387467,2014-07-08,5413939,Melissa,"This place was amazing! Everything was as depicted in the listing, and the place could not have been in a more convenient neighborhood. Everything was clean when we arrived, and Scooter came out to greet us and go over any questions we had. He even walked up the street with us to introduce us to a hostess at a close restaurant where we had an excellent meal after our very long flight. There was plenty of info at the place to help us with planning our days in Seattle. We were super comfortable here, and would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
1974131,15569266,2014-07-12,530799,Ro,"Staying at Scooter's place was a highlight of our USA/Canada holiday. Scooter is an outstanding host. He is a very professional host and has set up a wonderful studio apartment which has everything a traveler could want in terms of facilities, not to mention an excellent location with many options for transport, places to eat and amenities. The apartment is well appointed, welcoming and comfortable. However, it's Scooter's innate warmth and desire to welcome people to his neighborhood that are so wonderful. He took the time to personally tour with us through the neighborhood, introducing us to many of the local business owners and giving us all the highlights of the area and how to get around and see the best of Seattle. We  loved Scooter (not to mention Bart!) and felt his love and enthusiasm for Seattle without it being intrusive. We would recommend Scooter's place to anyone who wants to have a fantastic time in Seattle."
1974131,16074580,2014-07-22,12311805,Belinda,"Scooter was beyons compare!  He checked on me every day as I was traveling alone.  He helped me get an ORCA card so that I could gey around town by bus and made good recommendations of places to visit while here.  He was va very good host.
"
1974131,16650068,2014-07-31,12481389,Chris,"Scooter your a great host you went out of the way to meet any of our needs
your reference books are great tool to any one who stays at the apartment
We enjoy your our stay and look forward to another stay
Give Bart a warm hug for me

1974131,16971956,2014-08-05,8920845,Matthew,"Couldn't have asked for a comfortable and welcoming Capitol Hill crash pad! In addition to an A+ location (nice and close to 15th Ave.), the studio itself was a lovely and comfortable spot to sprawl out and relax during down time;   a cool little subterranean hideaway during summertime hot spells. Scooter truly set the bar high for our first Airbnb experience - we were really struck by the careful balance of privacy and attentiveness. He nailed it. Big thumbs up. "
1974131,17142377,2014-08-08,2054780,Ethan,"Scooter is a great host that makes any guest in his home feel welcome.  He goes out of his way to ensure his guests are comfortable as well as to give insider information about whatever his guests are interested in doing while in town. Immediately he took us on a walking tour to give us a feel for his neighborhood.  The area is great - it offers many places to eat, drink, walk, and explore.  Scooter also lent us a bus pass so that we could maneuver around Seattle easily without having to worry about driving a car. His studio is very comfortable and just as described.  We were even able to take advantage of an in unit laundry machine. When traveling back to Seattle, we will definitely try to stay at Scooter's studio again.  This has been our best Airbnb experience, yet."
1974131,17267886,2014-08-10,14811015,Lina,"Scooter was great and the home was wonderful to stay in! Scooter was very welcoming and gave us a tour of the neighborhood when we first came in. It was our first time visiting Seattle and Scooter was great about giving suggestions for places to visit. Tim and Bart were so friendly too!

The suite was very similar to what is described, no surprises there. I stayed there with my parents and it was more than enough room for us - a fun and clean space to stay. Also, the location was very convenient. Only a block from the two buses that can take you straight into the center of downtown Seattle (about a 20 minute bus ride). 

Overall, we had a great experience here. Would absolutely recommend it for anybody traveling to Seattle. "
1974131,17741025,2014-08-17,13290366,Maria,"Scooter is the warmest, kindest, most delightful host imaginable! He made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, and all throughout our week-long stay. We are a family with a 9-year-old and a 16-year-old, and the sleeping arrangements were fine for us. The basement-level studio is in the lovely, very convenient Capitol Hill neighborhood: it is easy to get everywhere. I know Seattle and didn't need to ask for all the recommendations and advice he would have been clearly happy to give. I will certainly consider staying with Scooter again, next time I come to Seattle with my family! Thank you so much, Scooter!"
1974131,17922638,2014-08-19,10872664,Erika,"Everything they say about Scooter is true! :) He made us feel immediately at home in Seattle, and the clean, spacious, comfortable accommodations with many small, special touches, made his place the favorite of our 3 week airbnb-filled vacation. Loved it! "
1974131,18227917,2014-08-24,13616647,David,"Scooter is someone who's proud of his neighborhood, and rightly so. It turned out, that a lot of the places we were excited to visit were a stone's throw away. Scooter couldn't have been a more gracious host. He was always there to help with any questions we had (his response time must be the fastest on AirBnB). There was a lot of thought that went into the immaculately kept space, replete with menus, maps, and a handy guidebook for the studio itself. The warm yellow house on a quiet tree-lined street became a welcomed sight for weary legs, after long walking excursions throughout the city, and daytrips to Yakima and Bainbridge Island. When we were too tired to keep walking, we hopped on one of the many buses that dot the city, all with the Orca card Scooter had kindly prepared for us. There was just so much to do in Seattle, and we couldn't have asked for a better host and launching point to see it all. Highly recommended. "
1974131,18398930,2014-08-26,12340923,Jesse,We LOVED Scooter and his beautiful home! He is so friendly and very welcoming! The neighborhood is right in the middle of Capitol Hill and is close to lots of restaurants and shops! There is also a cute dog named Bart! Thank you Scooter! 
1974131,18522519,2014-08-28,15139948,David,Scooter has set the bar very high for our first Airbnb experience. The accommodations are first class and everything was as described. He is warm and caring person.  It was evident from the moment we arrived.  He took the time to show us the neighborhood and answer any questions we had. Scooters amazing suite is highly recommended!!
1974131,18781998,2014-09-01,953612,Nathalie,"Loved staying at Scooter's place in Capitol Hill! It really was incredibly convenient to get around from the house, with 2 groceries stores & bars/restaurants/bakeries within walking distance and several bus stops to bring you into Downtown and other areas of the Seattle area. Scooter, Tim & Bart were exceptionally welcoming and their studio was comfy and cozy to ""come home"" to after a long day exploring the city. Loved all the thoughtful accommodations around the house-- tea & coffee, eye mask & ear plugs near the bed (although not needed, so quiet!), board games and city guides. "
1974131,18959773,2014-09-03,19977361,Beth,"LOVED staying with Scooter!  He was very warm and friendly- a great host! He was easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to your needs/questions. He was extremely helpful and showed us the neighborhood, best restaurants/coffee shops/bars/stores, he showed us how to get on the bus (what bus to take), and also loaned us a pre-loaded bus card which was extremely helpful. The suite was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our stay including washer/dryer/soap and much more. The kitchen was fully stocked with coffee, tea, filters ect. The house was very quiet and we slept well (even with our 13 month old). we would love to come back! Thank you for a great Seattle experience!"
1974131,19188292,2014-09-08,2140920,Zom,"Scooter is very welcoming and his response to any query was quick and caring. The place is more like an open one bedroom than a studio. There is a lot of space. 
It is in a great location, beautiful tree lined streets yet near to restaurants and shops. Quiet and happening. 
Scooter is very thoughtful about the suite, providing many details such as shampoo, washing detergent, coffee and tea. We would love to stay there again. "
1974131,19409173,2014-09-12,17407696,Michelle,"Scooter was such a wonderful host.  Before our arrival, he sent us a welcoming email with everything we needed to know.  When we arrived, he was so gracious, and soon took us on a tour of the area as an introduction to restaurants, etc.  He also was willing to answer any questions we had about getting around the Seattle area - he is very knowledgeable!  Scooter's suite is amazing - just as described.  It is comfortable (bed and couches), fully stocked, and in the beautiful Capitol Hill area - just a short bus ride or nice walk to Pike Street Market and all the attractions near there. "
1974131,19767064,2014-09-18,14503963,Daniel,"The space was comfortabe, and Scooter was very friendly and accomodating.  This was our first airbnb experience, and it was a good one!"
1974131,19879518,2014-09-20,19599737,Kailey,"Oh Scooter... What can we say about him that hasn't already been said?  Scooter was a phenomenal host and the space was even cooler in person that it looked in the pictures (and that's saying something).  It was immaculate, cozy, and we immediately felt right at home.  The neighborhood was also excellent and Scooter gave us an awesome walking tour- we definitely recommend taking him up on that.  All around an awesome stay with an awesome host!"
1974131,19999600,2014-09-22,14503963,Daniel,"This was the second stage of our stay at this location.  (We spent a night there, then off to Portland for a couple of days and then back for two more nights.)  Scooter was really helpful, friendly, and accommodating; we could not have asked for a better host!"
1974131,20156459,2014-09-24,3563383,Emily,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we absolutely loved it!  Scooter was the best host anyone could ask for!  He was so friendly, helpful, and accommodating - we felt right at home.  He gave us a quick rundown on things to do and how to get around, and even offered to get us a bus pass before our arrival.  We decided to rent a car instead to get around, and it was so nice of him to lend us a parking pass so we could park all day on the street.  The suite was spacious, super cool, clean, quiet, and conveniently located to everything - as described.  We overall had an amazing experience!"
1974131,20228540,2014-09-26,13720483,Renee,Scooter is a wonderful host and his place is great! Very spacious and such a great location - good coffee right around the corner! Buses are super easy to get downtown (Scooter even lent us his bus card to use). He went out of his way to make is feel so welcome and helped us get our bearings. Thank you! Would absolutely recommend Scooters place to anyone! 
1974131,20408881,2014-09-29,5619390,Maureen,"This is a fabulous place to stay while visiting Seattle. Scooter is truly a ""Super Host""! He met us with fresh flowers for the table and took time to personally show us around the neighborhood and recommend restaurants, parks and attractions for us. The suite is very clean, comfortable and quiet. Capitol Hill is a fun area to explore and we found it very easy to get to downtown Seattle by bus and on foot from there. Awesome rental"
1974131,20585622,2014-10-01,196524,Will,"Scooter is an amazing host and is a great communicator. His home is immaculate and incredibly charming in design. The house is in a beautiful neighborhood with sips and restaurants a few blocks away and downtown a quick Uber or bus ride. Scooter takes great pride in his work on AirBnB and goes the extra mile to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. He even went so far as to walk me to the high street and point out the best restaurants and coffee shops. I can't say enough good things about my experience there, can't wait to visit again. "
1974131,20743462,2014-10-05,19240171,Luisa,"This place is amazing and location was great! We absolutely loved the apt and loved Scooter. Scooter is such a great host- he knew it was our first time in Seattle so he went out of his way to show us around the area and gave us excellent tips.  The suite is so cute and cozy. The decor of the apt is superb! It is near cute cafes, restaurants and bars- public transportation is super close. We didn't use our car the whole time we were there. We will definitely be coming back! THANK YOU SCOOTER!!! 3"
1974131,20909953,2014-10-07,20179568,Tina,"This was my 1st AirBnb experience and Scooter definitely set the bar high. He was a great host and had everything ready when my fiancé and I arrived.  Scooter was helpful throughout the booking process and even when we met.  Also he has a very friendly and cute dog named Bart. 

The location was great.  A 2min walk to nearby restaurants and 10min drive to downtown.   Parking was  easy to find, especially with the parking passed provided by Scooter.  The studio itself was clean and spacious. We definitely recommend this place and would come back if we are ever in the area.

1974131,21445806,2014-10-17,11725549,Lindy,"OH MY GOSH.  We love Scooter (and Bart and Tim).  Scooter was very attentive to our needs before and during our stay.  He gave clear and concise directions and met us upon arrival.  His space was pristine.  It was so nice to travel and come back to a space at night that felt like a home and not a hotel.  It was super spacious and comfortable and the art he uses to decorate is on point.  Scooter and Bart (the adorable pup) gave us a tour of their town and it made my sister and I feel welcomed (email hidden)pecially the nice lady who gave us a flower.  Scooter checked in on us via text and we spent some time getting to know him and his partner over the course of our stay which is part of the fun of airbnb.  I wish every airbnb could have this type of hospitality and charm, but I guess that is what makes this space so incredible.  My sister and I hope to make a trip back to Seattle someday to stay here again and visit with such a charming couple (they were kind of the reason we loved city).  Stay in this space, you will not regret it... and the cowboy mural is pretty darn awesome. "
1974131,22095706,2014-10-30,4046346,Ailish,"Scooter and Bart met us and gave us a tour of Capitol Hill and from the beginning we knew we had found a special Airbnb experience! The suite is fantastic, has everything you could want and then some - the glitter ball and the cowboy being highlights"
1974131,22301217,2014-11-03,13585701,Greg,"Scooter and Tim were great hosts.  I arrived later in the evening and Scooter was still up to greet me and show me around the place.  The studio is fantastic, clean and convenient to all the great things on Capitol Hill.  If you have an appreciation for quirky things and art you will love it even more!  I have traveled to Seattle many times before but Scooter still had some great suggestions on local eateries - much appreciated!  "
1974131,22452881,2014-11-07,1913566,Iestyn,"We had a great time staying with Scooter in Capitol Hill. The neighbourhood is interesting and the apartment is close to all the action yet also quiet. we found the place super clean, really cosy, and well equipped with all the kitchen and bathroom stuff you might need. washing machine and drier was also great for people travelling. scooter gave us a tour of the area when we arrived and introduced us to Bart (his georgeous westie dog). Overall, great host and great place...recommended!"
1974131,22521727,2014-11-09,2343484,Kim,"Scooter is an awesome host - he is friendly, helpful, and looks after his home and neighbourhood. We also appreciated the artworks, and kitchen items like tea, sugar, and cups. Thanks for a great place to stay, Scooter!"
1974131,22706274,2014-11-12,1615589,Millicent,"Scooter, Tim & Bart :) - 

THANK YOU SO MUCH for making our stay in Seattle so absolutely wonderful!  I've stayed in several Airbnb places, and this was BY FAR the BEST experience I've had!  I wish we had a few more days to really explore Seattle to its fullest, but the time spent here has been so great.  Your neighborhood is fantastic and you are excellent hosts!  I couldn't have picked a better place to stay in Seattle!

Truly a wonderful little place in the heart of a vibrant neighborhood.  Easy access to transportation all over the city and to destination spots.  The hosts were warm, friendly, and spent lots of time showing us around the neighborhood.  We were provided with many recommendations, a map, as well as use of the tv, kitchen, free coffee/tea, and shampoo and other bath soaps.  Scooter was always available via text or phone call, and checked in on us periodically to make sure we were having fun! Best experience!"
1974131,22884622,2014-11-17,20626158,Michelle,"OMG, the only way to experience Seattle is to stay at Scooter's.  He is located in a safe/hip neighborhood, walking distance to so many bus lines.  There is no need to rent a car, unless you plan on going super far.  Now the suite, it's fantastic!  So spacious.  A full size bed, 1 blow up bed and a therm-a-rest, 2 couches, a functional kitchen, full size bathroom w/a washer & dryer.  All the amenities of home.  

Scooter is the host with the mostest.  Never met anyone who took this so seriously.   He has mapped out how to make your stay even more comfortable with a map of Seattle.  Recommends places to eat.  Which I did try some and they were yummy."
1974131,23146321,2014-11-24,7652711,Mark,"My boyfriend, Jake and I visit Seattle on the heels of my 40th birthday.  We had always wanted to visit, as we have considered relocating to Seattle from Milwaukee.  This was our second Air BnB experience, and I'm so happy to say that Scooter may have just spoiled every experience to come... in an EXCELLENT way, because his place and hospitality were beyond incredible.  Leading up to our visit, he both phoned and texted us to make sure everything was understood and covered for our stay.  Sadly, we were not able to meet him and his husband, Tim, as they were vacationing at the exact same time we were staying there, but he made sure we were in good hands with his friend, Jeff (and we were)!

The studio space was so clean, fun, and inviting.  Loved the keyless entry - we didn't have to tote keys around with us.  Scooter had even left a welcome message to my boyfriend and I on the fridge!  Everything we needed was available to us.  The location was perfect - nice and quiet neighborhood, and it felt safe - not to mention, it is so close to local bus stops to get downtown.  Buy an Orca card, load it up, and you're set to go for traveling around Seattle.  No need to rent a car.  

While we spent a lot of time in Seattle going out to eat - many of the places we went to were Scooter's perfect recommendations - we easily could have saved a few dollars by grocery shopping for a few meals at the (very) local Safeway and eaten in at the studio, as the kitchen was fully stocked.  The bathroom was cozy and fun (loved the shower curtain), and the bed was comfy.  The artwork was such a blast - we enjoyed the large mural of the hot cowboy watching over us, though the mannequin in the corner only creeped me out a touch (haha!).  We actually stayed in a couple nights to unwind, and the studio was a perfect place to do so.  

Jeff was most attentive and considerate.  We heard the cute patter of feet above us occasionally (Bart, Scooter and Tim's dog) and didn't find this annoying at all - it was charming and fun.  Jeff also let us know whenever he needed to do a load of laundry upstairs, or anything that might be noisy, which was most considerate of him.

Honestly, I cannot say enough about this space and how perfect it was for our first venture to Seattle.  We're definitely hoping we can snag Scooter and Tim's space again when we visit again.  It lived up to all the hype reviews on here.  Though we didn't meet them, we feel that we made wonderful friends with Scooter and Tim.  And it was such a pleasure to meet with Jeff and James  (Bart, too)! We would highly recommend the Dreampop Studio to future Seattle travelers.  STAY HERE!!!"
1974131,23244998,2014-11-26,2021778,Pei,"We absolutely loved staying in this space! It was clean, extremely well decorated, and just really fun to be in. The entry keypad is super convenient and the place is full of character. Scooter was helpful, responsive, and did everything he could to make our stay great. We would've loved having even more time to chat with him during our stay. This apartment is in a fantastic location. Parking isn't the easiest, but there's a parking pass available and a nearby lot which help. We would definitely stay again and remember our stay here as our favorite of our recent road trip."
1974131,23360276,2014-11-30,2740940,Trisha,"Scooter was the best and made for a great travel experience.  He was super accommodating, easy to talk to, kind and had great suggestions for eating/drinking locally.  The studio is clean, comfortable and in a great neighborhood.  We definitely plan on coming back this summer and will surely stay here again!"
1974131,23585163,2014-12-05,2851288,Sally,"Scooter's studio apartment was a perfect place to rest after a long drive. He communicated everything needed to find his home and to meet him.  My daughter and I were able to spread out in the spactious, warm and cozy abode. It had everything one could ask for, including coffee, teas, half and half in the frig and a full kitchen.  We could not have asked for a nicer spot to rest and reorganize. We took Scooter up on recommendations for dining...great food and shops within minutes of his home.
Thank you Scooter for your wonderful home away from home!!!"
1974131,23685707,2014-12-08,3881279,Michael,"Great place, great location and Scooter was a wonderful host! Not only did he welcome me into the space, he was more then eager to help guide and advise my time in Seattle. I would definitely stay there again and would happily recommend others to stay there as well. A truly wonderful place and experience!"
1974131,23827194,2014-12-11,13607811,Susan,"Scooter was extremely warm and engaging, giving us a great deal of enthusiastic information about the neighborhood, from restaurants and bakeries to architecture.  The area is very nice, conveniently located so that everything you need is in walking distance.  It was quiet at night, off the main roads in a lovely residential area.  Scooter's description of his rental flat is understated; it's really wonderful.  Playful decor, well-equipped, no expense spared on the plumbing fixtures, cupboards, furnishings.  There is even a mirror ball, in case you need to break out dancing.  Public transportation is readily available, but Scooter provides a guest parking pass for the street parking, and there was always a spot close by."
1974131,23992816,2014-12-16,22590535,Susan,"We arrived close to midnight at our AirB&B and our host was waiting for us, guiding us to our space and providing a genuine welcome.  The space was amazing...as a basement apartment, it was open, full of light and airy.  The setup was very inviting and was large enough for my adult children to join me and spend time together.
The neighborhood is lovely.  Even though our host warned us about loud street construction just outside the property, we were never disturbed.  Our host provided lots of information about where to go and how to get there.  We had total access to the space and freedom to come and go as we pleased.  He even provided a parking pass for our rental car.  I am hoping to stay here again when I return to Seattle for my daughter's wedding.  I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle, especially if you want to be in a local neighborhood and still near the beauty and liveliness of downtown Seattle.  This was my first experience with AirB&B and it was a winner."
1974131,24118237,2014-12-20,25192,Nancy,"Scooter is a wonderful host. He contacted us a few days before we arrived to see if we had any questions. Upon our arrival he oriented us to his studio apt. And the house manual. He checked in by text midway during our stay , too, to see if we needed anything. He was very warm, friendly , welcoming and accommodating !"
1974131,24210557,2014-12-22,1340323,Justin,"We had a great stay at the Dreampop Studio! Scooter's a great guy and was very communicative and went the extra mile to make sure we could find parking and that we had everything we needed.

The studio itself is fantastic! Very comfy and spacious, artsy, warm, inviting and completely unique. We were able to completely relax, had the amenities we needed and it was a great location as a home base for our trip to Seattle.

There are a lot of ""little things"" that Scooter adds to the experience that shows he knows how to be a stellar AirBnB host!

We would definitely stay again!"
1974131,24463301,2014-12-29,12227747,Caitlyn,"We had a great stay at the Dreampop Studio, a perfect home in a perfect neighbourhood. The studio is huge, cosy and 5 minutes walk from everything you need in Capitol Hill and so close to downtown. Scooter is the perfect host and made us feel so welcome. Will be recommending to our local friends! "
1974131,24634249,2015-01-01,1197414,David,"Located in one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in Seattle, the DreamPop studio was the perfect space to explore the city while providing a comfortable home base. Scooter goes above and beyond to provide a warm welcome to his guests, and the well-stocked studio contained anything needed while away from home. The studio is quiet and well appointed and extremely close to public transit. It truly is a great escape after a busy day in the city. Scooter is a great host and embodies what AirBNB is all about."
1974131,24906881,2015-01-03,11636868,Debbi & Andy," This was such a great experience. Such a comfortable, clean, large yet very cozy space. Very private. Great neighborhood. 
Scooter was such a good host, I wish we could stay longer. Maybe next time"
1974131,25097640,2015-01-06,24344924,Rachel,"Scooter was an amazing host! The space is absolutely wonderful; spacious, cozy, very clean, perfect location, all the little necessities you need, great kitchen, and perfectly private. Scooter (and Bart the dog) were friendly and very accommodating. Scooter gave use great advice on places to visit, where to eat, and even helped us figure out the local bike rental system! His hospitality was far above what we expected from AirBNB ( this was our first time using AirBNB). My boyfriend and I stayed for only a few days, but our experience was superb and we definetly be using Scooter's place again next time we explore the city!"
1974131,25309620,2015-01-12,1475741,Sam,"Scooter is an excellent host! My first solo experience with airbnb and he made it everything that I could expect and more. Scooter greeted me when I arrived (as did Bart) and was always available via email or text. The place was exactly as listed and there were no surprises. This was my first time in Seattle and Washington as a whole, and this place was welcoming and the perfect place to come back to after a day out and about. I will definitely be coming back here if I have any short trips to Seattle planned. Thanks Scooter!"
1974131,25448317,2015-01-16,9957470,Moritz,"The apartment was nice, fun and clean, the location was excellent, and Scooter was a great host who showed us around the neighbourhood and gave us great recommendations!

Would recommend this place any time! "
1974131,25538268,2015-01-19,7532645,Faye,"I cannot say enough about the amazing experience my boyfriend and I had at Scooter's Dreampop Studio.  The studio itself is furnished with everything one may need and if it isn't I'm sure the wonderfully helpful Scooter will try to get it. It is the perfect place to escape the rain and cozy up. The location is ideal.  It is so close to all the best that the city has to offer (we walked to most areas or took the bus, at the corner of the block).  There was nothing like coming home from restaurants and bars just a block away.  The host. Oh man, the host!  In the short time we stayed in the studio, Scooter made us feel like friends.  He has the most magnetic personality and is definitely a Seattle staple himself.  We would come back in a heartbeat, I hear the cherry blossoms in the spring are to die for...

"
1974131,25800188,2015-01-26,24920270,Paige,"Where do we begin?! Scooter made us feel like we were visiting an old friend.  He accommodated the check in/out times we needed!  He greeted us at the door, and showed us around the place and then took us to 15th ave and showed us around the area (highly recommend the tour).  He was so hospitable with everything we needed, is willing to give ideas of things to do, and even provides a map with bus routes on local things to do.

Anywho, enough about the phenomenal host...Lets talk about the location, cleanliness, and quirkiness of the studio.  You walk up the cobble stone path and head to the left side of the home.  Keyless (code) entry and walk down a few stairs.  There lies your really good sized home for your vacation to Seattle.  

Location: 5 minute walk from 15th ave with a smorgasbord of locally owned restaurants and bars.  It is a 5 minute walk from all the bus stops that will take you to all of Seattle's major landmarks.  If you are feeling up for it, it is a 20 minute walk to Pikes Place/ the downtown area.  This location can not be beat.

Cleanliness:  Freshly washed sheets, swiffered hardwood floors, sparkling sink and tub.  Even has a washer and dryer to do your laundry before heading home.

Quirkiness: Wall paintings, disco ball, photo backdrops give it a cute little quirky feel.  

If you want great location and a great host I highly recommend staying here.

Thank you Scooter!

1974131,25963065,2015-01-31,12745402,Zack,"Best Airbnb experience ever. Scooter got in touch with us in advance of our trip to see how he could improve our Seattle visit. When we arrived, he took the time to show us around the neighborhood and give us advice on places to check out. The studio was immaculate, well kept and super swank. The neighborhood is charming and the street very quiet despite being a short walk to bars and shops."
1974131,26159889,2015-02-05,1247895,James,"Scooter's place is everything Airbnb should be: a beautiful and clean space, exactly as described (maybe even a bit better) in a fantastic and convenient location. And what is left off the description is the gracious host who has the right combination of help and ease. A truly great experience. "
1974131,26252865,2015-02-08,20446799,Julie,Scooter is the best.  He is warm and welcoming with lots of great ideas for where to go and what to do in the area of his home and also downtown and other areas in Seattle.  It was a very comfortable space and I felt right at home.
1974131,26455931,2015-02-13,18608831,Joel,"We had a fabulous stay at the Dreampop Studio.  It was truly a dreamy stay! Capital Hill is a lively neighborhood with restaurants and coffee shops just a couple blocks away.  The studio itself is visually stimulating as well as comfortable, quiet and well cared for.  Scooter is an extremely gracious host that is attentive and helpful.  He will bend over backwards to help you find the experience you are searching for while staying in the Seattle area.   Hurry and book now! It is a popular place and having stayed there, we now know why! We would love to come back for a visit.  Thank-you Scooter!"
1974131,26586468,2015-02-16,23192371,Zixuan,CANNOT BE BETTER is the only word I can say about our experience with Scooter. Scooter is the best host I have ever seen! We had an ENTIRE floor as our private space. Scooter is very very nice and supportive. I am sure I will be back here again with Scooter next time. 
1974131,26858947,2015-02-21,7088042,Johnny,"If you are heading to Seattle for the first time, or anytime, Scooter's Dreampop Studio is the place to stay. First off, the place is huge and incredibly welcoming. Literally everything you need in a home away from home is here, but this place comes with the friendliest host who will help you make the most of your Seattle visit. Even if you have a little jet lag, you must join Scooter as he shows you his part of the Capital Hill neighborhood. Arguably the best neighborhood in Seattle according to the locals we chatted with, Scooter's 15th street is filled with great restaurants, a delicious bakery, and a whiskey bar to finish off your night. Scooter will set you in the right direction to see the sites and neighborhoods of Seattle. The Dreampop Studio is a block or less from three different bus stops heading all over the city. If you're like us and enjoy walking, you can easily stroll downhill to Pike Place Market or explore Volunteer and Interlaken parks on your way to the University of Washington campus. You must visit Ballard Street during your stay, and if the weather is nice, take the ferry to Bainbridge Island for some wine tasting.
In the end we couldn't have asked for a better location with an incredible host! Thanks again. -Johnny and Adam "
1974131,26985308,2015-02-23,951997,Laura,"This is the most wunderbar Airbnb ever. The suite is a great mix of cozy and funky, it's well equipped, and the sofas are sooooo comfy. The neighborhood is great -- steps away from tons of great restaurants , coffee shops and grocery stores, and right near the transit line. And Scooter totally rocks as a host. He truly cares about making his guests stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. I've already rebooked for another stay. Thank you for creating such a great space, Scooter! "
1974131,27128635,2015-02-26,26098895,Alex,"Scooter is a super nice host. He is thoughtful and warmly caring, not only in welcoming our arrivals but also very helpful in helping us to get to know Seattle. My wife Melody call the place Home Sweet Home because the decoration is warm and the place is spacious and clean. Everything we need is there and Scooter is available anytime if we have any questions. The location is quiet but super convenience to get to down town and other locations. Two Thumbs Up for our super host and the place. Oh, we will not forget the cute lovely Bart! Don't wanna say goodbye and surely highly recommend Scooter's place if you want to have a nice and pleasant stay in Seattle."
1974131,27260195,2015-03-01,26216295,Liz,"Scooter is great. Such a warm and friendly host. The studio exceeded  all expectations. It had a fun, comfortable vibe and was clean and had all the amenities we wanted. Scooter took us on a 10 minute tour of the area. So many great restaurants and shops around the area. He's very accommodating. He gave us a map of the area and showed us all the public transit areas and major spots to visit. Such a great host. Definitely recommend the Dreampop Studio!"
1974131,27398757,2015-03-03,10946027,Barbara,"Scooter was an excellent host, starting with making sure we knew how to get to his lovely home, and how and where to park. He greeted us personally and familiarized us with the lovely downstairs room, and the neighborhood. We felt right at home. The space was just like a small apartment with all of the conveniences of a complete home. Scooter goes above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of. The kitchen and bathroom are fully stocked with goodies from chic Seattle coffee and chocolate wafers to fancy shampoos and safety razors. The decor was awesome! There were lovely quilts, vintage posters, and a colorful mural on the wall. We enjoyed the showtime movies on the big screen TV and the cozy comfortable bed. The neighborhood is charming too. There are several restaurants and coffeeshops nearby, and also supermarkets. Everything is walkable, or a bus ride away. If you find a date thats not taken, we highly recommend this charming location."
1974131,27510856,2015-03-06,28102371,Emily,"This place was fantastic!!! Located in a darling neighborhood in walking distance of tons of restaurants, shops and groceries. The apartment is clean, cozy and adorable. Best of all, Scooter is a wonderful host. This being my first trip to Seattle, he took the time to explain all there is to do, how to get there, etc. He even took me on a small walking tour around the neighborhood to point out restaurant recommendations, etc.  Great place to stay!!"
1974131,28079288,2015-03-17,24847848,Sara,"Scooter was a fabulous host! From our initial correspondence through email, to meeting in person on our arrival, to check out, he was so incredibly helpful, kind, and just plain FUN to talk to!! Our first day, he was able to show us around the neighborhood and get us accommodated, plus gave us plenty of recommendations. We had an itinerary of our own, but were happy to try some of his recommendations as well! They were all spot on. He also has an adorable dog, Bart, who will greet you at the window. 
The dreampop studio is a really cute and quaint place; homey to make you feel comfortable and especially welcoming after a long day exploring Seattle. It's separate from the rest of the house so you have your privacy. It is well stocked with everything you could possibly need. If it's not there, Scooter is very accessible and might have whatever it is, or he will certainly be able to tell you where you can get it. He is just a text away! 
The studio is in a perfect location!! Capitol Hill is great. The house is in a cute and quiet neighborhood, a block away from 15th ave, which has some restaurants, bars, etc. It is nice to not live directly in the heart of everything but live close enough that it is easily accessible, believe me. It is 2 min walk away from the bus stop which will take you to the Seattle center, or Pike Place in 15 min. You can also walk directly to those places, but it is a bit hilly and we wanted to save some time. We did get a chance to walk to Pike and Pine st. though, where there are a ton of bars, restaurants, etc.-- the more ""loud"" part of Capitol Hill I suppose, and it took maybe 15 minutes. It is also about 10 min walk away from Volunteer Park. 

Thanks again Scooter!! We loved staying at the dreampop studio! 

Sara and Frank 

P.S. HIT UP LIBERTY (bar) and BAKERY NOUVEAU (breakfast!)!! THEY'RE SO GOOD.

Scooter, the host, is one of the most charming individuals I have ever met and will make every guest extremely welcome as you can see by the numerous rave reviews of his fantastic studio apartment. 
The studio itself is spacious, has every amenity that one could desire and is set in the heart of one of Seattle's best areas for local eateries and bars. Scooter will offer to take you on a tour of the area to make you feel at home and is a great source of knowledge for the Seattle area. 
If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, I implore you to make this listing your first port of call, I can whole heartedly assure you that your time in Seattle will be made that much more enjoyable by using this one-of-a-kind AirBnb property and host. "

As we entered the welcoming space, Scooter filled us in on everything from the latest neighborhood news to the best restaurants.  We felt like we were at our home away from home.  The location is perfect, bed super comfy, and the studio is perfect for hanging out.  The kitchen is fully stocked, wifi is great, and cable tv to boot.  Bart the little white dog will make you smile and Scooter will go above and beyond to make your Seattle stay memorable.  "

He was extremely helpful with giving restaurant recommendations, and did everything to help us feel welcome here. This was our first time using AirBnb, and we could not be happier! Dreampop Studios is so cozy and comfortable, and we will definitely be recommending it to others traveling to Seattle. "
1974131,28795168,2015-03-30,27643299,Lauren,"Scooter was very welcoming and helpful with our trip! He called me the day before we arrived to let me know that the public transit option from the airport (which we had been planning on using) wasn't running properly. His neighborhood is super cute and it's very accessible to downtown and the rest of the city. The fun, funky, open-layout studio was perfect for our girls trip. "

1974131,29505206,2015-04-08,28886481,Lisette,"The space was exactly as advertised!   Clean, quiet and nicely laid out inside.  Scooter is a thoughtful host - the bathroom had personal care items (had we forgotten ours), the towels were new and fluffy, there were lamps on both sides of the bed, and the kitchen seemed to be well stocked (although we didn't do much more than boil water and eat ice cream!)   The place was very easy to get to via public transportation and the cab was around $12 to the city center.    This was our first trip to Seattle, and he and his place made it a very memorable stay."
1974131,29904598,2015-04-14,5268838,Kathleen,"Scooter's place is fabulous! The location cannot be beat. There are lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. It's convenient to transit. The unit itself is quirky and fun. Having a key code for entry was super convenient. Scooter has the place stocked with every guide book or map you could ever need. The kitchen has all the necessities to cook a meal or just make a cup of tea. If the weather doesn't cooperate there is plenty of space to stretch out on the couches, play some board games, or take a bubble bath in the claw footed tub. Scooter is a thoughtful and generous host and I really felt at home here."
1974131,30067128,2015-04-17,9118380,Candace,"I traveled to Seattle to escape for a brief, writerly weekend, and absolutely adored this place. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, within blocks of restaurants and shops (and delicious tea and coffee!), and a brief jaunt to bus lines, but also far enough from the buzz to enjoy the stillness of a cute residential neighborhood.

The apartment itself is fantastic—spacious, spotless, inviting, and cozy. There's a full kitchen for those who'd prefer to venture to the nearby grocery store and prepare some meals at home. The heated floor is an indulgence, and the artwork (including a full mural) really brightens the place up. I also appreciated having a separate entryway so I could come and go without having to bother my hosts. 

Scooter has done an amazing job with this space. He is also a superb host, who kept in contact with me prior to and throughout my visit to make sure I had everything I needed. His knowledge of and appreciation for the neighborhood is extensive, and his hospitable nature genuine. He clearly takes pride in this endeavor, and sincerely appreciates his guests. Not to mention that he's an interesting person with whom I shared some great conversation!

I would absolutely stay at this spot again, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a private, cozy spot to get some work done or just to be in the heart of an awesome Seattle neighborhood. "
1974131,30665543,2015-04-26,26374128,Tricia,"Scooter was a wonderful host! A delight to speak with, he gave us great recommendations for what to do and see while we were in Seattle, and where to eat nearby. The studio is in a great neighborhood, with a nearby market, and a terrific array of nearby eateries and markets within walking distance. The bus stop is at the corner, but we would up walking for much of our stay. As other reviewers have noted the studio is fully appointed (with extra toiletries even, in case you forgot yours) attractive, and very clean, and if you decide you want to stay in and cook you have everything you need. I only hope that my next airbnb stay is as great!"
1974131,31177039,2015-05-03,951997,Laura,"This was my second time staying at Dreampop and I loved it even more than the first time. Scooter is the best host ever, and the property itself is just so beautiful and perfect. The decor, the attention to detail, the well-stocked kitchen, the comfy couches, the fabulous neighborhood -- I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this Airbnb is tops!"
1974131,31628015,2015-05-08,4541305,Bronwyn,Scooter was very welcoming and his property accurately reflected the listing.
1974131,31760690,2015-05-10,24766380,Heathyr,"Scooter truly raises the bar as an AirBnB host! From the moment we arrived he went out of his way to make my daughter and I feel welcome by offering a tour of his adorable neighborhood. He introduced us to local shops owners, restaurants and even provided some great recommendations based on our plans while we were in Seattle. He's an incredibly thoughtful and generous host and you can tell he genuinely cares about his guests having a wonderful experience while staying there.

The Dreampop Studio is perfectly located in Capitol Hill, near several bus lines and one block away from tons of great restaurants, unique shops and even grocery stores (if you prefer to eat-in and use the studio kitchen). The studio itself was unique, fun, welcoming and CLEAN! My daughter didn't want to leave and was joking about renting it long term so we could just stay in Seattle forever. I wish that were possible! :) 

This was our first time using AirBnB, so I really didn't know what to expect before our arrival. But after getting to know our hosts, I'm so happy I chose this place (based on all of the previous positive reviews) and that I had the opportunity to get to know Scooter, Tim and their adorable little pup Bart! I can honestly say that thanks to this booking with Air BnB, we left Seattle with new friends.

Thank you again, Scooter! I really enjoyed our conversations and I can't wait until the next time we make it back up to Seattle and can stay there again. Please keep in touch and let me know if you two ever find yourselves in Portland. XOXO"
1974131,32158564,2015-05-15,11624158,Simon,"From our first contact Scooter was lovely. So helpful, funny and gracious - his guide to the area made us laugh and we had a chance to check out the many recommendations on our trip with him around the neighbourhood. The studio is lovely and has everything you need and more. The garden is beautiful with gorgeous flowers, thanks Tim and Bart  is a great character. Highly recommended and if we were closer we would be frequent visitors"
1974131,32556137,2015-05-19,16064442,Patrick,"Recently spent a weekend at Dreampop Studio and couldn't be more pleased with the experience.  Scooter made us feel like friends from the moment we arrived and was full of recommendations and tips on how best to enjoy Seattle.  The unit is spacious, private, quiet and decorated with imagination, whimsy and thoughtfulness in mind.  And the neighborhood is one of the best in Seattle.  Although the house is on a quiet, tree-lined street, you are steps away from all the neighborhood has to offer.  Could't be more convenient.  Thank you Scooter, Tim and Bart the WonderWestie for making us feel so 
welcome.  "
1974131,32704803,2015-05-20,1915682,Michael,"There is definitely something to be said for visiting a city where you've never been and staying in an airbnb in a private residence in a unique neighborhood vs staying in a name-brand hotel in the middle of the city. This was exactly our recent experience staying with Scooter this past week. From the moment I booked his place, his communication was timely and welcoming. Scooter and his amazing dog Bart were waiting for us when we arrived and took the time to show the apartment, answer any questions we had about the 'hood and Seattle and make sure we were settled in nicely. The apartment itself is the basement level with separate entrance of a gorgeous house on a quiet street in a very fun neighborhood. It takes up the whole floor, has multiple rooms albeit in one large open space. The bed was super comfortable; the living has multiple couches and was very relaxing. The kitchen was also large. We were in the area to climb, visit friends, and eat out as much as possible so we only were in the apartment at night for sleeping but it was a very welcome place to come home to at night. Scooter even let us extend our ""late check out"" and let us keep bags upstairs as we had a later flight. When we did get a chance to wonder down to the city center, we were even more glad that we stayed in this quiet neighborhood, Its also very central a lot of supermarkets, restaurants, and other areas of the city. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle and we hope to stay there again when we come back!"
1974131,32880500,2015-05-23,26866798,Anna,"Scooter and his studio were even better than we had expected!  Scooter went out of his way to make sure we felt welcome and comfortable.  He gave us some helpful tips about the neighborhood and all of the best places to visit, near his property and in the city!  He knows it all!! We can't thank him enough for being such a gracious host. 

The Dreampop Studio was very comfortable, clean and had everything we needed (and more).  Way better than a hotel!  And in the perfect location!  Close to everything in a gorgeous neighborhood.  We felt adventurous our first day there and walked to Volunteer Park, Pike Place Market, and as far as Pioneer Square.  Needless to say, we were pooped by the that time so we took a $10 Uber ride ""home"" (may have been less if I didn't give the driver the wrong address).  

The entire stay was perfect.  Thanks again, Scooter!!

Anna and Alex"
1974131,33512126,2015-05-29,7509478,Nancy,"Scooter is a great host who assures that you know what to expect, how to get to his place, and where to go around the neighborhood and beyond. The Dreampop Studio is perfect for 1-3 people (maybe a 4th small person) -- spacious, comfy bed, full kitchen, private bathroom, and convenient location. Scooter has thought of everything you could possibly need and put it in the studio. I used public transportation from the airport and around town and found it quite easy. There are 2 grocery stores within a couple of blocks from the place and good restaurants nearby.  Next time I'm in Seattle, I would be happy to stay in the Dreampop Studio again."
1974131,33649577,2015-05-31,27436561,Renee,"Scooter made us feel welcome from the first moment we walked through his beautiful front yard.  It was like getting together with an old friend you haven't seen for a while and trying to catch up on lost time. Scooter and Bart (very cool doggie) took the time to give us a tour of the neighborhood.  Scooter is a true ambassador of the area.  He knows all the restaurant and shop owners and made fabulous recommendations on places to eat and hang out.  We travel to Seattle 4 or 5 times a year and this was our first AirBnB experience.  It will be very hard to match the wonderful time we had hanging out in Scooter's ""hood"".  The space was super clean and comfortable with full amenities.  It was great to come back after our adventures each evening and relax.  It felt like home.  I will be recommending Dreampop studio to anyone that plans on staying in Seattle.  Way better experience than a hotel.  Dreampop Studio was a truly a dream."
1974131,34065461,2015-06-04,23315874,Elaine,"Scooter was an amazing host! He took the time to go over the area and gave recommendations of what to see and where to eat during our stay. He made himself available if we needed anything, and solicited feedback from the first day on. We loved the studio and felt it was spacious and had everything we needed. It's also in such a prime location-you can't lose :) "
1974131,34517872,2015-06-09,8392312,Gidget,"Scooter was so friendly. He went out of his way to make you feel welcome and comfortable, from the fresh lilies in the window to the refreshments he placed in the fridge for us. He also gave us recommendations on the best places to eat in the area from breakfast to lunch. We tried several and all were delicious! The studio was clean, spacious and we were extremely comfortable! Dreampop studio is in the perfect location in Capital Hill. We would definitely stay again in the future. "
1974131,34764737,2015-06-12,26650909,Caitlin,This was my first experience with AirBnB and the bar has been set very high! Scooter was warm and welcoming. He offered wonderful suggestions on what to do and where to eat. We hope to stay with Scooter on our next trip to Seattle! 
1974131,35058435,2015-06-15,69452,Paula,"Everything about this stay was wonderful starting with the initial contact, few days prior reach out to the continual communication while visiting the area with just lovely check-ins regarding our needs to fast responses when we had questions.

The studio is so much more than just a studio.  It is rather large and well appointed with all needed amenities; very tastefully decorated yet with a flare to artistic.

The area is one of the best areas in Seattle.  The place is located one street down on a tree lined street from a vibrant and eclectic neighborhood community that you can get everything from excellent coffee and pastries to delicious meals plus a great Safeway or QFC if you are wanting to cook in a night or two.

Scooter is in the right professional as an airbnb host;  Next on the list is nominating him for a key to the city since he is knowledge, positive, uplifting and fun....he does Seattle proud."
1974131,35299710,2015-06-17,31174472,Esther,"Scooter was there when we arrived, early, he allowed us entry to the apartment and gave us suggestions as where to grab a bite to eat while he finished preparing our home away from home. 
His apartment is lovingly anointed, warm, cozy and inviting. Alan had just arrived from Austalia and together we found Scooter and his home inviting and restorative. 
There was yogurt, milk, coffee, oats, etc. In the bathroom amongst all the lovely toiletries there was even a toothbrush should you find you've forgotten yours.
We loved the neighborhood!! Super location for playing tourist and resting up for our continued journey.
Thank you Scooter and Tim for making our stay feel more like visiting an old friends, we hadn't yet met."
1974131,35631989,2015-06-21,17297933,Jeff,"The Dreampop Studio was a dream. Scooter is a great host and he quickly made me feel right at home. 

The private studio is great with everything you would need for a short or long stay. I found the bed very comfortable and the living room area was very comfortable with a great TV. 

Scooter gave me a quick tour of the neighborhood and gave me restaurant reviews as we checked out the area. Liberty is a great local tavern with some tasty sushi. I also enjoyed a nice cup of coffee at Victrola. 

The studio is located in the beautiful Capital Hill area. Do yourself a favor and check out the beautiful homes as you stroll to Volunteer Park. 

There are bus stops within a couple of blocks of the house and I found getting around Seattle very simple. The bus drivers I encountered were kind and helpful. You can easily get to many of the Seattle highlights, the Space Needle and the Public Market. You should also check out the EMP Museum. I had a blast there. 

I had a great stay and I highly recommend the Dreampop Studio. 

"
1974131,35920457,2015-06-23,17079436,Chris,"We had a wonderful & unique stay at Scooter's fabulous studio. Scooter is probably the friendliest, most helpful, personable airbnb host we've ever
met, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way. 

Aside from the brilliantly decorated and spacious suite, you will find information on everything there is to do in the area. Put away your tripadvisor app and take advantage of all the great suggestions, literature that are in the suite. 

Perfect place in an amazing city. "
1974131,36259459,2015-06-27,3507683,Deborah,"Scooter was a fabulous, funny, friendly host.  He's what awesome looks like!  He met us as we arrived, helped us with parking, explained everything about his great studio.  It's pretty huge and very comfortable, and we were  grateful that it was in the basement, as Seattle was experiencing a heat wave while we were there. The kitchen had everything we needed.  But the best part was the location.   My partner and I are very familiar with Seattle, having lived there just blocks from Scooter's place.  We both feel that Capitol HIll is the best neighborhood in the city, based on great restaurants, walkability, easy bus connections and just plain good energy.  Scooter's place is in a prime location on the hill.  I can't imagine a better place to stay while in Seattle. Don't bother to look elsewhere but book early because I think the word is out!"
1974131,36755537,2015-07-01,25173388,Robin,"Scooter was amazing, and his place is amazing.   The best BnB we have stayed at hands down.  He also provided a nice welcome, which was totally unexpected and rare.  The location is ideal and the house is amazing.  So nice!!!!"
1974131,36950859,2015-07-03,15102641,Jenn,"Scooter is the epitome of the host with the most! As soon as we arrived, Scooter and his adorable dog Bart greeted us and showed us around the studio and  the neighborhood (which is lovely- tons of options for unique food, craft drinks, and fun shopping).  Scooter was great about giving suggestions on where to eat and how to get around, which was so helpful and made our trip less stressful. Scooter was also fantastic about communicating with me before and after our stay. 

The studio is exactly as shown in the pictures. To be honest, it was better than what I was expecting (Scooter even had fresh flowers for us that smelled amazing!!!). Everyday I would come home tired from adventuring in Seattle, but found myself excited to get into the Dream Pop Studio for the night (maybe because the bed was very, very comfortable). I really didn’t want to leave by the end of our stay! Scooter also has everything you would possibly need and more in the studio- custom maps, info for a plethora of local attractions (and he can probably tell you how to get there, too), toiletries, a working disco ball…great wifi! 

The studio is in a great, central area. We felt very safe the entire time we stayed at the studio. We had easy access to transportation (bus) and found that Lyft to the studio from downtown was pretty cheap. Many places we accessed by walking, too! 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat! And would recommend to all my friends and family! We love this place! 
"
1974131,37284405,2015-07-06,20467754,Chris,"Scooter is the man.  He is more than willing to point out the neighborhood hot spots, must-eats, and must-dos.  He is detail-oriented and goes out of his way to ensure the place is clean and welcoming.  Forgot a toiletry item?  No problem.  Scooter has stocked the house from kitchen to bathroom with the essentials.  The neighborhood is amazing, and the residence was even more amazing.  Thanks, Scooter!"
1974131,37643919,2015-07-09,5970423,Steven,"Without question this is one of the best airbnb suites available in Seattle. Scooter is a fantastic host and the space is perfect. Also, Capitol Hill is great neighborhood with lots of cool spots to eat and drink nearby. I highly recommend."
1974131,38590045,2015-07-17,27279965,John,"This place was brilliant, it was better than described with a huge amount of space and nice and quiet. The area around is also good and there is a regular local bus service into the downtown area.

Scooter is great, he offers suggestions to eat in the local area and the guide in the studio is also comprehensive. I would definitely book this studio again when I come back to Seattle. "
1974131,38991431,2015-07-20,22458061,Laura,"Our host, Scooter Lowrimore, was the most gracious host we ever had. He helped us bring our luggage in to start with. He showed us around the neighborhood visiting different restaurants. He showed us where the bus stops were to go downtown. He had a map set up with the different buses we could take and where they went. There was loads of info in the rental. The airbnb was much larger than we expected. We had our own washer/dryer which was a plus. I can't find anything negative to say about either the host, rental or neighborhood. We loved it all."
1974131,40071268,2015-07-28,563637,Nova,Scooter's place was fantastic.  Very spacious and had all of the amenities and then some.  He is a wonderful host who loves his home and neighborhood.   The house is within walking distance to two different grocery stores and wonderful shops and restaurants.  We parked our motorcycles for the week and travelled by city transit.  It was a great home away from home experience. 
1974131,40420734,2015-07-31,13445838,Andrew,"Scooter really was the ultimate host making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived until we left.  The studio was a fantastic space and cool in every sense of the word which was welcome in temperatures of 90+ degrees.  Scooter had thoughtfully left cold drinks in the fridge for us as well as everything else that we needed for our stay.  The studio was perfect for fourfold us with our kids very comfortable on the inflatable air beds.    Scooter helped with planning our itinerary for our short stay in Seattle and gave great local restaurant recommendations as well as advising us onhow to travel around the city using Scooter's rapid transit card,  just reimbursing him for the cost of the fares when we left.  We only wished ee had booked a longer stay."
1974131,41065957,2015-08-04,29587216,Theresia,"Already booking the place we knew we couldn't have gone wrong with choosing the Dreampop studio. Scooter was super fast in replying to all our questions we had before our trip even started... Then, the day we arrived on Capitol Hill couldn't have started any better - Scooter was welcoming, uncomplicated, easy to chat to and even gave us a tour around his neighborhood what we very much appreciated and gave us a first great impression! The studio itself was clean and cozy. There is really everything you need for some nice days in Seattle! "
1974131,41335477,2015-08-07,24051940,Leah,"The apartment was spacious and spotless and the neighborhood is fantastic - great eating places, a wonderful park and convenient to other parts of the city.  Our host was warm and welcoming and helpful. "
1974131,41728870,2015-08-09,109207,Arlene,"From the warm welcome we received from Scooter when we first arrived at his unique studio, to his personal tour of Capital Hill, we could not have asked for a better experience. He was born to be a host ... so full of personality, kindness and a genuine interest in those who stay with him. We highly recommend staying here if you're planning a trip to the beautiful city of Seattle. We loved every minute of it! Thanks, Scooter:)"
1974131,42129655,2015-08-11,30000576,Kelly,"Scooter gave us a warm welcome and showed us around the studio upon arrival.  The studio was spacious and clean.  The bed and couches were comfortable and great to sleep on.  Plenty of bedding and towels were provided.  Also loved that there was a wide selection of toiletries and laundry detergent was provided.  Wi-fi worked well.  There is a parking lot to park a car in if you have one, but no car is really needed as the bus stop for the bus that takes you to the pike place market is at the end of the block.  A supermarket and several restaurants are just a block away.  Scooters gave us a few recommendations of his favorite spots and provided travel brochures and local restaurant menus as well.  We didn't use the kitchen for cooking, but it seemed to be well stocked.  Would stay here again if I'm back in Seattle."
1974131,42394933,2015-08-13,24210465,Kyle,"We had a great stay at Scooter's studio. Scooter was very nice and accommodating with many great suggestions for food, entertainment, and how to get around. The location was perfect, with many nearby options for food and such. Getting downtown was a short cab or drive away or a very manageable walk! The studio was very clean and spacious. Would highly recommend!"
1974131,43600219,2015-08-21,11011609,Karen,"Scooter is a fantastic host.  He was extremely welcoming and even took the time to take us on a tour of the neighborhood.  The location is excellent, easy access to public transport and great restaurants in Capitol Hill.  The studio is immaculately clean and just as described in the listing.  We particularly enjoyed hanging out on Scooter & Tim's porch playing some of the board games thoughtfully provided.  I highly recommend a stay here.  "
1974131,44113266,2015-08-24,355066,Chryss,"Scooter's place in Seattle was seriously awesome. The only place to stay. Instead of waxing lyrical about how much we loved it, I'll just point out the best features: 

1. Spacious, super clean and filled with personality. 
2. Comfy bed. 
3. Cool basement apartment means air-con not necessary even when it's hot outside. Just open the windows for some cross-flow. 
4. Hot shower with plenty of water pressure. Awesome to relax our tired muscles after hours of walking this great city all day. 
5. Location, location, location. We walked everywhere. Shops, restaurants and bars all at your feet. 
6. The hosts were sooooooo lovely. Super friendly, but also very respectful of our privacy. 

I have no hesitation in recommending Dreampop Studio to anyone visiting Seatle. "
1974131,45062685,2015-08-31,32004890,Scott,"If you're tired of the overpriced ho hum hotel room then this is the place for you! I felt right at home the second I got there (it's actually WAY more interesting than my home but you know what I mean). It is obvious to me that Scooter takes great pains to ensure every guest's stay is excellent. He is a great ambassador for Seattle and is a wealth of information for things to see/do. The location is perfect; it's close to everything but is situated on a nice quiet street.

My girlfriend didn't want me to write a good review so it would be ""our little secret"" but I can't do that in good conscience. Ha!"
1974131,45363398,2015-09-02,13284213,Maureen,Scooter is a fabulous host.  Goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable. Great neighborhood. Lovely old house.  Plenty of good restaurants and supermarket nearby.  Transport easy by bus for most attractions. Hired a car for others.  Ran out of time.  Will  come back again. Loved it.
1974131,45770557,2015-09-06,32221700,Anthony,Listing was described accurately. Host was great. 
1974131,46162646,2015-09-08,40398811,Trace,"Scooter was more than an amazing host, he let us know about every element of the space and went out of his way to make my girlfriend and me feel welcomed. He showed us around the neighborhood and gave us some great tips on restaurants. 
The place itself is incredible, such a spacious studio and was very homey. We loved every aspect of the experience from the studio to the ability to walk most places with quick accessibility to public transit as well. I'd recommend this listing to anyone, you will be pleasantly accommodated and have the time of your life here. Beyond everything, we felt truly immersed into the surrounding environment and fell in love with the city."
1974131,46470125,2015-09-11,21380929,Ron,"This is the model for airbnb. Scooter is the perfect host - there when you need him; disappearing when you don't.
 The apartment is an excellent size - larger than it looks in the pictures - with ample closet and drawer spaces, a well-equipped kitchen and dining area, and well-chosen furniture. It's located in a delightful residential neighborhood and is right around the corner from great small, non-chain restaurants and stores.
 If Scooter is available, by all means take him up on his offer of a short tour of the neighborhood - he introduces you to the owners of his favorite stores and restaurants and you feel like a regular when you go back - in our case, later that afternoon.
 We'll definitely try to book here for our next trip to Seattle.
"
1974131,47142457,2015-09-16,2278038,Laura,"Scooters place is just perfect, lovely, very well equipped, perfectly clean and in a great neighborhood. A great start to our vacation and the best possible way to explore Seattle. If we ever make it back from Germany to Seattle my husband and I would stay again with Scooter. Thanks Scooter for sharing your home with us. Best Laura & Carsten"
1974131,47375325,2015-09-18,3425835,Andrew,"Loved this place. As Seattle was a bit rainy, this apartment was warm, dry, and cozy. It was also completely stress-free, perfect for our two-night stay on Capitol Hill. There is no key, but a convenient electronic lock. The location is perfect, just a block from one of the best little neighborhoods in all of Seattle. And Scooter was such a great and welcoming host! We would happily return when we visit again. Thanks!"
1974131,47631790,2015-09-21,3790062,Steve,"Scooter was an excellent host, showed us around the neighborhood (which is awesome), gave us great dining/drinking recommendations, etc. The accommodations were top notch, as well. Look forward to staying with Scooter again on our next visit."
1974131,48515871,2015-09-27,15858753,Grace,"Scooter was an excellent host!!  He is an extremely warm, welcoming, and caring.  He was very communicative throughout the entire process, from answering my questions prior to my visit, to messaging me on the day of my arrival.  From the moment my husband and I arrived at Scooter's apartment, Scooter was extremely friendly and offered many helpful suggestions for places to eat, drink coffee, and visit!  By the end of our visit, we felt like we had known each other for a while and consider Scooter a friend. :)

Scooter's apartment is exactly as the pictures illustrate -- beautiful, comfortable, and well-stocked with kitchen and bathroom supplies!  We loved coming home to this apartment after each of our full days  spent exploring the beautiful neighborhoods in the city!  We had many wonderful adventures in this city and the location of this apartment was key to many of our great experiences.  Scooter's apartment is quite literally in the heart of our favorite neighborhood in Seattle -- Capitol Hill.  Each morning, we loved walking to a coffee shop for amazing coffee and a light breakfast before starting our day.  Within 8 blocks of Scooter's apartment, we tried 7 
different coffee shops, all of which were a little piece of coffee heaven! :)

My hubby and I are already looking forward to planning our next trip to this amazing city.  We hope to stay with Scooter in his lovely Dream Pop studio once again!! :)  Thank you, Scooter!!! :)"
1974131,48901976,2015-09-29,17098237,Natalie,"We loved Scooter, Bart and Dream Pop Studio! Located in a charming neighborhood in Capital Hill, this place was just adorable - you have to stay here! Scooter met us when we arrived, showed us around, gave us parking - even had a cute welcome sign customized for us. The entire place felt open and fun, and really cozy too. Perfect to come back to after a busy day exploring. Scooter clearly thought of every detail to make us comfortable - he was a rockstar host. The studio was stocked with anything you could need and he would check in to make sure we were doing ok, gave us excellent recommendations and was all around super warm and friendly. I can't say enough good things about our experience and we can't wait to come back!"
1974131,49214226,2015-10-02,8964541,Devin,"This was one of the best AirBnB experiences we've had, Scooter was a fantastic host (Bart too!). Scooter has a knack for detail, the studio is filled with everything you would need and he has even compiled a collection of restaurant menus and event pamphlets from the local area. 

If you get the opportunity, most definitely take him up on his offer for a tour of the local neighbourhood! He'll show you around and introduce you to some of his favourite restaurants and bars nearby. 

Dream Pop Studio is clean and cosy, you will most definitely feel at home here. The bed is comfy, there is a kitchen area and the shower has great water pressure. Wi-Fi worked great with no issues. It's located in the beautiful Capitol Hill area, the neighbourhood is friendly and safe, we walked everywhere from here and had no issues walking home at night from nearby bars and restaurants. Location A+

I've only got positive things to say about Scooter and Dream Pop Studio, so do yourself a favour and make this your go-to Seattle AirBnB.
"
1974131,49609008,2015-10-05,20079323,Lindley,"We've stayed in several AirBnB apartments, and this one is easily our favorite. The apartment is right off of 15th street with access to lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Scooter's house was easy to find, and the apartment was very clean, well-located, and spacious. Easily the friendliest host we've encountered, Scooter was very helpful and excited to host us, and even took us on a tour of the neighborhood and pointed out some of his favorite spots. 

Thank you Scooter, for being a fantastic host! Also - we got engaged in the apartment (sorry for the surprise - we had to tell our families first!) so it will always be special to us, and we will definitely be back when we find ourselves back in Seattle."
1974131,50099571,2015-10-09,24912778,Monique,"It was an absolute pleasure staying at this air bnb. Scooter greeted us as soon as we arrived and once we settled in he took us on a tour of the neighborhood and local businesses. He went out of his way to seek out some vegan friendly options nearby (there are many).

Scooter also had everything imaginable that someone could need while staying there from travel size toiletries to travel guides for the local attractions it felt almost like staying in a resort only way cooler :) This place is great and I highly recommend locking in a reservation at least a couple months in advance as it books up quickly!"
1974131,50610859,2015-10-13,2889987,David,"This place offers the Model Airbnb experience....it encompasses all the elements....a great apartment, a beautiful neigbourhood, the nicest host you could meet and a very personal and unique experience....it's no wonder Scooter has 167 5* reviews.

The apartment is spacious, comfortable, well equipped. The bed is very comfortable with nice linens and pillows. The kitchen has all that you need to cater for yourselves and there is a washing machine and dryer should you need it. A big TV with cable and movies. What makes it stand out however is that it is full of Scooter's personality.....it's fun and quirky and artistic and charming.

The apartment is located in a lovely leafy neighbourhood.  We were lucky to be there in the fall when the trees were changing colour and they were beautiful. There is a danger that you'll just head out downtown everyday, but don't miss walking around the streets of Capitol Hill. There are some beautiful houses and Volunteer Park is a lovely green oasis.

There are plenty of local shops and a large Safeway just around the corner which is very convenient and there are some very nice restaurants, so perfect for evenings out without having to drive the car.

We didn't use the bus, choosing instead to walk downtown every day so that we could fully experience the sights and people of the City. We felt safe walking everywhere.

Perhaps what makes Dreampop extra special, is your host Scooter. He is a genuinely lovely guy who wants his guests to really enjoy his City and his neighbourhood. He goes out of his way to make you welcome and you will feel like you are meeting up with an old friend. 

Probably the best Airbnb we have stayed in... This is the place that we'll look back on and remember with a very special fondness....thank you Scooter, Tim and the gorgeous Bart."
1974131,51698269,2015-10-24,17639973,Harold,"If out first experience with Airbnb is any indication of how the service works, we will be a life long user. Scooter was a great host and provided a warm, comfortable location in the hart of Seattle. Scooter's home was centrally located on a quiet residential street that is minutes away from great restaurants and bars. 

We arrived late but Scooter welcomed us in and got us situated. The parking pass that he let us use was very helpful for our rental vehicle. The next morning Scooter gave us a great tour of the neighborhood. When we come back to Seattle, we will be staying with Scooter."
1974131,51891050,2015-10-25,28881890,Denise,"Wonderful stay!  My husband and I were visiting our daughter at Seattle U., about a 20 minute walk.  Scooter was extremely helpful- provided us with  information for neighborhood restaurants and places to visit in Seattle.   Our room was a pleasure to be  in- spacious, light and clean. We felt at home and  we will return!"
1974131,52426202,2015-10-29,37733062,Crysta,Scooter was a fantastic host. He warmly welcomed us to his home and the neighborhood. Scooter gave us great information on local restaurants and events. His space had everything we needed and was in a great location in Seattle.  
1974131,53177995,2015-11-06,1760318,Alex,"We had a great time staying at the Dream Pop Studio, it is comfortable, warm and has all the essentials - a fully equipped kitchen, hot shower and of course a mirror ball!

Scooter is an impeccable host, friendly and helpful with tips on where to eat, and useful local knowledge (museums are free first Thursday of the month!) going above and beyond the call of duty to provide an excellent stay.

The area is great, full of little coffee shops and craft beer places; walkable to the centre of town and with excellent bus links, getting around was no problem.

Favourite places on our stay were (in Capitol Hill) Elysian, Sun Distillery, Linda’s Tavern and Sitka & Spruce. 

We also very much enjoyed visiting Fremont, Milstead coffee and Geocaching HQ.
"
1974131,53468424,2015-11-09,6041543,Sarah,We had a wonderful stay so comfortable and taken care of. Our exchange student daughter loved everything. The disco ball was her favorite.  Scooter was attentive and I had a comfortable friendly chat over coffee with him.  Scooter's place is still my favorite in Seattle. 
1974131,53756484,2015-11-12,3317040,Nate,"This was the perfect place for our stay! Close to lots of amazing restaurants and shops and you can easily walk to most of them. The street is idyllic and the space is cozy and inviting. Scooter was an amazing host, offering lots of recommendations and making us feel welcome! "
1974131,54094646,2015-11-16,5391860,Mara,"Scooter was as excellent a host as the reviews we read in advance promised!  He was attentive, welcoming, flexible and helpful.  And his place is adorable.  The space is open and decorated with all sorts of beautiful and lively objects, the kitchen has all that we needed, and we were able to have several family gatherings there with no hassle at all.  When we return to Seattle, as we will surely do now that my daughter has settled there, we will always see if Scooter's place is available first!"
1974131,54854302,2015-11-25,7652711,Mark,"My boyfriend Jake and I visited Seattle for my birthday again this year, staying for a second time in Scooter and Tim's Dreampop Studio. Scooter was there to greet us warmly when we arrived - it was so nice to meet him this time around! - and everything was just as warm and comfortable as we remembered it. This is truly THE place to stay while you are visiting Seattle. It has all the amenities you need, and honestly, I'm always so struck by how cozy and warm it is after touring the city, especially after a cooler, damper day. Scooter and Tim (and Bart!) are the most gracious of hosts and they're also very kind and respectful of your privacy. Jake and I both enjoyed kicking back and just relaxing at the end of every busy day in the studio - enjoying some wine and cheese and chocolate, watching a movie on TV, and yes, we're always tempted to turn on the disco ball for some fun ambience too!  

We will continue to come back to Seattle and stay in the Dreampop Studio. It's fun, comfortable, and hosted by probably the most fabulous couple in all of Seattle! Many thanks too to Scooter and Tim for joining us for birthday drinks and dinner - it was a special kick-off and highlight to a fantastic trip. And Tim, the ride in to the airport when we left was a tremendous help! The Dreampop Studio definitely feels like our second home and we miss it when we are away! THANK YOU!"
1974131,55563540,2015-12-02,45326894,Eric,"Scooter could not have been more accommodating from our first contact through departure.  The place is great, comfortable and convenient to all of Capital Hill and Downtown via bus.  I would definitely stay there again.  Also, note that it was well furnished with utensils, toiletries, etc....  Things you expect, but don't always get."
1974131,55735627,2015-12-05,9232003,Danielle,"Scooters place is incredibly comfortable and visually intriguing. He was a wonderful host, easy to communicate with and very accommodating. "
1974131,56241904,2015-12-11,6159690,Sam,"What can I say, this is gold standard Airbnb right here. Scooter is one of the best hosts you are going to find (sorry Scooter, I know I'm setting high expectations for future guests!) He is exceptionally kind, helpful, down to earth and great to chat with.

Scooter greeted us on check-in and not only did he show us around the (fantastic) studio, but imparted suggestions and advice about things to do and see in Seattle and how to get around. We came to Seattle with a very basic plan, so this information was invaluable.

The studio itself -- very unique, spacious and stylish. It's located in Capitol Hill which is a great neighbourhood. Plenty of great bars, restaurants and quirky stores within short walking distance, and downtown is either a 30 min walk or an easy bus ride (take advantage of the Orca Card loaned by Scooter!) The studio has its own secure keyless access from the side of the house, full kitchen, comfy bed, lounge area, laundry facilities, and is well-stocked with every convenience and appliance you can think of. We felt at home and in need of nothing. We also felt reassured that our host would be more than happy to field any questions or requests that we had.

If and when we return to Seattle, there's no doubt we'd stay with Scooter and Tim and their cute pup Bart in a heartbeat. In the unfortunate case that Dreampop Studio was not available, we'd lament, but would definitely stay somewhere in the Capitol Hill area."
1974131,56784802,2015-12-18,9124500,Merrill,"I have found my ideal home away from home at Dreampop! The location is perfect in the grooviest part of CH, safely situated on a great craftsman block and a walkable distance to downtown. The pics tell it like it is - a super clean, cozy and curated space with all the amenities you need.

Scooter is the perfect host. Communication and welcome is simple and very accommodating. He is super helpful and just the right amount of friendly. 

I look forward to returning in my next trip to Seattle."
1974131,57007013,2015-12-21,10489038,Annie,Scooter is a fabulously informed and energetic host.  I felt like we could ask him anything and he would happily go about finding the answer.   The studio is comfortable enough for a week's stay and the area is robust enough to keep you occupied for at least that long.  I LOVE the artistic touches throughout.  There is nothing subtle about this space.  Plenty of light and separate kitchen/living/sleeping space.  Don't miss out on this experience.
1974131,57747206,2015-12-29,15682303,Richard,"This listing is everything it's advertised and more. Your host, Scooter, is friendly, professional and very easy to work with. If you're staying on Capitol Hill, look no further, you've found your place. 

The neighborhood is beautiful - everything you need is within walking distance; groceries, trendy boutiques, lots of restaurants.

The host provides virtually all of the amenities. You can leave your hair-dryer, shampoo, soap, iron, etc at home. "
716829,4304953,2013-04-26,4693251,Brendan,"Very unique and funky space!  The hanging bed is comfortable and fun, you can rock yourself to sleep each night.  The garden and eclectic art around the shack is great. Nice privacy out back, great for relaxing.  The only downside is that there is no plumbing, but there is a garden hose hooked up to an outdoor sink, so if you're able to survive ""camp style"" - you'll be just fine!  There is also water cooler and full refrigerator / freezer, so it was not a problem for me.  Lisa is a very kind host and Steinway is the friendliest dog around!    "
7860710,45647188,2015-09-04,41063344,Lachlan,Sid's place was lovely to stay at. Perfectly clean and with everything you could require. Location is also brilliant. Recommended place to stay!
7860710,47128274,2015-09-15,43919004,Brianna,"My boyfriend and I took a quick weekend getaway to Seattle and this was our first airbnb experience. We absolutely loved Sid's place! Located right in the heart of downtown Seattle we were able to explore capital hill and downtown super easily! We ended up buying fresh fish from the market and cooking a fancy dinner for ourselves at the apartment(probably one of the best parts of our trip!) Sid was also communicative and we had zero problems checking in or with anything at all. Thank you for making our experience so perfect and memorable! We will definitely be back :) 
Brianna and Jackson "
7860710,47237156,2015-09-16,10277289,Mitch,"Sid made this experience as simple and easy as possible! Directions to the apartment were very clear. The apartment itself was very clean and nicely decorated.

On top of all that, the apartment was very convenient to the heart of Seattle. Great shopping area nearby, and Pike place was a short 10 minute walk away.

Sid was a great host - easy to get a hold of and very responsive."
7860710,49820207,2015-10-06,17751569,Mary,"This is one of the best Airbnb experiences yet! Sid was easy to communicate with and could not have been nicer. I'd reserved another Airbnb weeks earlier but they canceled my reservation a couple of weeks before I was due to arrive. That's when I found this listing, which was practically brand new. It's the perfect location for exploring Seattle! Just a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market or the Seattle Art Museum, the Westlake Transit station is a 5-minute walk (pleasant ride to the airport is only $3!), Capitol Hill is maybe 15-20 minutes by foot, and the monorail to Chihuly's Glass Garden is just a few blocks away. 
The apartment is perfect for one or two people and has lots of amenities. It was very clean when I arrived, and the building is quiet - I hardly heard or saw anyone during my week there. There's a nice kitchen, big fluffy towels in the bathroom, smooth sheets and a comfy bed, fans if you need them (I used them mostly as 'white noise' at night since I liked the window open and there was a little street noise), a washer and dryer, lots of info and maps of Seattle, and an eclectic bookshelf :)
Cafe Senso Unico is just down the street if you like great espresso, too many restaurants to list in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are a short walk away (but I was lucky enough to go to Sitka and Spruce for lunch and Taylor's Shellfish for oysters and crab - divine!). 
I didn't have a car, but parking is expensive in this area, just in case you're driving in. 
In short, I loved it!"
7860710,50053919,2015-10-08,18286995,Dennis,"I was impressed from the start.  Sid knew I wanted to check in early and drop off my luggage and he made that happen.  Great communication from the start.  When I walked in, I was immediately impressed with the cleanliness and the furniture.  The unit seems large.  The bedroom was large and comfortable.  The neighborhood was okay, but was kind of a long walk to reach the sights and the train.  The house had papers with helpful hints about the house and its usage.  Overall a great airbnb experience.  Next time I am in Seattle, I would contact Sid once again."
7860710,50164140,2015-10-10,36379733,Sophie,Great location. The apartment is really modern and clean. I recommend the Carlisle Room. We had a fabulous dinner there on our last night. It's next door. Thanks Sid
7860710,50953167,2015-10-16,26323434,Rob,Sid's apartment was perfect for me.  He was easy to communicate with and was very flexible with check-in time (which was so helpful after a very LONG day of travel).  The apartment is very comfortable and so close to everything you want to do in downtown Seattle.
7860710,51336422,2015-10-19,20441760,David James,Great location and easy access to nightlife and restaurants.
7860710,52199450,2015-10-26,9228404,Ruben,"Amazing luxury apartment, very close to everything."
7860710,53902621,2015-11-14,35305841,Martina,"Very clean condo with exceptional access to public transportation. If you rent a car (like I needed to), there is paid parking around the corner - no garage. Communication with Sid was good. Easy to get into unit. Overall my stay was pleasant. "
7860710,54273444,2015-11-17,4005994,April,"Very accurate description. I can't say enough about how great of a location it is! My bf and I felt very safe, and there were many stores and restaurants nearby. A quick 10 minute walk took us directly to Pike Place Market. When we didn't feel like walking, we Uber'ed and the trip was usually $5-$10, not bad at all. The actual digs are very neat, clean and modern, bed was comfy and cozy, and washroom tidy with plentiful fluffy towels. We never got to meet Sid, but the check-in process was a breeze and he was responsive and worked with us to stow our bags since our flight came in early. We definitely enjoyed our stay in Seattle and would definitely stay at Sid's listing again!"
1882316,10412807,2014-02-17,202299,Evelyn,"This was one of my best Airbnb experiences and I've stayed in a lot of places!  The place was spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. We didn't get to take advantage of the beautiful outdoor area because of the weather, but it would be great for outdoor eating and hanging out in good weather.  It's really a beautiful place with lots of space for a family or friends.  There is a great living room with stylish, comfortable furniture and a large downstairs den as well.  The kitchen is amazing.  Great stove, frig, countertops.  The kitchen in perfect working order.  It's really a tremendous value and location.  It's on a busy street, but it's quiet inside and there's a beautiful wood fence around the entire property, so children would be fine there.  Very close to good restaurants, coffee and pubs and not far from the freeway, but in a residential area.  The hosts were so kind and accommodating - helpful with recommendations and greeting, communication.  They even left a fantastic bottle of wine and chocolate!  I can't recommend this place highly enough for your next Seattle adventure.  "
1882316,13241209,2014-05-23,9565547,Tessie,"We had an outstanding experience at our ""Greenlake vacation house.""  We stayed for nearly 6 weeks with our two little ones during a remodel, and we were so glad we found this place!  It was spacious, spotless, well laid-out, and the kitchen appliances were brand-new.  And we very much appreciated the helpfulness and the gracious welcome from our hosts.  They made sure we had everything we needed and made it easy for us (especially with respect to the kids!).  We really enjoyed walking to beautiful Greenlake and the local playground and library; we also enjoyed walks around the quiet and charming neighborhood north of the house. While the house is located by a street that sees commuter traffic, the fence and yard surrounding the house provided excellent privacy and security for the little ones, and the house itself was always quiet.  The outside deck was a good place for play and outdoor dinners.  The garage was a nice convenience.  The house is well-positioned for access to the freeway, and to Aurora/99 which is great for downtown / touring.  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this house!"
1882316,13417947,2014-05-27,13917282,Deah,"Shehryar and Naureen were personable and responsive in all the communications regarding their lovely home near Greenlake. They make renting their home an enjoyable and uncomplicated experience. The house is comfortably appointed and has a great kitchen. If you enjoy cooking, you will appreciate both the layout and the quality of the appliances in this home. It is great home for a family reunion and would be particularly well suited for families traveling with infants as one of the three bedrooms is a fully equipped nursery. We stayed here with six people and the house easily and comfortably accommodate all us. "
1882316,13736455,2014-06-03,12360038,Carol,"My family and I were in Seattle for a family wedding and this house was perfect for us. It has 3 bathrooms and 2 comfortable bedrooms and a basement family room that doubled for another bedroom. The house also has a small nursery size bedroom that would work for a single sleeper. The house is spacious enough for a crowd and the kitchen is well appointed with all we needed for coffee, breakfast and snacking. We loved the location as we could walk to Green Lake, the local PCC market and restaurants. The house also has a garage and good off street parking, which was very handy. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at  Shehryar's house and would stay there again. It was perfect for us. "
1882316,14130359,2014-06-12,15956629,Nancy,"We enjoyed our stay at the Greenlake home.  It is spacious, clean, bright, and the beds are comfortable.  Only 7 miles from city center and a yoga studio within a mile.  Access to the home is easy and our hosts left a nice bottle of dry rose wine and dark chocolate (my favorite).  A TV in a common area would have been nice but we were on the go alot so not such a drawback.  We would definitely go there again if in area.  "
1882316,15812006,2014-07-16,10557960,Meaghan,The house was a good size and in a convenient location to Greenlake. We felt the home was very loud - floors creaked a lot and the home was on a very loud street as well.  The garage was not clean and very disorganized.  The house was clean and had all the necessary items.  Yard was also very small and not very clean.  
1882316,15958327,2014-07-19,2862049,Alex,"We couldn't have been happier with this rental. It was everything our family could have asked for. Our 2 year old loved the crib, the toys and puzzles in the rec room, the kids plates/cups/silverware, and the boat in the yard. We loved being near Green Lake and had more than enough space for entertaining with old friends. We will definitely be back! "
1882316,16973010,2014-08-05,13818723,Natasha,"The place was perfect for my family - 4 adults and 2 kids under 5.  It was comfortably furnished with a big, cool carpeted basement that the kids could really spread out with their toys (and the toys left by the owners) and play in.  The deck was lovely in the late afternoon to host some of our other relatives, and the outside toys kept all of the kids busy so the adults could talk.  The area around the house and the deck is fenced in, so there was no danger of children walking out to the street.

The kitchen is well stocked and conveniently laid out -- also with some plastic kids cups, plates, spoons, etc.  The 3 bathrooms were roomy and clean.  The beds were comfortable.

The location was excellent - every morning we walked the 2 (low traffic, residential, but long) blocks down to Greenlake and played in the nearby playground, swimming area, and grassy park.  There are lots of casual restaurants fringing that part of the park and we would eat in one of those for lunch.  

The only negative thing about the place is that it is on a street that gets a lot of traffic, and it can be a little loud with the windows open.  With them closed, I didn't really notice it, but at night we'd open up the windows to cool the bedrooms down.  There was a fan that we used in the hallway between the front rooms for white noise that helped.  No one had trouble sleeping because of this.

The hosts were very responsive to questions over email.  We found an iron in a closet and asked where the iron board was.  There wasn't one in the house, but they brought over a brand new one the next day!"
1882316,17155589,2014-08-08,1501018,Jessie,"The house was clean, well-equipped, and as described.  We were traveling with small children and the home was perfect for families:  there were toys, a nursery, swing, stroller, high chair, etc.  Overall a great experience.  "
1882316,17434253,2014-08-12,15181145,Penny,"I rented this house for members of my family for a 3 day weekend. I inspected the property when they arrived. The house is beautiful and spacious and sparkling clean. The kitchen is modern and well equipped. My bother Dave Wenger especially enjoyed the decks outside and said it was very relaxing in the evening.  He also said the location was convenient for getting to the airport. My niece, Kenzie Wenger, said ""The sheets were soft, the mattress was comfortable and I really appreciated the personal toiletries in the bathroom."" My nephew Sean Wenger said, ""Our family recently stayed at this property for a wedding weekend.  We loved the home!  The house is conveniently located near highways and gave us quick access to downtown Seattle.  We were impressed with the accommodations including a home theater.  The home is professionally decorated and made for a very enjoyable visit.  I would highly recommend this property if your travel plans take you to Seattle."" The hosts also left coffee and tea and chocolate bars as a gift. A very nice touch."
1882316,17684229,2014-08-16,16174521,Laura,"Naureen and Shehryar replied to my messages promptly and it was easy to find the house and gain access. Everything was true to photos and description, although not sure if the nursery could really be described as bedroom suited for an adult - the fold up cot in it was pretty small and would not suit a tall or wide person. Lovely neighborhood, safe and charming and easy to get to downtown via the 90 or the I-5."
1882316,18299500,2014-08-25,14164399,Tomer,Naureen and Shehryar provided an excellent home for my family to stay in for the days leading up to my wedding. The house itself was beautiful and clearly well maintained. We had a few questions about the house and Shehryar responded immediately to any issues. We were even allowed to store rental chairs for the wedding an extra day beyond our stay in the spacious garage. My family especially enjoyed that the home was a few blocks away from the Greenlake neighborhood and the lake itself.
1882316,18658929,2014-08-30,11421783,Nicole,My family had a lovely stay in Seattle. The home was clean and perfectly suited for families. Our hosts were very attentive. Would stay there again. 
1882316,18789627,2014-09-01,4147137,Peggy,"My friends and I had a comfortable stay at the house. For some, it was their first AirBnB experience so I'm very glad the house turned out as described and pictured. I definitely recommend this place!"
1882316,19025316,2014-09-05,3126481,Elisabeth,"Naureen and Shehryar's home is lovely. My parents stayed here the week before my wedding and we had enough space to fill all the gift boxes and host a family part on the deck. The house is clean, well appointed, and in a great neighborhood near Greenlake. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!"
1882316,19516843,2014-09-14,14600201,Lynnette,"My family and I came to Seattle for a wedding. We truly enjoyed our stay here at the house. It was very clean, comfortable and was a great space for 3 children. The kitchen is fully stocked with all utensils, pots and pans. We loved the decor of the house. There were toys for the children to play with and a cute ship on the deck. 
We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone who is interested to stay here. "
1882316,21204697,2014-10-13,3451393,Katharine,"The house was perfect for our group, which included two couples and one toddler.  The finished basement had a lot of toys for the little guy, and the kitchen/living/dining area was great for cooking, relaxing, and eating meals together.  There is a master bedroom with an en suite, which was nice for one couple, and another bedroom that's next to the kid's room, which had a crib, cot, and pack-and-play.  The neighborhood was perfect for walks around the lake, eating at a good mix of restaurants.  The hosts were great -- they made it very easy to access the house when we arrived, and texted right back when we had a question mid-visit.  We had a great time!"
1882316,21581912,2014-10-20,13711562,Dawn,Great house.  Close to the lake and major routes to city center. Great fenced in backyard!  Perfect for our little kids (ages 4 and 1.5).
1882316,21954947,2014-10-27,21017900,Mark,The house worked out great for us as a family. Close to the venue we all  attended. Everything was as advertised.
1882316,28501352,2015-03-24,16225635,Paul,House was nice and spacious with sufficient room for my family of 6 (including 3 kids). Location was central to where we wanted to go. Check in was seamless and easy. My kids really liked the toys left behind by the hosts. Nice family room at the basement.
1882316,30232407,2015-04-19,9169408,Princess,Great neighborhood within walking distance to cafes and Greenlake.  Spacious home accurately described and hosts were very easy to communicate with.  We came with small children and it worked out great - as noted in previous reviews it is a bit noisy from traffic but that didn't keep us from sleeping.  Would recommend this location to others!  It is a drive to downtown Seattle so it is easier if you have a rental car.  
1882316,30783079,2015-04-27,29344654,Frank,"Great experience. Everything was very well setup for us and it was the perfect place for our little one.. he had a blast.  Lots of space, nice outdoor deck, well furnished. Really enjoyed our stay. "
1882316,31172815,2015-05-03,27499847,Sara,The house was perfect for our family. It had a crib and toys for our 1 year old son. It was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with all pots and pans (even plastic ware for our son!)  Located in a great area- close walking distance to the park and the playground.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle-Greenlake area. 
1882316,31897187,2015-05-11,16154208,Saree,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to say it was wonderful. Naureen & Shehryar's house is lovely and in a perfect neighborhood near the park. This was a trip over Mother's day to see my daughter, we had a beautiful brunch on the deck and the baby had a great play area downstairs. I would definetly rent here again on my next trip to Seattle."
1882316,33667511,2015-05-31,6433656,Shiri,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and it had a lot to do with this incredible house. Our 3 year old didn't want to leave the play room, and we had everything we needed (and more!) for our baby. The kitchen is very well equipped, and we enjoyed cooking and having some of our meals at home. Our hosts were very helpful and responded immediately to all our questions and requests. Two little things you should be aware of: the house is located on a busy street and one of the bedrooms gets street noise; and from some reason the WiFi didn't quite work for us, but it didn't bother us enough to try and fix it so maybe there's a simple solution...
All in all a great, welcoming, place to stay! Made us want to stay longer... 
We will defiantly stay here again and warmly recommend it!"
1882316,35062588,2015-06-15,25648064,Margo,The listing was very accurate and the house is more lovely than expected!  Everything was clean and very well organized with plenty of kitchen items  and linens.
1882316,40420010,2015-07-31,12228834,Shinrou,"We (three moms & 8 teens and kids) had a very good stay for 6 weeks at Naureen and Shehryar's beautiful house. It was really nice to have the huge Green Lake park two blocks away. Wonderful for walking and running in the morning and evening. 
The house was better than we expected. It had four rooms in fact, three on the main floor (one master room, one standard room and one infant room) and one on the garage level. The house is well-stocked. We got everything we needed, plenty of towels, bed sheets, toilet paper, utensils, etc. But it is on a main street. Expect some traffic noise if the windows are open.
Naureen and Shehryar were very communicative and helpful throughout the process. Thank you for a great trip!"
1882316,41729766,2015-08-09,29917267,Janice,The house was great and hosts were incredibly responsive when we had a plumbing issue and when there was no toilet paper left at the house. Location was ideal. Price was great. We'd recommend this house to others and would stay here again. 
1882316,44753476,2015-08-29,1270694,Lisa,"This house was a great Airbnb for me and my family! Sure it had its shortcomings (on a loud, busy street) but for a family with a small child it really beat staying at a hotel. The house has lots of toys and a great little children's room with crib and changing table. The patio is great for relaxing or playing and the inside is very spacious with both upstairs and downstairs space.  

Naureen also went the extra mile and stocked the fridge with some key essentials like milk, juice, bread, since we were arriving late with a young child! Very nice not to have to run to the grocery store after a 13 hour flight! 

We'd highly recommend this house! "
1882316,45956713,2015-09-07,38354254,Kristen,"My husband and I, our two young children, and my brother and sister-in-law and their one year old enjoyed Labor Day weekend at this lovely house. The location was excellent, and the hosts have stocked it with everything you might need to feel at home. If you have young kids, this house is ideal because the hosts have supplied toys, a crib, bassinet, etc. for use.  As one review mentioned, the house does sit on a busy street, however, the entire property is fenced and there is a generously sized deck area to enjoy the outdoors on, so it really wasn't an issue. The house was ideal for our two small families and we will definitely rent it again! "
1882316,46818746,2015-09-13,43170555,Chengsong,"We had great experience living in this house! The house was neat, location was great, and the hosts were very kind and responsive. I really would recommend this listing for anyone staying in Seattle."
1882316,48279563,2015-09-25,680508,Amit,"Naureen and Shehryar were an awesome host. Very spacious and comfortable home in a safe neighborhood. They were reachable and whenever we needed anything they were quick to assist. We had an incident with the bed, and they were quick to fix it and did it happily. Very friendly people - I would definitely come here again. 
"
1882316,48788585,2015-09-28,44100326,Bryn,"The house was very clean and well equipped for families. The nursery was very nice to have for my son. There were toys in the basement and some on the deck. It's nice that the house is fenced in. The house is on a very busy street and you can hear all the cars going by. It was loud in the nursery and the bedroom next to it but with a sound machine and the fan, it drown out most of the noise. The floors were pretty creaky, which wasn't bad until I put my son to bed then we had to tip toe around the hallway. We had an issue with the sink backing up in the kitchen and the owners responded right away and told us they would take care of it. This was at the end of our stay so I can't say when it happened. There were a few places with exposed wired from old speakers and other electronics right at toddler level. We had a great experience for my family. I am very thankful that my son could play around the house and yard. I would recommend this house to others and stay again in the future. "
1882316,49612214,2015-10-05,38358261,Elizabeth,Listing description is very accurate.  The home is clean and very spacious.  Having 3 bathrooms for 3 couples was a bonus!  Beds were exceptionally comfortable.  The house is blocks from Green Lake and walking distance to a grocery store and restaurants.  Having the bus stop one block away was very convenient.  I would highly recommend this home.  Thank you Naureen and Shehryar.
1882316,50392733,2015-10-11,45826867,Ravi,House and neighborhood were good in general. Garage is not clean and it was hard getting in and out of the garage. Overall positive experience. 
1882316,55346916,2015-12-01,34925571,Nancy,Easy to reserve and access.  Great location - near lake and shops.  Very spacious.  Neat and clean.  Well stocked kitchen.  Would definitely stay here again.
1882316,57505244,2015-12-27,41944006,Donna,"This spacious house accommodated 3 adults, 1 toddler & a 4 year old. The playroom/media room was equipped with lots of toys & books for the little ones. We were able to use the media aspect because we had a computer which took some set up but got accomplished for a football game. No cable tv service was a disappointment. It appeared that 2 of the bathrooms had towel racks @ 1 time but were no longer in place. The foam soap on the sink needed to be moved to bathtub for bathing. Kitchen well equipped with dishes for kids. Location is convenient for a walk or run around Greenlake. We were able to park a small truck in the garage, snug fit but nice to be inside."
3316219,16211604,2014-07-23,2344601,Kelly,"We stayed in the downstairs unit at Gavin's. Located close to several bus lines to both downtown and the U District in the gorgeous Eastlake neighborhood, Gavin's place was the perfect space for our stay. The unit was spacious, contained all the essentials (including cookware, hairdryer, towels, etc.), was easy to access using the security coded doors and, with two bedrooms and two couches, allowed the three of us to stay very comfortably. 

The unit is also just blocks from Lake Union and nearby several restaurants, as well as the famous Voxx coffee and a few bars. It's also just a 20-minute bus ride from downtown, Pioneer Square, CenturyLink Field, Safeco Field, the waterfront and Pike Place Market. 

Gavin was very responsive and his manager Pushpa was available for any questions or needs while we were there. Parking was also available for those who will be bringing a car. Be aware that the house is right next to Interstate 5, so you may have to get used to noise but within a day or so we were used to it. Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend the space to anyone looking for an ideal location without being in the middle of downtown.

"
3316219,16725335,2014-08-01,17248407,Jacqueline,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay at this residence. The housekeeper, Pushpa, was readily available to answer questions and was very accommodating with our early check in and late check out. The room with 2 Queen sized beds was really a room with one Queen sized bed and a Queen sized mattress on the floor. The space did not look like the pictures. The location was pretty good but you really should have a car. We used Uber to get around everywhere. There is wifi but it wasn't the fastest. There are a few places to eat and a convenient store down the hill. Overall it was clean, not too noisy, and in a relatively good location. "
3316219,16987716,2014-08-05,16479245,Teruni,"The house was on a busy street and a little difficult to park and get in and out of driveway. The housekeeper was nice and easy to get in touch with. 
"
3316219,17137581,2014-08-07,1691176,Jonny,"Nice big space, convenient location.  The flat could have been cleaner and the wifi network was non existent. "
3316219,17779755,2014-08-17,13773650,Marcus,"Busy/noisy location near the freeway. Parking was a challenge, but we worked it out with other tenants and some car juggling. 

Unit was not as clean as I would have expected for the price (dirty towels hanging on backs of doors for example), and some maintenance needs to be done in the bathroom and kitchen to bring the unit up to snuff. We were unable to close the bathroom window, as it had apparently been 'painted open' instead of 'shut'. The window is alongside the back deck, which could easily be reached from the ground. This was a little unnerving to my wife, who wondered if we would be safe as we slept. 

I would suggest a modest investment in a plastic tray to help unjumble the mismatched flatware, and perhaps a set of matching plates/glassware for the cupboard. As it was, it seemed like all the kitchen utensils were purchased at Goodwill. It looked like a paint job had been done in the recent past, but I don't think the painters paid a great deal of attention to detail. That could be revisited to good effect.

The online photos look very nice and might be a little misleading. On close examination that only comes with actually being there, it didn't seem as clean/straight as the pictures looked. (I don't think that's deception on the part of Gavin: I'm just saying that pictures only tell so much and they looked nicer than reality) Someone more discerning than I might be disappointed.

Gavin was polite, responsive and pleasant, but our dealings were with his coordinator, who was 40 minutes late for our check-in (2:40pm), then wanted into the unit 20 minutes early the next day. She was polite, but it was mildly inconsiderate, given their *strict* check-out time of 10am the next morning. I understand that there were unusual circumstances that weekend, but given the lateness of our check in, I would have expected the courtesy of waiting until the agreed upon check out time to come knocking at the door.

The bedrooms/living room were fine and comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen could use some work. I would have been OK with all of this if the price had been more reasonable. As it was we could have stayed in a very nice hotel for the $200 we were charged.

It must sound like I was very unhappy, but I wasn't. The place was 'ok'. With a few improvements in maintenance and process I would upgrade it to a B. Drop the price to an appropriate $125 and I think Gavin has a very reasonable place to stay for a quick visit. At it's current state/price point, I don't think I would book again however."
3316219,18006701,2014-08-20,2191588,Mary,"I'm sorry to say that our stay was less than desirable.  The house, albeit old, was in a somewhat dilapidated state, especially where the plumbing was concerned.  Also, we don't think our bed sheets had been washed and there were small blood stains on the sheets.  The hot water handle on the bathroom sink is missing a screw so the ceramic handle kept falling off.  I think a youth hostel would have been more comfortable and clean. There was a towel in one of the drawers that had stains on it.  Super gross!"
3316219,18246169,2014-08-24,16744855,Solomon,The place was as advertised and easy to get to from the bus line. Thanks for having us!
3316219,18567316,2014-08-28,14612008,Lori,"Gavin is being very helpful. The space is clean and nice, located right off the highway. Slightly loud if the windows are opened. Love the parking space. Great experience overall. "
3316219,18612679,2014-08-28,1618279,Alex,"We stayed for a quick night at Gavin's after coming back from a backpacking trip on the Olympic Peninsula -- some showers, a dinner in Eastlake, and then fell asleep and left first thing in the morning explore the city -- and it suited our needs just fine. I should note also that we ended our hiking trip a day earlier than expected, so we booked Gavin's place last-minute in the afternoon of the day we planned to arrive; it was great to be able to find something so quickly.

It is right near the highway,  but we didn't have any problems with traffic or noise. Our main suggestions would be that the shower and lighting could be updated a bit (the place definitely looks better in the daylight of the pictures, but to be fair, we arrived at night and left early), and on a warm night it was a little hot with no fans that we could find and some windows that wouldn't open. I did call the manager Pushpa to clarify where we were supposed to park (the language in the house manual was a little confusing) and it went straight to voicemail -- but, it was a last-minute booking, and we didn't end up having any problems with it."
3316219,18631547,2014-08-29,13080888,Sara,The place was in a convenient location and clean and tidy - great for our quick one night stay.
3316219,19042762,2014-09-05,5066833,Torin,"My trip to Seattle was amazing and it wouldn't have been possible without Gavin. The house was beautiful, clean, and just a few minutes from down town. It was right off of the 5 making it so convenient to get to, didn't have to worry about getting lost in a new city. The drive way was big enough for 2 cars (if you really squeeze them in there) which is impressive for being so close to down town. Although I did not personally meet Gavin, he had amazing response time and was vary helpful with questions I had. If I visit Seattle again (which I plan to) Gavin will be the first place I look!"
3316219,19205406,2014-09-08,18442041,Carly,"Gavin's place suited our needs perfectly, as it is situated in a convenient location and was a short walk from where our family we were visiting live. It is right nearby the I-5, but we didn't find the noise to be a problem at all. "
3316219,19365157,2014-09-11,17544546,Elizabeth,A tad disappointed! Water pressure in sink very bad! Kitchen old and inadequate! Windows didn't close! TV didn't work due wifi down! No clothes iron. A little bit away from life (25 min walk) all in all very disappointed as this was my first and worst airBnb experience  
3316219,19537799,2014-09-14,4798026,Jonathan,"The house was a mess when we arrived at check in. The house keeper didn't come until two hours after we checked in. 

There is NO wifi and if you tell Gavin about this he will begin to read his laundry list of excuses of how it's not his fault or problem but either yours or the internet providers... neither of which is was (because I called the company on his behalf). 

The shower leaks on the ground.

The windows are propped open with no way to lock.

The floors feel unswept and mopped, which makes me even more concerned about if the sheets are actually changed. Seems like the cleaning lady just spot cleans.

The location is really great. 

There is lots of space for plenty of people to have a nice comfortable time.

The pull-out is literally a giant mattress you pull out of the closet in back... but that frees up an extra couch.

Honestly, I'm tired of AirBnb hosts thinking they can buy properties, rent them all out to make an income, evade tax laws of the hotel industry because of this, and just treat their guests with no respect. WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS, NOT HOMELESS PEOPLE YOU ARE PUTTING UP FOR FREE. Gavin spoke to me like I was indebted to him for some reason and yet made no effort to seem conscientious that his lack of care and misrepresented amenities created an awful amount of trouble for us as working professionals trying to make a quick weekend getaway home for a reunion possible amidst our busy work schedules.

If you just want a party house and don't care about anything but a place to crash and pack in a ton of people in a good central location, this house is a perfect rent for you. Just don't tell him how many people you have because he'll never know anyhow. When we asked him if he could come by to help us with his archaic wifi router, he insisted it'd take hours since he in not in the area but he could send his house cleaner by, who was a very nice woman, but he expressed directly as ""not able to understand technology, even basic email communication was difficult"".

Anyhow, we are happy people and still were able to look past everything, but don't believe the hype. This is just a conveniently located place to drop your stuff off and go find the real beauty of Seattle elsewhere.

3316219,22508545,2014-11-08,23094280,Kira,The house was clean and has a lot of character. It was a perfect place to stay for a few nights and in a cool location. 
3316219,22780325,2014-11-14,2734499,Jason,Good stay. Exactly what I was looking for. 
3316219,23118527,2014-11-23,150705,Anne,Gavin was a very gracious and laid back host. He was nice enough to bring us more towels. The apartment is relaxing and it posesses a quaint charm. You can hear some road noise but that did not bother me. I liked the neighborhood and being so close to the lake and some cute houseboats. 
3316219,26789404,2015-02-19,3832424,Natalka,"It was a great time to stay for a girls night in so cozy and spacious apartment. It is very nice, vintage and close to restaurants. Thanks Gavin! "
3316219,27419890,2015-03-03,28483510,John,"I had a last minute trip to take family from AZ to visit Seattle for a site seeing and possible future move, so finding a place close to downtown and easy to access was great! We arrived late after touring the back roads from Portland to Seattle and enjoying the Bremerton Ferry view of the city. I received info from Gavin in a detailed text message while out of phone service and had everything we needed to access the house. The apartment was clean, neat, made beds and towels ready. A great last minute find for a quick overnight trip. Gavin offered places to visit in the neighborhood, but we had a short schedule to get around the city. The best part was off street parking and walking straight into the apartment. No, parking 3-4 blocks away and taking everything out and repacking in the morning.

Great access to Pike Street, Space Needle, Capitol Hill, and beyond. I would stay here again. "
3316219,27478631,2015-03-05,2156955,Mark,"The place was nice, with typical old place ""quirks"" (lack of electrical plugs, somewhat placated by extension cords placed here and there, squeaky floors, old school kitchen etc), and the photos are very accurate (though now they have some nice dark leather couches instead of the white cloth ones shown in the pictures. 

I had trouble (my own doing) getting in, Gavin was available by phone quick and walked me through it. Place was SUPER CLEAN, and though it is almost right next to the I-5 highway, wasn't too bad on noise, especially in the back bedroom.

Kitchen is well stocked - dive into the cupboards and you'll even find a hand blender, mixer, lots of bowls and stuff to cook with, good amount of glassware, etc. There's even candles and such to light up in the evening if you want. 

Be aware - there's a TV, but nothing plugged (there was a remote for something to access netflix, but couldn't find the actual thing to make it happen). If you bring a Chromecast, you're set.  

Internet speed was okay. Horrible going up (I tried to upload my photos to the cloud storage, that was mission impossible) but good enough down to your computer to watch netflix or something else.

Overall, a great deal, for a reasonably close stay to ""the happenings"" in Seattle - 2 blocks down a hill and you're in the Eastlake village area. Hop in your car, drive on Boylston / under the highway, and you're a few minutes away from 12th and the Broadway Capitol hill neighbourhoods. 

Recommended, and I'd stay here again."
3316219,27501134,2015-03-06,17476259,Rachel,Very convenient and centrally located!!! Worked out perfect for our one night in the city!!!!
3316219,27879038,2015-03-14,73188,Celina,The apartment is spacious and easy to get to. We drove so don't know how convenient it is for public transportation. The code to get into the apartment door didn't work but the host responded right away and sorted it out. The wifi was spotty and slow at times. The upstairs guests were loud and running footsteps could be heard all afternoon when one of us stayed in. We didn't actually meet the host but he was helpful and quick to respond via the app. We had a great trip to Seattle.
3316219,28166923,2015-03-19,9854858,Sarah,"All in all, the place was as expected from Gavin's posting.  The rooms were spacious, furniture was comfortable, linens were all clean and sufficient. The kitchen was well stocked and clean. The neighborhood was great, and perfect for us as we were visiting family down in the Lake Union houseboats.  Some cute and delicious restaurants within easy walking distance.   The floors are extremely dirty and need a major deep clean.  Also the traffic noise was quite loud.

As for Gavin as a host, he was quick to respond to my questions leading up to the trip; however, didn't really answer all my questions, and we had a pretty big mix up over the correct code to enter the unit, and whether the Pack n' Play would be there.  He gave us the code for the upper unit, though we were renting the lower.  I wrote back to get the information straight and didn't get a clear response from him until after we had arrived. Then when I told him there was no crib, he told me to knock upstairs, and if they don't answer to just go in.  I didn't appreciate that, and wondered whether he'd tell them to do the same if they needed something from our unit.  We did eventually meet the upstairs neighbors and sorted it out, but it was a rocky start.   

There are a lot of pro's to the place, but I wouldn't book again.  The deal breakers for me were the dirty floors, traffic noise, and poor communications .  "
3316219,28232076,2015-03-20,20170005,Cynthia,The place was very spacious. I liked that the beds were a good size and the rooms were comfortable to stay in. The area it's in is very green and had many paths to go running on. It was quiet during the evening and is conveniently close to down town Seattle. 
3316219,28294196,2015-03-21,18777251,Alexandra,Great place to stay! It is close to everything. Had a little difficulties with the door but it all worked out Gavin walked me through it on the phone. Highly recommended!

The bathroom is really old and pretty gross, but if you can get past that, it's a reasonably priced place to stay close to all of Seattle's best sites. I'd recommend this to anyone who isn't picky and just wants to be close to downtown without spending over $150 a night. "

3316219,28879517,2015-03-31,22192882,Tracy,"Very convenient location a few exits away from Pike Place and a short drive to the freeway. This is a duplex where people are renting upstairs and renting downstairs. Please verify which unit you are staying in. There was a mix up during my stay. It's not really the best feeling rushing from dinner and being told you need to ""get your stuff out of there right now"". The place is dirty with hair all over the restroom floor. The cleaning fee is going to the cleaners but they aren't doing their job thoroughly. We arrived early and waited till our check in time and the cleaners still weren't done. It was really cold and the heater wasn't working even though I cranked it up higher than recommended. I wouldn't stay here again. "
3316219,29056955,2015-04-03,28843034,Miguel,"All and All a great experience. Gavin was on point with all my needs and most importantly he was quick to respond with any of my messages. House is Located in a perfect location. Close to the party scene in Capital Hill. If working out, getting exercise is more your thing, the famous Howe(Lakeview blvd & Howe) stair sets are right around the corner. You can find many active locals there. Those stairs are no joke. Intense workout with a great view of the lake and city. I would gladly return to Gavin's place for my next Seattle trip."
3316219,29435197,2015-04-07,8385402,David,This character home was neat and clean. The beds were soft and we slept soundly. No tv and we did not miss it. Wifi works great. Super location and we loved the neighbourhood. No complaints.
3316219,29607157,2015-04-10,19544441,Amy,"This location is very convenient to the lake, access to the interstate and near downtown. Very easy to get in and out of traffic but with a close in location. Very comfortable.  It was nice to have a few amenities in the pantry. This place could only be better if a TV was available- but not necessary because of its great location. "
3316219,30009822,2015-04-15,22114111,Samuel,"The place was great. We had to book it the day we needed it, and everything ran smoothly. Clean and spacious, would stay at Gavin's again for sure. "
3316219,30247747,2015-04-19,17973807,Gonzalo,"The house is located in a great neighborhood just blocks from Union lake. It is also few minutes driving from both city center and downtown Seattle with is covenient.
It is really easy to get the house and also check in because of the keypad doorlock on the front door, so just virtual contact with the host.
The house has 2 confortable queen beds on separated rooms and 2 extra mattresses for additional guests. Nevertheless the pictures must be updated, living room looks completly diferent, no tv at all and brighter than it really is. The bathroon is ok with a good shower but the kitchen is not. 
The house was fine for a weekend but If you are planning to stay longer take into account that there is no dinning table neither washing machine.
The hard wood floor looks older and there is lack of maintenance. Oh something really important is that is difficult to find and electrical plug.
"
3316219,30734689,2015-04-26,667175,Minori,Gavin was really great with communications. The duplex was clean and spacious. It was at a great location to go downtown by transit or car and we are happy to have a big corner store and good restaurants within a block or 2. Thank you!
3316219,30817364,2015-04-27,31091379,Uli,The apartment is clean and spacious. Beds are really comfry.  Location is great. It is a good place to spend the night while you are exploring Seattle. 
3316219,32015488,2015-05-12,4514077,Laura,"The place was great, clean and in a great area, parking is helpful in Seattle.  I would stay again!

"
3316219,32183696,2015-05-15,1404652,Tim,"Although I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Gavin, he was truly remarkable with his organisation and attention to detail. He also fielded ad hoc requests and questions with a much-appreciated sense of humour. The house itself was also fantastic: spacious, beautiful and well-maintained. It was the perfect spot to explore Seattle - close to the water, a lovely  long walk to Downtown along the water and a short stroll to Capitol Hill."
3316219,32218146,2015-05-15,19649459,Erik,"Had a last minute trip to Seattle and needed a place to crash for the evening. Was able to book Gavin's space the day of our stay with no hassle. Unit is well appointed, comfortable, and clean. Having dedicated parking in Eastlake is a huge bonus. "
3316219,32510756,2015-05-19,18683075,Aileen,"Booking was simple and easy. The place was clean and spacious, however, it was a little too big for 2 people. We didn't have any shower problems so it was great. We love the location of the place because its right next to the highway and everything we did was about 5-10 minutes drive. We did rent a car and it was quite a challenge to park outside especially during rush hours. Also, I think they remodel the house or something because it looks pretty different than the pictures. The pictures on website is brighter and nicer."
3316219,33366427,2015-05-27,5452222,Amanda,"We stayed in this 2BD split level house for 6 nights. It was very easy to find the place and gain access upon arrival. The heating was very confusing and while there were instructions, we didn't figure it out. The pictures were not accurate to what we saw when we walked in. The decor is quite different in the living room (brown couches). Overall the place was clean and the host was responsive. When we arrived,  the light in on of the rooms was not working. We informed Gavin right away and he responded, but unfortunately he did not come and fix this during our stay -- which would have been nice so we could see better at night. The location was convenient and and overall we enjoyed our stay.  "
3316219,33488447,2015-05-28,9270685,Kristin,"Nice, clean home. Booking was easy and straight-forward. Plenty of space with comfortable beds. Right by the interstate which was a bit noisy, but also convenient. The Eastlake location was great. "
3316219,33797511,2015-06-01,8660139,Kyle,Great experience at Gavin's. All the information was easy to understand abs everything was where we needed it. Would totally stay there again if I ever come back!
3316219,33975495,2015-06-02,31352559,MEghan,"For a last minute booking I was very impressed!  Joshua was a very prompt gracious host.  His place is very close to downtown Seattle, just a short bus ride away.  This place is amazing for the location and price and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area.  "
3316219,34011320,2015-06-03,32982169,Adventures4Life,Gavin's home was very spacious and comfortable. The house had everything we needed. The parking space was a huge bonus for us! Booking was quick and simple and the host was very responsive. 
3316219,34552654,2015-06-09,33058930,Thomas,"We enjoyed our stay! 

The directions and access to the apartment were clear and professional. Good location and we very much appreciated having a kitchen."
3316219,34711408,2015-06-11,8824116,Jamie,"Good experience, house as described. A bit tricky to find extra bedding but sorted out quickly. Very good overall. A bit expensive for the area. "
3316219,34808425,2015-06-12,18298669,Albert,The neighborhood was very convenient and the place is exactly as described. Access to the place was seamless and we did not have any issues. There is plenty of character in the home. The beds were very comfortable! I would definitely stay here again in the future. 
3316219,35066291,2015-06-15,1805362,Todd,Good communication and as advertised. Great location.  
3316219,35277039,2015-06-16,34521356,Laura,"Easy and close to the highway, but slept 5 not 6 with one person on a mattress that was in the closet. 6 would have to been, well...ah?

 Summer time isn't the greatest as almost all windows were painted shut and it gets warm

Nice clean paint and linens and booking was easy and fast. House is old and quaint, but limited. 

Good crash pad, but we didn't spend much time there other than sleeping, because of limits, but Seattle and neighborhood has lots to see. 

Photos are the house, but not decore. "
3316219,35465037,2015-06-19,31621080,Theresa,"A little gut honest feedback for you.  First off, I thought I was working with Gavin Walker and don't quite understand who Joshua Dotson is.
The pictures you've got posted show a light and traditionally furnished home. The photos show furniture, bedding and shower curtains that are all very different than what are now in the home. The home feels dark; the pictures are very deceiving.  There is no mention of the actual location being right next to the highway.  The traffic noise was very loud and made it difficult to block out while trying to sleep. Maybe a television or radio could have helped alleviate some o the traffic sounds.  Finally, the lock to the actual rental is difficult to figure out both in entering and relocking."
3316219,37047351,2015-07-04,31759572,Mj,"This home met our needs beautifully when we were recently in Seattle for our niece's wedding.  The location was phenomenal - about 10-15 minutes from Seattle city center. It was also an easy walking distance to Starbucks every morning :) Our unit in the house has a spacious, clean, comfortable and fully equipped kitchen, family room, two bedrooms and a good sized bathroom - all with lots of natural light and large closets. It felt like home and added great enjoyment to our trip. There's a great deck on the back of the house;  easy check in and check out. One comment: The house is best suited for 5 or fewer adults. There are two double beds and a twin mattress that we set up in the family room - all very comfortable with lots of extra bedding. However, the couch was a bit small for an adult to have a comfortable night sleep. Otherwise, this property was just what we were hoping for.     "
3316219,37538055,2015-07-07,7165620,Nathaniel,The house is in a great place to get around the city. The space is large and accommodating. The living space is open and inviting and the bedrooms comfortable. It would have been an even nicer experience had there been a table to sit and eat at. I loved the back deck but wished there had been some place to sit (especially given that there is no AC and the temp was nearly 90 outside when we stayed). Overall the price was fair and the space inviting as advertised.
3316219,37952823,2015-07-12,16882088,Katie Gray,"The property managers (Gavin, Joshua? Gavin & Friends? Joshua & Gavin's Big Adventure? Etc.) do a fantastic job keeping this place beautiful. They were very prompt in answering my questions and the check-in/check-out process was straightforward. Great location. 

A few things were bothersome:
-It doesn't sleep 6 comfortably. 5 should be the max. The particular couch in that space isn't made for sleeping. 
-Secondly, this listing does not have a fully-equipped kitchen and the oven is sorely outdated. Our group planned on making a big breakfast together and it was rather tough to do. 
-The refrigerator froze our food. Boo.
"
3316219,38354820,2015-07-14,13795298,Gordon,"I never met the host. The apartment is indeed spacious and economical. It's in an older house; some of the floors slope pretty markedly, it's easy to trip in a few places, and there are even fewer electrical outlets than most places of this age (and some of the lights were missing bulbs). Most windows can't be opened; while Seattle has a mild climate, it was pretty warm some of the time we were there. Parking is a definite plus. On the other hand, the house is right across from I-5. Noise wasn't too bad, but the view, the closed windows, and the sparse furniture didn't make us want to spend time there."
3316219,38427989,2015-07-15,22083305,Ashley,"This was a really cute place. It's an older house but we found that charming. It is right by the highway but the noise didn't bother us, and the convenience was appreciated. Having parking is always a plus, and checking in was a breeze. Would stay here again because of the great price! "
3316219,38498553,2015-07-16,6715741,Rachel,"The house was exactly how it was pictured and exactly what my group needed! The bed in the first room was THE most comfortable thing I've ever slept in. Only issues: back door was open when we arrived, not sure why and the sink handle in the bathroom was broken...but all minor issues. Joshua was very responsive when we thought we'd need to arrive early and getting into the house was a breeze with the door codes.  Thanks for the crash pad!"
3316219,38692790,2015-07-18,26438677,Martha,"Honestly this place was not worth what we paid. It looks very contemporary from the picture, but the place is very old and needs some work. Mostly though our issue was cleanliness. None of us felt comfortable taking off our shoes as the floors were dirty. The bathroom had a huge ball of hair on the floor and the hand towel hanging in the bathroom (brown) had a huge rust- colored stain on it (bleach or peroxide stain??). There were other towels to use (white) but one of them had a handprint on it. We had 5 people so when we arrived (10:15pm) we looked for the mattress in the closet. There were no sheets available for the mattress so we called Josh to see if we could get some sheets. He gave us the code to the basement where there are supplies. When I went down, the light  was on and there was a man down there (cleaning guy??) who handed me sheets. Kind of scary! Each bedroom only has one outlet which is behind the bed so you have to move the bed to plug in anything which in the summer is the fan because in the main bedroom and in the living area the windows do not open. You have to use the kitchen plugs to charge your phone. There were coffee grounds in the coffee maker. The shower is an old tub with 2 shower curtains surrounding it so when you are showering the curtains suck in on you. We did not have a ""lake view"" and I do not know how 6 people could sleep there unless someone sleeps on top of the couch which does not look comfortable for sleeping. This house is right next to highway 5 which is convenient for getting around but that is the biggest asset."
3316219,39176259,2015-07-21,34554250,Mei,房间年代老，设施旧，有个房间的灯坏了，住了三天一直没给更换。离高速近，噪音大
3316219,39309182,2015-07-22,28116455,Betsy,"Logistics and communication with Joshua were quite easy and we had no problem finding or getting into the place. However, the apartment was much darker than the pictures showed (as many of the reviews implied). It was fine for one night but I wouldn't have wanted to spend much more time there. "
3316219,39386728,2015-07-23,1640715,Monica,"Cute house, GREAT BEDS! We felt very comfortable here, all 6 of us- 1 on a couch and 1 on a pull out bed. Easy to hop on the freeway to get anywhere. "
3316219,39561106,2015-07-24,4334186,Kiron,"Josh was communicative and helpful. The place came as advertised. However, as other reviewers have noted, the house is very close to I-5, and one of the bedrooms can be a little noisey. Overall a pleasant experience."
3316219,39734847,2015-07-26,26019950,Jennyfer,"Overall our group had a nice stay. The general consensus was the location & amenities served their purpose. Since our group rented both sides of the duplex we were able to have double the room to roam and relax which was excellent. Our only problem unfortunately was the cleanliness of the floors. Our feet were black from the soot/dirt. We found this problem in both units sadly. There were also misc items in the fridge (roast beef, ice cream, half container of juice etc) from previous guests. We did find everything to be accurate from the photos and enjoyed the central location. The house has it's charm and we very much appreciated having a comfortable bed to sleep in. The linens that were provided were great as well. The door key pad was a great feature and had no problem accessing either unit or the front door. Parking was also a plus. "
3316219,40067391,2015-07-27,22654008,Karen,"We arrived at the place an hour after checkin to find the cleaners still there but finishing up. The place was clean, but some windows didn’t lock which made us uneasy leaving bags. The code we received for the front door was the same code as our unit, which also made us a little uneasy knowing there was another rental unit on the upper floor. We unfortunately woke up to some random guy we didn't know entering our unit at 4am, which really freaked us out. He left quickly, seemed confused about which unit he was supposed to be in, but we still were super unsettled. We couldn’t sleep after that and left quickly in the morning. We texted Joshua and he apologized, but we hope that he remedy's the situation."
3316219,40090403,2015-07-28,32720477,Ruth,"Joshua was very helpful. The 2 bedroom unit was quaint, clean, and comfortable. It was very convenient to the concert we attended in downtown Seattle. We enjoyed our overnight stay!"
3316219,40388617,2015-07-30,33646857,Brian,"Josh's house was pretty much as advertised. The house was clean and everything worked. Surprisingly , the nearby freeway was not noisy... We didn't even know it was there!"
3316219,41320591,2015-08-07,14543862,Hussain,The house is ok. They get it cleaned before you use it which is essential. It's a very old house and the floors creek as you walk by and the doors don't shut properly. But the amazing thing is you can park 3 cars easily. On another note I had to call the cleaners to come do some fixes around the place as there was lacking electricity points and lamps etc. but they came promptly and did the work in a very acceptable timeframe
3316219,41610787,2015-08-08,24543737,Jonathan,"Joshua's place was clean and comfortable although the location wasn't ideal due to its proximity to the highway. The keyless entry made it convenient to coordinate check in and check out. The house was older with peeling paint and old bathtub set up didn't make for ideal showers. Overall, the place met our needs for shelter but we wouldn't likely stay here again."
3316219,42378341,2015-08-13,14543862,Hussain,Host was good and gave instructions in advance. Had no issues with my second stay. They made sure that my trip was smooth. Thanks
3316219,42822114,2015-08-16,30021934,Barbara,"We were very unhappy with this rental. It was supposed to sleep 6 but that meant 2 people had to sleep on a single mattress pulled out of a closet. It was misrepresented. The living room had seating for 4 with different furniture. The kitchen had 2 chairs, the bathroom sink did not drain, the tv did not work. I went to a hotel. When I complained to Joshua he said that this rental was not a hotel. Lots of busy traffic on the street but that is something I should have researched. Don't stay here!"
3316219,43099675,2015-08-17,17250932,Sijie,Thank u Jousha~这是一次非常棒的体验，各方面都准备好了，很方便。第一次订BnB，一切都自便。
3316219,43497724,2015-08-20,10416594,Chansu,"We weren't very safisfied with the rental as Joshua was not very responsive (missed calls, took a few hours to reply multiple messages), the photos were not very accurate either. The floors were creaky, the TV didn't work for a while, the lights were very dim.. Overall, our stay was alright as the beds were comfortable, but other than that, I was quite disappointed with the rental and I wouldn't come here again.."
3316219,43976834,2015-08-23,25508381,Victor,"This was a very unpleasant experience. The bathroom smelled, with drains and toilets that backed up, and had two towels for 4 people. The place reminded us of our sophomore apartment- barely any of the lamps worked, the floors squeeked, and the neighbors partied all night.  The bathroom light was connected to a fan that was louder than the traffic of I5, just outside the front door.  We conacted him several times to ask for towels, with NO response.  Does not make a great Seattle experience."
3316219,44358546,2015-08-25,30062707,Meagan,"Our stay was great. The description was accurate. We had a little trouble with the TV, but Joshua was very helpful. We enjoyed our time!"
3316219,44624723,2015-08-27,41858751,Brittany,Amazing place! Had a lot of fun and Joshua was so great for our last minute craziness.
3316219,45066473,2015-08-31,33134125,Mary,Access code accurate. Overpriced. 2 double beds that need replaced. Toilet sitting on reinforced boards. Looked like an outhouse. Ancient tub okay. Only update was living room but very cheap furniture. No TV access.
3316219,45525214,2015-09-03,5246011,Sarah,"We had a decent experience with this space. We are from Seattle and know it well, so we recognized the value--it's a great neighborhood, super central with parking included at far less than your average hotel. That said, this is far less than your average hotel. Its a great crash pad, a great place to store your stuff and shower and sleep, but if you are looking to hang out and cook meals, or chill on the couch, this is not your spot. The bathroom and kitchen are very dated and look like they could use a deep clean, and the bedrooms are not nearly as nice as pictured, though the beds were comfy and the linens clean. The lamp in the living room didn't seem to work and there was a random shoe left on a table.  A decent  value, but not a great spot if you're looking for more than a place to lay your head. Our host was accommodating at the last minute and the cleaners were very friendly. "
3316219,45772992,2015-09-06,28492808,Dave,"Would not recommend this place at all. Outlets and wires are falling out of the wall, the sink is missing a knob, paint is coming off the wall in big chips. House is right next to highway which is very noisy. No welcome book. But the icing on the cake was the party that happened upstairs until 2:30am and they left the front door wide open. Traveling with my 3 adult children from SF- who have stayed in over 50 Airbnb's combined and they all agree this was the worst Airbnb experience they have ever had. Stay away! "
3316219,46359609,2015-09-09,43607551,Amanda,"We only used this place for a bed to sleep on overnight, but it very much felt like a home and I was very pleased to be staying there rather than a hotel. I wish I could say that we used the facilities, like the cute little living room, or the kitchen (which was nicely stocked for convenient use), but we didn't. It was extremely efficient to have a code for the door rather than a key card or a key, I was worried about losing something like that. The thing I liked the most about staying there was the parking space. I drove up to Seattle, unlike most travelers who come by plane and transit, so it was nice to have spot for my truck without having to find parking on the street or pay for a garage."
3316219,46683045,2015-09-12,15178770,Kexiang,"Location was good, near highway to everywhere. The air condition seems a little problem which the temperature always high. "
3316219,46803399,2015-09-13,794950,Erika,"The keyless entry made check-in/out very convenient. 4 of us were comfortable in the apartment. Seemed like a good value for the area. Very convenient to a Zipcar lot, which made a big difference to us."
3316219,47366415,2015-09-18,5872079,Ian,"Clean, quiet apartment that was in a nice neighborhood convenient to our friends in town. Close to the interstate but no trouble with noise, even with open windows. "
3316219,47602010,2015-09-20,36670718,Kelly,"Had a great time at Joshua's. The place was clean and he was a friendly, attentive host! "
3316219,48053942,2015-09-22,12027169,Kevin,"Joshua's home was comfortable and welcoming!  Best nights of sleep I've had in a month.  Check-in and check-out was very easy, and having a dedicated parking space was a definite plus.  The house is well-located, near restaurants and markets on Eastlake and easy walking distance to the north tip of Capitol Hill."
3316219,48260534,2015-09-24,6341145,Marshall,This is a great location and beautifully appointed large 2 bedroom with a great kitchen and a private deck. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended to explore seattle from this quiet but close neighborhood.
3316219,48977805,2015-09-29,38269322,Marta,"Very easy to book, great communication, and convenient no-key access. The house had a great location near the highway that played a large role in our decision to stay here. The house had basically everything we needed: a tea kettle, hairdryer, towels, toothpaste, etc.  However, the photos don't really exhibit how old the house is (over 100 years). A little TLC would definitely bring the house to its full potential. Still very grateful for the ease of booking since our previous host cancelled on us. "
3316219,49415306,2015-10-03,14249222,Justin,Great house in great shape. Would rent again
3316219,49522835,2015-10-04,43699026,Charley,"The place was lovely, well kept, and easy to get to. I would recommend this location to friends."
3316219,49851803,2015-10-06,43010974,Kayleigh,"Joshua's place was fantastic! Everything was very comfortable, and it was tastefully decorated in a way that really brought out the charm of the house.  Check-in was incredibly easy, and the kitchen was well-stocked (the large tea kettle was a plus!) I would happily stay again."
3316219,50339521,2015-10-11,32636940,Jeny,"Blown away at how convenient this spot was! Sweet little coffee shop and market on the corner.The apt was quiet, comfortable, and cozy vibes. Roku made for late night entertainment. The 3 of us loved the place! Joshua was super responsive and friendly in every interaction."
3316219,50983115,2015-10-16,14898710,Molly,Everything was great! Spacious and cute  charm to the place!
3316219,51183998,2015-10-18,45304053,Melissa,"Joshua's unit was great. Very comfortable, clean and centrally located. My friends and I traveled to Seattle for the Seahawks game and it was the perfect location, close to downtown and close to capitol hill for dinner, drinks, etc. Easy check in and check out and I hope whoever stays there next enjoys the shampoo and conditioner my husband forgot to pack. haha"
3316219,52346630,2015-10-28,28289270,Gabriela,"We felt very welcomed during our trip, the neighborhood was great. The are some pretty convenient places down the hill, a good bar, a nice breakfast restaurant and a convenience store. "

3316219,52907612,2015-11-02,47116756,Benjamin,"Very spacious and clean, in a good location near restaurants, bars and shops. A bit noisy next to the highway, unexpected problem with the plumbing in the sink and bathtub, but overall a good experience. "
3316219,53280452,2015-11-07,24955840,Graeme,Great location. Had everything we needed. 
3316219,53670325,2015-11-10,3588025,Oliver,Joshua provide excellent communication as we had a last minute request for his accommodation. The place was adequate and for the most part pretty clean. 
3316219,53738358,2015-11-11,3588025,Oliver,Josh had great communication with us as we needed to book his place again while we were up there for work. Place was for the most part pretty clean and was a good place to crash for the night.

3316219,55131842,2015-11-28,16762393,Jiasheng,Great house. Right next to a bus stop and enough supplements to make a thanksgiving dinner!
3316219,55600278,2015-12-02,15008484,Kelby,"Needed a quick place to stay to escape the fumes of a newly painted room in our home and found Gavin's 2 br for a reasonable nightly rate. It was clean, well furnished and homey. Despite being near a freeway, we could hardly hear any noise inside. Great pad for a night or a week. "
3316219,56340078,2015-12-12,35003320,Dina,房间是百年老宅，温暖舒适。
3316219,56437162,2015-12-13,50529399,Shawna,Great location and super cute. Parking was better then we expected since our rig was a super large SUV. The lights in the living room a little too dim for the liking and half lamps did not work. But great communication. Would totally book again. 
3316219,56802710,2015-12-18,42157214,Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay here in Seattle. The house was in a very nice location, close to shops and restaurants, and the bus service was easy access into the town centre. The house came with everything we needed, and was comfortable and homy. It definitely made our stay in Seattle much more enjoyable!"
3316219,56961217,2015-12-20,34289229,Felise,"The place was well-stocked with kitchen ware and toiletries. The surroundings were very serene, and very accessible by public transport."
7077910,41978601,2015-08-10,36688292,William,"The place was very large, neighborhood was quiet and convenient. Clean and wonderful place. Dina was extremely helpful when we needed help. 

Awesome place. Went for TI5. Would definitely stay there again. She gave us directions and was communications in answering us was too notch."
7077910,42911648,2015-08-16,14654046,Jamie,"Dina was an incredible host! She goes above and beyond for her guests and has a wickedly quick response rate for questions. 

The house was so charming and spread out with more than enough room for 6 people. There is a really nice energy in the house as well! The neighborhood is great and very easy to get around. I definitely recommend it. "
7077910,43707599,2015-08-21,32905496,Alex,It was simple to get in and settle down in this cute townhouse. Dina was communicative and accommodating!
7077910,46994971,2015-09-14,923776,Kathy,"Dina was great. After a last minute cancelation of another airbnb, she was able to accommodate us in her home on short notice. The place is great, along with the location. Coffee shops, the locks, restaurants all within walking distance. She was also very easy to talk to and quick to respond to my questions."
7077910,48745073,2015-09-28,42716615,Ed,"Dina was a wonderful host. We were in Seattle for a golf trip and she gave us excellent recommendations for golf, places to eat in Ballard, etc. The location is fantastic near the locks (a must-see) and restaurants. "
7077910,49899675,2015-10-07,20898482,Carol,"The house was in perfect condition when we arrived, and the host provided the information about the home in an e-mail and in person.  There were many goodies in the fridge.  We loved the location because it was convenient to my son, and we could walk to the Locks and the downtown area of Ballard.  The neighborhood was wonderful."
7077910,52096802,2015-10-26,32668698,Candy,"Dina was very helpful to us even prior to our arrival. She was cooperative and willing to permit an earlier arrival time. Although we didn't end up needing the early check-in, she was very flexible and responsive to our request. Dina checked in with us a few times during our two week stay and was responsive to our questions throughout our visit.

Overall, we were happy staying at the Ballard townhouse. The location is fabulous. We were a short walk to the library and a variety of restaurants and shops. The locks and botanical garden are also a short walk away. The year-round farmer's market is fabulous. Be sure to get the doughnuts! They are the best. The location couldn't be better to access all of the fun of Ballard. 

While we were generally content with our stay, we were intially taken aback by the state of the townhouse. While it was obviously cleaned for us (baths and kitchen tidy, floors swept and vaccuumed, beds freshly made, fresh towels placed in all baths) , it looked a little ""worn"". The walls were banged up (many marks, patched but not painted in a variety of spots) and the carpet had many stains. There was only one picture hanging in the whole house with a number of empty picture hooks throughout. The house generally has the feeling that someone lived there but moved out and left a bunch of stuff behind.

There were several issues with the master bedroom. While there is an overhead ceiling fan and light, the light was not functional. There was a post-it with instructions for the overhead light but at the bottom of the note it said the light may not work so just use the lamps instead. There were two small lamps for lighting but only one lamp worked. Fortunately, the closet light worked. Another issue with the master bedroom is that one of the closet doors had fallen off and was standing in the closet. As this was a safety concern for our two-year old, we had to move the closet door to another safer location. The dressers in both bedrooms were generally not usable. The drawers were either stuck or without bottoms all together. The master closet had nice shelving that we could use and there were some hangers in the closet.

The kitchen generally had all that we needed with some searching. The kitchen cabinets were full which made it challenging for us since we were staying for two weeks and had brought a few things for our temporary home. We were able to rearrange the cupboards a bit to make space for our items. There was a vareity of items for cooking such as oil and salt and pepper which was very helpful. We were very pleased to have a washer and dryer to use.

While the Ballard townhome is in a great location, has a lovely host,  and easily accomodates a large group/family, aesthetically it could use some TLC.

7077910,52971722,2015-11-03,30071215,Aubrey,Dina's house was a great find for our trip! It truly felt like staying with family.

We truly appreciate all the accommodations for our stay!
7077910,55193951,2015-11-29,41941782,Ashley,"Had a lovely time staying with my family at the townhouse. It was very nice and clean and was fully furnished with everything we needed to for the week we were there. We were even able to cook thanksgiving dinner without any issue! The location and just overall functionality of the townhouse was great, and I would definitely look forward to another opportunity to stay here. Thanks so much for letting us use your home!"
7634011,41692007,2015-08-08,39835084,Terry,"This was a quiet, peaceful neighborhood one block and a half from the Mountains-to-Sound trail which was great for running in the mornings.  It was also within walking distance from Capitol Hill and the restaurants and other attractions in the area.  Jeremy was a great host, providing amenities and asking if anything else could be done or provided.  Jeremy respected our privacy, but made himself available when needed.  This made our first trip to the Pacific Northwest most enjoyable."
7634011,42625488,2015-08-14,1473302,Joel,"The house was very nice and well equipped, we really liked the neighborhood with a lovely park just down the block and a short walk to a bridge with a great view of the bay and the city"
7634011,43145330,2015-08-17,40403464,Ryan,The place was very clean with fresh paint and not too far from the main downtown area. Enjoyed my stay in Seattle!

We had everything we needed in the house, extra towels, blankets, etc!

7634011,47333698,2015-09-17,44137534,Nick,Was able to accommodate on extremely short notice. The location was a trip saver. The house was comfortable and clean. The host was a quick communicator as well. Very recommended.
7634011,47438463,2015-09-18,28519576,Luke,"The house was not clean when I arrived, the beds were not made, and it smelled like Marijuana. Jeremy did not answer when I called. My group made the best of the situation, and Jeremy offered a refund, but this was not the best of airbnb experiences for me."
7634011,47942686,2015-09-21,35818974,Scott,House was very clean and instructions were easy.  Thanks Jeremy!
7634011,48484980,2015-09-26,42809004,Kathy,"The house was dirty every where when we arrived. The owner promised let me get a refund, but he didn't do that at last. 
"
7634011,48601717,2015-09-27,44039445,Casey,"It was very welcoming. The neighborhood was a little shady though. I would definitely stay there again, the price was good :) "
7634011,49827735,2015-10-06,17573959,Evan,"Easy instructions, great location,  and an all around great place to stay if passing through with a family or small group. We really enjoyed our stay at Jeremy's!  Thanks for the hospitality."
7634011,50422438,2015-10-11,45873283,Teon,Nice place. Jeremy gave me all the information I needed and just let me and my family do our thing. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Everything I needed was there. Thank you and would recommend :)
7634011,51187436,2015-10-18,43041391,Jesse,"Definitely an awesome place to stay at, used uber and the train system to get around.
I would definitely consider this place again when I come back to visit Seattle."
7634011,52314369,2015-10-28,1246955,Mari,"Jeremy was easy to communicate, and the place was nice and clean when we arrived. Nice cozy place to stay, every thing in the listed discription was prepared. I would stay here again !"
7634011,52563467,2015-10-30,46723857,Emma,This place was great. Got in on really short notice and everything was very clean and hospitable. Easy access to getting around town and very quiet. 
7634011,52648807,2015-10-31,5578076,New,Jeremy made us feel very welcomed and comfortable. He made himself available for any questions we had. The home is amazing and very comfortable. Shower nice and hot at a great pressure. Rooms are very cozy and the design of the home is really unique and fun. Great attic. Equipped with everything you could need. 
7634011,53788152,2015-11-12,48290176,Jason,"Very cozy place, chill neighbourhood. Excellent place if you do not mind walking to the trendier areas of Seattle. Jeremy is quick to respond to questions and provided easy instructions. My friends and I all felt at home, would definitely recommend this spot."
7634011,54303341,2015-11-17,32619377,Rob,My friends and I needed a place to crash after a work meeting in SODO and Jeremy's place was super convenient. Jeremy was easy to communicate with and everything went swimmingly!
7634011,55107566,2015-11-28,18392496,Natalie,"Booking this property was very easy, and Jeremy was great for accommodating our family's situation/needs! The house was simple and spacious, had a lot of character, and was great for 6 folks.  Location is great, too!

Unfortunately, we we very dissatisfied with the condition of the house; it was under-stocked and unclean. Specifically:

-  Only two windows had shades, so a general lack of privacy and light blocking. 
-  One of the beds lacked a comforter (it had a couch throw/small blanket), so we had to borrow bedding from friends in town in order for two adults to have enough cover for sleeping in the double bed
-  We had to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels (there was one partial roll of each, for 6 adults over 4 nights)
-  There were wadded up hairballs in the corners of the bathroom, by the tub
-  The tub had not been scrubbed, and was covered in a dull coating of soap scum
-  The dishwasher had clearly been run with dish soap (instead of detergent), and was filled with sudsy water. We drained and toweled it out about 10 times, then ran the rinse cycle several more (it took most of a day to get it cleaned). This would have been noticed had the cleaning team opened it before we arrived.
-  We even tried to clean a bit, and found no vacuum for the area rug in the front room (rugs need to be vacuumed, not just swept).

Finally, there was no contact with Jeremy when we were there, even when I inquired about the internet password. We would have appreciated a response to solicited help. 

I really hate to leave bad reviews; I am usually very flexible and happy to stay in places of varying conditions, but this one was just too much."
7634011,56651862,2015-12-15,51209025,Breeona,"The house was simply amazing. Everything inside was beautiful, I would consider buying the house I liked it so much. Everyone who entered said he same, ""wow where did you find this!"". I'm very thankful Jeremy were able to renting for us so quickly and easily. He was pleasant the whole time, a wonderful experience for my friends birthday! Thank you Jeremy."
7634011,56988165,2015-12-20,51434896,Yihui,Nice house. enjoyable and comfortable
7634011,57470079,2015-12-26,2720111,Deborah,"The house was just what we expected, charming and easy. However, we never actually stayed there as my son's friends made us comfortable at their home. "
7634011,57786792,2015-12-29,49112956,Alex,Absolutely perfect location. House was still being developed but had all the necessary comforts.
533443,1552632,2012-06-24,634985,Anne,"I had a wonderful stay in Max's West Seattle Hideaway!  When I called Tom to find out the best way to get from the airport to his place, he arranged to pick me up!  Tom was a perfect host & I felt like a personal guest and was at home instantly.  His place is charming, impeccably clean, & comfortable - and Max was friendly and exceedingly well behaved. The neighborhood was quiet and lovely. Public transportation to get into town - where my conference was held - was less than a block away, and it only took about a half hour each way. Very easy. When I came back in the evenings, there was always warm tea available, and even hot chili on one rainy evening. Very yummy and much appreciated!  The balance of privacy and connection was perfect. Thanks so much, Tom & Max!  "
533443,1564082,2012-06-25,1750509,Katie,"Tom and Max were great hosts!  We arrived way later than intended from Vancouver due to border waits/bad weather and the change in arrival time was not a problem at all for Tom.  We were greeted by Max, the amazing friendly dog that lives in the home, fresh sheets / towels and bottled water.  Tom offered us a light breakfast and coffee if desired.  Bed was super comfy and the entire place was spotless.

Really great stay!"
533443,1572618,2012-06-26,2144780,Sandra,"I was greeted by Max the dog and immediately fell in love with him. Tom was a gracious and generous host. The place was very clean and nicely designed. The room had closet space, a large mirror and a TV.  The bed was comfortable--I had a good night of sleep. I think you'll love checking out West Seattle and staying at Tom's house and visiting with Max. I would recommend this location. Thanks again, Tom! "
533443,1616340,2012-07-02,2717815,Daria,"We enjoyed the weekly stay at Tom's place. The house is clean and very accurate and has everything you need. This is very quiet and nice place for living. The location is good, near food store and a bus stop. Tom is a great intelligent guy and always helpful for any need. For sure we will stay once again with him."
533443,1661385,2012-07-08,45374,James,"Max's place worked out perfectly, tasteful, clean, comfortable, convenient to Alki, SEA, and not far from downtown by car. Tom was a great host, supplied water/towels, stocked fridge, coffee. He made us feel at home, his dog is truly fortunate to have such a great best friend. 
"
533443,1757926,2012-07-20,2949816,Claudia,"Tom was a great host! He was really friendly and promptly answered any questions we had. Our room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed to have a wonderful stay in Seattle. We felt very welcomed in his home. 
Also, Max, Tom's German Shepherd Beagle mix, was the star of the show.....and he knows it. Max is one of the sweetest dogs I've met!
I definitely recommend staying here!"
533443,1772936,2012-07-22,2884274,Joelle,"We stayed one night just before flying back home. 

The place was very clean. We came in to be greted by  a very friendly and well behaved Max. (He didn't jump up or insist on licking you but he was more than happy to recieve pets.) Our room was nice and comfortable. We would have been happy staying in that space for a longer time. 

Tom was very nice and we had a great talk about camping places we could go to on our next trip out to Seattle. He also helped us negotiate directions and timing for making our early flight the next morning.  He was happy to talk when we were and gave us privacy when we were ready to get ready for bed. He balanced it well and we never felt like we were intruding or visa versa. 

The neighborhood looked good, but we didn't stay long enough to give a real review on that. 

Would definitely stay here again!"
533443,1780972,2012-07-23,2860460,Tammy,"As usual, Tom is a excellent host and the house is wonderful to be at...especially when you are tired. I am a medical student doing my internship at a facility in West Seattle and my home is in Auburn. Going to school all week from 8 to 4 and then working double back to back shifts on the weekends......I was afraid I would fall asleep at the wheel.....
Staying at Toms one night a weekend is a GOD SENT!!!!! The house is only 10 min away from the facility. I feel safe where I park and safe in the house...even if Tom is away that weekend. Thank you for making it possible for a poor working student who needed a safe, clean, nice place for me to stay....and of course...I love the dog as I have o leave mine constantly with my mom!!! House is beautiful and tastefully done inside. Really comfortable!!!"
533443,1840577,2012-07-30,2860441,Hope,"Tom was the perfect host.  I stayed for a week and Tom gave me run of his small, immaculate home in West Seattle.  It was a good location for me since I was exploring the larger Seattle area and suburbs looking for places to live and things to do.  Tom has early mornings and works during the day--and Max was great company when I was there alone.  I was initially a little concerned about sharing the bathroom--but Tom left space for my things and it really did not turn out to be an issue as we were both in and out at different times.  High-speed wifi worked perfectly.  One of the most comfortable beds I've every slept in and plenty of closet and dresser drawer space in your room. Convenient Keurig coffee maker--plenty of extra fridge space.
It is not within walking distance to downtown Seattle or stores, restaurants if that is what you need."
533443,1873391,2012-08-02,1516544,Jenna,"Tom is the perfect host""! We stayed for just two nights but felt very welcomed and comfortable- a home away from home. The house is immaculate and he has great taste in furnishings. The house has a cute porch out front and nice garden. It is in a great neighborhood in west Seattle, you really don't even need to go downtown unless you've never done the tourist thing. I love west Seattle, with all the parks, beaches, great food, bars and shops. And it's just a quick jaunt across the bridge if you feel like heading to downtown. We had full use of the house, laundry, kitchen ect. Breakfast was great in the morning with coffee and teas- this is definitely a great perk that he really doesn't need to offer- great value for money! Tom is a great guy and very interesting to sit around and chat with.... But his dog, his dog is the main attraction"" what a great dog Max is- I will cut it short but Max will steal your heart it's guaranteed!! 
I would definitely stay here again if I was in Seattle and I would recommend this place to everyone visiting the city. Great place! Great person! Great dog! "
533443,1895460,2012-08-05,2633071,Benoit & Angela,"Max's Hideaway was fantastic and Tom was a great host. We checked in much later than usual, but Tom accomodated us quite well and had everything ready. We would definitely recommend Max's Hideaway."
533443,1920515,2012-08-07,3014098,Bill,"      Tom's house is in a nice neighborhood.  Easy to find and near lots of stores and restaurants.
The house is charming and his work on the front and back garden is coming along nicely.  House is spotless and very nicely decorated.  Tom was a great host.  Pleasant to talk with and quiet at times.  Bedroom was perfect....clean and decorated very tastefully.  Max was a most excellent and patient guard dog."
533443,2007373,2012-08-16,1738836,Tomoe,"We had an amazing time in Tom's house! Tom is great host, and we felt so comfortable. House is clean and a room was enough space to stay for two people. And his dog, Max is super cute and lovely!! Thank you very much, Tom and Max!! "
533443,2016459,2012-08-17,735469,Sam,"Tom's place is one of the best values out there. Super clean place, comfortable bed, great dog, bananas and oatmeal cookies? How can you resist?:)"
533443,2034979,2012-08-19,1740869,Annalisa,"our two-night permanence at Max&Tom's was simply perfect. the house is very clean, simply but warmly furnished, in a safe area very well connected to downtown Seattle (about 20 minutes, and the bus stops just around the corner).
Tom is a really nice and wellcoming host, willing to give advices without being intrusive. Plus, he has a wonderful, sweet, always tail-wagging dog!
We definitely suggest to stop by Tom's place, either you're visiting Seattle or you just want to recover from daily distress sitting in the front or back yard!"
533443,2040061,2012-08-20,2860460,Tammy,I wish there were more nice people around like this gentleman!

533443,2095138,2012-08-25,3295929,Aga,"Tom is a great host.
His house is charming, comfortable and clean.
Commuting to downtown Seattle is fast.
I will definitely stay at Tom's again when visiting Seattle.

533443,2173197,2012-09-02,1917427,Carene,"Tom is a really friendly guy and his dog Max is just adorable. His home is immaculately clean and comfortable and so is the room on (website hidden) and wifi in the room as well as clean fluffy towels and a yummy breakfast. He let us use his kitchen and laundry (thanks Tom!) and email communication was always prompt and helpful. The bus was so easy! A 2 min walk from the house and it's a direct service (felt like a 15-20 min ride). If you are planning a trip to Seattle you have to stay here, it's the best value for money around."
533443,2203519,2012-09-04,3300357,Anton,"We only stayed with Tom for one night, but it was really great! His house was beautiful and extremely clean, his dog Max was super friendly, and he was very accommodating and friendly during our stay. Tom offered us good advice on where to look for apartments in the area, and also just gave us the scoop on local places to visit after we had found a place to live. I would definitely recommend staying with Tom if you have the opportunity."
533443,2239274,2012-09-09,1866871,Mark,"Tom and Max were great hosts! The home was very clean and nice. The bed was very comfortable for a queen size (we have a CA King at home) it was our vacation so we got a little closer. Tom had great wifi & a flat screen tv in our room, also had a dresser and closet. He also had oatmeal & yogurt and waters available. It was also nice to relax in the living room. Tom was very nice to talk to. He was informative about places to see and how to get there. He also had travel maps for the area. Max the dog was very friendly. The home was conveniently located easy to find. It was a great place to stay and next time we're in Seattle we would go back."
533443,2255605,2012-09-10,240474,Erin,"I stayed with Tom in September of 2012. I was visiting with my boyfriend at the time, who happened to be in his first week of quitting smoking. I was personally very stressed and it could've been the perfect disaster of a weekend. Thankfully, Tom was an amazing host and his home provided the respite I needed from my boyfriend and from the long drive. 

When we arrived, Tom was working on the deck. I had started major work on my deck in the few weeks prior, so we had a lot to talk about -- and Tom was amazingly helpful in that regard, even though it was well outside of his host duties.

His home was clean, comfortable, and quiet. I'm not a dog person in the least and was pleased his dog was so friendly and easy to get along with. Tom also provided breakfast in the morning, which was quite the treat.

This was a fantastic visit and I only have good things to say about Tom and his home. I'm trying to think if anything could have been better and nothing comes to mind, which is unusual for me. :) Thank you, Tom!"
533443,2275771,2012-09-14,2132939,Neal,"Our visit with Tom was our first night in Seattle and he and Max made it as warm and comfortable as can be.  Tom is a perfectly pleasant host and the location is easily accessible and just minutes from downtown Seattle, the airport or Boeing field.  I recommend the Hideaway for anyone traveling through this area."
533443,2336390,2012-09-18,383591,Burcu,"First of all, I fell in love with Max. He was the sweetest dog ever. And of course Tom, is a great host. Thanks Tom for everything.

533443,2402736,2012-09-24,1190672,Kevin,"Good location, easy to get into downtown Seattle.  Max will great you at the door whenever you come to the house, but he's one of the most well behaved dogs I've ever met.  The house is clean and cozy, the bed is comfortable, and Tom is easy to get in touch with.  I'd stay again."
533443,2485425,2012-10-02,2196574,Robert,"We had a fantastic stay with Tom! My girlfriend and I stayed for a week while searching for an apartment as we moved to Seattle. He was incredibly accommodating and helpful with everything we needed. Overall, Tom is a very friendly and generous host who I would recommend to anyone. Also, Max is fantastic and well trained too!"
533443,2609938,2012-10-14,3830338,Russ,"Perfect room, host, location, and dog.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, clean, and comfortable place to stay.  Thanks!"

533443,2792556,2012-11-03,3686312,Christopher,"I had a great visit at Max’s West Seattle Hideaway.  I stayed for one week and found everything as advertised.  Max (and Tom) were great hosts, the bed was very comfortable, and the home was clean and well taken care of.  "
533443,2877935,2012-11-13,2261043,Socorro,Tom is courteous and considerate.  He called me the day of my stay to tell me he would not be there and where the key was located.  
533443,3071368,2012-12-11,4303738,Cynthia,"Max's Ia a charming petite cottage, I had the place to my self as To was away with a death in the family. The bed was great, The 1st minor challenge was I had never used ""kerrig"" coffee maker. Took me a few minutes to figure it out, then It as there fresh coffee for me. Such a clean neat little house. Thank you.  "
533443,3293367,2013-01-06,4500024,Sandra,"Picked the best place to have my FIRST airbnb experience.  I stayed a week and enjoyed every moment.  Tom is a wonderful host, and I felt comfortable and safe.  The place was spotless, the bed better than mine at home.  Max really did steal the show.  I am nervous around dogs and I was smitten within the hour.  If I find myself in Seattle I know I will check to see if Max's place is available.  Thanks Tom and Max for making my stay so great!"
533443,3348971,2013-01-14,1033318,David,"I enjoyed staying with Tom for two nights. 
Communication up front was great and once I was there he helped my organize my trips to the city, print out tickets and even provided me wit fruit, tea and oatmeal :-) 

I felt like and would stay at his place any time again. 

Thanks,
David "
533443,3377465,2013-01-20,3427184,Derrick,"The house was clean and well-maintained and that made my stay a very pleasant one. Getting into downtown and around was easy with the bus system in Seattle.
Tom was a great host. He tried his best on my request for a pickup from the airport despite his work schedule and I didn't have to wait long for him. Though we didn't spend much time together during my stay, we had fun cooking up a storm one evening in the kitchen, chatting and watching TV. 
Max was very friendly and was always there to give me a big, tail-wagging welcome whenever I got home. Simply a delightful company!"
533443,3417024,2013-01-26,4167835,Carrie,"Convenient location, 20mins to downtown! Nice house, big and comfortable. Max is so cute  Tom's place is clean and tidy and Tom is helpful and nice"
533443,3591836,2013-02-19,475230,Lily,"I moved away from Seattle about two years ago but still visit one weekend a  month. When I come up I generally have a place to stay in a friend's guest room or at their place when they are out of town. Sometimes neither is an option, which was the case on my last visit up. I found Tom's place available at the last minute and booked it for the night. As it happens I had no plans for my last evening there so I stayed in and got to hang out with Tom and Max, his sweet dog- what a great pair! His place was clean and comfy and the room was lovely. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and give them and their place a glowing review...."
533443,3718444,2013-03-07,2044562,Amber,"wonderful clean home on quiet street. Tom is a wonderful host who is very welcoming and thinks of the little details that improve any stay. And his dog Sam is just the sweetest, most well behaved dog I've had the chance to meet. Good location half way between the airport and the city."
533443,3888798,2013-03-25,4825074,Xiao,"Tom is very friendly and he has a nice dog. The bedroom is prepared and even with breakfast and key on the bed (we arrive very late that night).

I have to come back in a couple months to Seattle, and i am looking forward to stay at Tom's Again. By the way .. Tom's dog is so amazing! I wish I could have him!

Thank you so much TOM and Max!"
533443,4038566,2013-04-04,5656564,Jimmy,"This was my visit time using airbnb and it couldn't have gone any better. Tom and Max (the dog) were great hosts and very accommodating. 

If you are traveling through the Seattle area I would recommend staying here.  "
533443,4101638,2013-04-09,3484549,Edomyas,"Tom & his dog Max were such wonderful hosts. I had some great conversations in the evenings with Tom about all sorts of world affairs, one time over one of his home brews. Tom was also really helpful in figuring out the lay of the land and even lent me his giant Washington State map book. 

The room was nice and clean, with a really comfortable bed, and adequate closet space. Even though it opened into the living room, there was a lot of privacy.

Overall, I had a great experience."
533443,4176687,2013-04-15,421442,Eren Emre,"I drove up to Seattle from San Francisco. It was a pretty tiring road trip and I didn't have a place to stay in Seattle. I found Tom's place using the iOS app. His reply was faster than Airbnb's notification emails. After 15 minutes of booking, I was at his place, he and Max warmly welcomed me. 

Definitely recommended."
533443,4241298,2013-04-21,5958391,Gabriel,Tom was very hospitable and made our stay in Seattle very convenient with his flexibility around our trip. The house is very comfortable and clean and a great deal for the price. And the bed was great too! It was super comfortable and hard to get out of. It was great to have a simple breakfast available and the option to cook if we wanted. Max the dog was also very welcoming and super mellow. His home is located in a quite neighborhood and it's a quick drive to the downtown area or other neighborhoods around town. I definitely recommend staying with Tom and I would easily stay with him again if we're back in Seattle. 
533443,4252915,2013-04-22,5680783,Elyse,"Tom was helpful - the space was comfortable and clean - and Max was also a pleasure to meet! We were only there for one night but Tom accommodated everything we needed and he was a genuine, nice host! "

Such as breakfast, information & advice. I went to Seattle downtown and back to his home very late on every night. Tom always left the door light on. If I go to Seattle nex time, Tom's house has my priority. "

533443,4734257,2013-05-22,578809,Brian,"Tom takes pride in his west Seattle Hideaway. This is a steal of a deal that you shouldn't pass over. This place is ideal if you have a car. It's not right downtown but it's not far either. As all of the previous commenters stated, Tom keeps a very clean home and Max does his share to keep it clean too (maybe the odd stray bit of fur here and there ;) There is also a great sense of community in his neighbourhood. I would stay with Tom again in a heartbeat. Thanks again for a great weekend!"

His place was super cute, and the bottled water and coffee were greatly appreciated it. I'm bummed I didn't get to meet Max! It was a perfect stay, and I would definitely stay again when back in Seattle. "
533443,4893038,2013-05-31,2939655,Matt,"We stayed with Tom (and Max) for two nights, and we had an amazing time. Tom was super nice and encouraged us to explore the city. We enjoyed the coffee and oatmeal provided to us. Tom obviously cares about his guests and goes out of his way to prepare his home for them. Finally.... Max is adorable. He is very well behaved and always brought smiles to our faces. We will be sure to visit Tom and Max the next time we are in Seattle, and I highly recommend this room for future travelers."
533443,4995820,2013-06-06,2250351,Elena,Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Max and his owner Tom. Room was extremely clean. Our needs were anticipated very well by great host. The dog is most well behaved pet I've seen!

The house is conveniently located, very close to the airport and a short ride into the city. We found lots of supermarkets and shops nearby. 
It was really nice to meet Tom, the communication with him prior to arrival was great, too. He is a very kind and relaxed host! His dog Max is adorable and very well behaved. Even if you don't like dogs, you will like Max for sure.
If we ever return to Seattle, we'll definitely stay here. Thanks - Danke Tom!"

He had everything prepared as to make our stay comfortable including a coffee and cereal breakfast with fruit. We liked our clean and cosy room and spacious bathroom with ample towel supply.
Tom is a very talented host. He also  helped us substantially in getting on with public transport to the city. On our second stay a few days later he gave us a lift to the airport - fee was announced before - which made things for us very convenient. We had easy and entertaining conversation with Tom. We liked his very friendly dog Max, too. We can highly recommend Tom's place."
533443,5736069,2013-07-14,2069223,Mavis,"Tom is a very thoughtful host. I came to his place late and he left the lights on for me. Was very sorry that I get into the wrong room and woke him up, but hopefully didn't bother his sleep. We stay for 2 nights. The room is neat and the location is not too far from the city center.  Max is really a friendly dog!! My friend and I are very enjoy the time we spent with him!  I'll recommend Tom's place for others!

The host Tom keeps his place immaculate and it was a pleasure to stay in such a conveniently located home, close to the airport as well as to Alki Beach.  This was our first Airbnb experience and we are looking forward to many more similar stays.  Because Tom is very busy, be sure to coordinate arrival time with him before leaving home.  Also Max is a delight!"
533443,6142657,2013-07-31,462590,Paul,"Tom is a fine host - the room was clean, the bathroom was clean, the entire house - clean and comfortable. There was plenty of street parking available and his place a solid value for the economically-minded traveler.

533443,8789831,2013-11-18,375825,Stephen,Tom was a great host! He was very friendly and provided everything you could need from an Airbnb stay. Tom was also great with giving suggestions on things to do and places to visit during my stay in Seattle. I would easily recommend Tom's place to a friend.

It was really great- the room was comfortable, the neighbourhood was fun and our hosts (Tom & Max- woof) were super friendly, respectful and helpful (ie. provided some sweet tips for brunch and sightseeing). Our whole experience with Tom and Max was very positive- if we go back to Seattle we would for sure try to get in contact with Tom again!"
533443,11086416,2014-03-19,13080467,Joe,Unfortunately we were only able to stay one of the two nights we had booked with Tom. Overall the experience was great. Juli especially liked visiting with Max. Would definitely recommend to stay at Tom's place
533443,11527454,2014-04-06,8389786,Philip,"Tom was a very kind and accommodating host. I reserved the room for two the same day we were to check in. Tom responded quickly and, even though he was returning home from a trip, he got the place ready for us within an hour. He did not mind that we left and came back to the place late at night and let us stay and sleep in. The house is decorated with much taste and has interesting and unique pieces."
533443,11629974,2014-04-09,13894543,Simone,I stayed with Tom & Max for 3 nights and it was my first airbnb experience. Everything looked exactly like on the pictures and was super clean.

Communication was good right from the time of the booking enquiry. Max is a great dog with a wonderful temperament and I didn't hear a peep out of him - not even when I stopped scratching his belly. lol. The room is well set up - bed is super comfy. The whole house is very tidy and clean. Tom offers breakfast of oatmeal, fruit and yoghurt which is great. I was leaving super early the next morning so he made sure I was ok with how to use the keurig, what was available for breakfast etc before I went to bed. Great experience, and I will certainly be back if I'm in the area again, will just have to make sure I stay longer so I can get out and explore more!"
533443,12940007,2014-05-14,15387900,Ty,"A great quick getaway to Seattle included a night at Max's.  Tom was terrific!  It was a lovely little tidy home with a super comfy bed and darling dog ""Max"".  He was an excellent host and totally made us feel like it was home and he was a long time friend.  It's conveniently located right off a main artery but the street itself was very quiet.  Highly recommended if you are planning on being in the area.  We explored West Seattle a bit and had a memorable breakfast at a little place Tom recommended and also discovered en route back to the main part of the city, the very charming and AWESOME ALKI beach!   Tx again Tom!"
533443,13189273,2014-05-21,11569355,Lesley,"My 1-week stay here was delightful. Tom was considerate and helpful, the house charming and spotlessly clean, bed very comfortable, neighborhood quiet and safe. It truly has a ""hideaway"" feel to it -- and yet it couldn't be easier to get around Seattle, with city bus stop two blocks away and a short ride to commercial centers with express connections to downtown Seattle. I used the bus a lot. Max is also a great ""host""... very sweet, well-mannered dog! "
533443,13300178,2014-05-24,15428014,Jay,Tom's house was super clean and pleasant. His dog was super friendly and well trained. Great experience

It's in a nice and quiet neighborhood and it's only a short drive to Downtown Seattle. I can totally recommend this place :)
533443,15011964,2014-06-30,1733490,Colene,"Max is a great host, very quick with his communication and confirmation of our stay which was a bit last minute. He was also flexible with our arrival time since we were driving from Vancouver. His place is exactly as pictured and that bed is a dream. It was almost like sleeping in my comfy bed at home which is really saying something! I highly recommend Max's place to others. "
533443,15237277,2014-07-05,16911097,Andy,"We stayed in Tom's lovely home for 4 nights, thoroughly enjoying his insight into local activities, further afield activities and generally his company. The room and breakfast were perfect, the shared space is kept very clean and Max is adorable. Not having a car or wanting to drive in seattle (who would choose to!?) is easy from here too, with a regular bus taking you to down town in 20 minutes.
I would highly recommend a stay with Tom."
533443,15772881,2014-07-15,12814548,Blaine,"Tom's place was great! His place was super clean, the neighborhood was nice and quiet with plenty of street parking, and his dog is ridiculously well behaved and super nice! Oh yeah and the bed was comfy! I would recommend staying here to anyone! "
533443,16114331,2014-07-22,17070624,Jen,"Tom was a great host! We were in town for a short house hunting trip; and this was our first Airbnb experience. Tom made sure to give great advice on locations, traffic, and great local spots. He struck a perfect balance between chatting and letting us take a nap :) He has a beautiful two bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood (with a few young kids in the neighborhood) that is really convenient to the freeway. We would definitely stay with him again and recommend him to others.

And, of course, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the sweet dog Max. He'll be your best friend in return for a belly rub. Never heard him bark once. Most well behaved dog EVER. Although Tom is a modest man, I think he definitely had a lot to do with that."
533443,16269551,2014-07-24,17758544,Sami,"Le logement est très calme, très propre et très accueillant.
Tom est vraiment super sympa
Je recommande "
533443,16567699,2014-07-29,17304409,Catalina,"Neat and clean house, very comfortable room, exactly as described. Nice front porch for sitting outside. The house is just two blocks from a metro bus that goes downtown or to connections with anywhere you need to go, and two blocks from a convenience store. The host was most helpful with instructions for arriving, and provided brochures about the city. Also enjoyed the company of the adorable and well-behaved dog, Max. I  felt very much at home and would definitely stay there again."
533443,16626997,2014-07-30,17433878,Erin,"We felt comfortable staying at Tom's house. It was very clean and breakfast was provided, which sustained us on our early flight. Max was great to have around. We did not have much time to enjoy the outdoor space, though certainly would have if we did."
533443,16696555,2014-07-31,7557049,Jason,This is a great clean house and Tom is a nice thoughtful host. I had one night here and there are easy public transport options around. Max is also a super nice dog and well behaved!
533443,17073626,2014-08-06,18590906,Astrid,"Tom was a great host! The room was great; comfortable bed, good facilities and breakfast was available too. Furthermore, Max was a cutie and Tom was willing to help out with whatever we needed. He had some great advice for our trip in and around Seattle too. Would definitely recommend!"
533443,17168032,2014-08-08,16479611,Natasha," My daughter and I stayed for 2 nights at Tom's place and we felt very comfortable. It's a beautiful house, very clean.
We would definitely stay with him again and recommend him to others."

533443,17299054,2014-08-10,17271008,Neil,"Sometimes you enter into a space and it just feels like a home. After a week of backpacking in Olympic NP, my girlfriend and I could not agree more about this and Tom's hideaway. He was the most gracious host; responded to text messages very promptly; gave us some secret tips for backpacking cooking; and an absolutely divine recommendation for our last breakfast in Seattle. We will definitely be staying here the next time we're in Seattle."
533443,17394421,2014-08-11,18688842,David & Donnas,"As this was our first airbnb experience we were a little nervous about sharing space with a stranger.  Our fears were put to rest immediately upon entering.  Tom had everything in order and texted us information about entering in his absence.  While Max barked at hearing someone on the front porch, as soon as I said his name thru the front door he got quiet.  When we entered, he happily greeted us and was the sweetest dog ever (as others have shared).  Even my non dog-loving husband was smitten!  The house was cute and spotless, the room looking just as pictured (complete with green sheets and the breakfast tray).  Wifi is available.  Both the front and back porches offer outdoor seating areas.  Even on the hot days, the breeze going thru the house kept it really comfy, and the fan by the bed was a nice surprise as we use one at home.  We didn't meet Tom until late at night when we got home after attending a baseball game, but he stayed up a little longer so he could chat with us.  In the morning we were up, enjoyed our coffee, oatmeal & yogurt while he slept in, then had a great, relaxing visit with him, talking about world travels and sharing some life stories before we packed up to leave.  Super comfy and relaxed!  Thanks Tom - we would stay here again if doing things in this area."
533443,18195541,2014-08-23,10148869,Andrew,"This was our first Airbnb experience, so we didn't know what to expect, especially when it was a private room with a shared space. But the moment we stepped into Tom's house and saw the room, all the worries were gone! 

Tom wasn't around when we checked in, but he left detailed instructions for us. Max welcomed us in; he was very calm and friendly. The house was lovely and clean. Our room was exactly like the pictures you see on here, complete with a breakfast tray and fresh towels. Tom even offered oatmeal and fruits in the morning!

The neighborhood is quiet and safe, with ample of street parking space. It's at the perfect location for visiting Seattle. We would definitely stay here the next time we come back. "

The house is immaculately clean and the bedroom was very nice with the most comfortable bed I've slept on. In the morning there was even coffee, fruit and oatmeal. You can't really ask for much more from an airbnb experience. Thanks Tom!"
533443,19436085,2014-09-12,8074321,Jane,"I enjoyed my stay here. Tom's house is absolutely charming, very clean and comfortable.  Tom made sure I had everything I needed. He himself is a scream making me laugh and we had some good chats over morning coffee. Of course not to mention the star of the place, Max the dog who is simply adorable. The place is well located with ample street parking and accessible to downtown 20 mins by car or bus literally around the corner will take you there in about 30mins. I recommend Max's Hideaway for a stay in Seattle."

533443,20937412,2014-10-07,16794795,Alexandra,My Mom and I just spent a lovely night at Tom and Max's place. The house was extremely clean and the bed very comfortable. Tom was a gracious host and was always available for us if we needed him. There was adequate parking outside and it was quite close to the city. But our favourite part was of course Max! He was the nicest dog we've ever met. You will not regret a visit with either of these great guys!
533443,20981859,2014-10-08,49887,Linsi,Tom's place was great - super clean and welcoming. We were only there briefly but felt right at home. Oh! And Max is the sweetest dog ever :) 
533443,21237360,2014-10-13,21735025,Yue,"My boyfriend and I were traveling to Seattle for a wedding and stayed 3 nights at Tom and Max's home.  This was our first Airbnb experience so we were initially a little nervous.  Tom's prompt response to my emails and sense of humor put me at ease and we decided to book with him.  He wasn't home when we arrived so we were greeted by the adorable and sweet Max.  Tom is exceptionally warm, easy to talk to and a great host.  We ended up talking to him for over an hour our first night there as we all got back around the same time.  He even offered us a glass of wine to unwind!  The place is clean, comfortable and everything we needed.  Plus, having such a great dog around just made it that much better.  If only every dog was like Max!  Thank you again and we would definitely book with Tom again if we were to return to Seattle.  "
533443,21447100,2014-10-17,22380036,Chris,"Tom made my first visit to Seattle most pleasant. Max's Hideaway is indeed a perfect spot off the beaten path in a quiet neighborhood & convenient to downtown. I highly recommend this location, especially for you first timers."

Tom is very friendly and left us a tray of oatmeal and coffee supplies for the morning. We had a wonderful sleep as the bed is extremely comfortable. Great place to stay for a night or two!! Thanks Tom
Oh yeah- Max the dog is amazing. "
533443,22051296,2014-10-28,22858431,Jeffrey  W,"A restful and peaceful night. The bed is most comfortable! I slept longer that usual because of the comfort. Tom is relaxed and very welcoming. I appreciated his easy manner and he has a lovely dog in the house. I had to rush out early, but he left me the makings for a continental breakfast. 
The location is handy for me, near to my surgeon's office and clinic. I plan to return!"
533443,22176207,2014-10-31,3827029,David,"I enjoyed my stay at Tom's place very much.  From arrival to departure, Tom made my stay really convenient and comfortable.  The whole house is immaculately clean and tidy.  The private room was very cozy and the bed was so comfortable that I overslept by two hours.  Towels and a breakfast tray were neatly laid out on the queen size bed.  Max the dog is well behaved and friendly.  As a guest, I couldn't have asked for more."
533443,22232000,2014-11-02,20364738,Mike,This is my first time using airbnb.  Staying at max's hideout felt like home.  The house was really clean and easy to find due the the bright red chairs on his porch.  If you are a dog lover come check this place out.  Max is super friendly and playful!
533443,22421238,2014-11-05,17969594,Christina,"Our visit to Max's West Seattle Hideaway was brief, but both Tom and Max made us feel very welcome. Tom waited up for our later than planned arrival, and his place was warm and welcoming. 
We left early the next morning to continue our travels so we did not have time to visit with Tom (or even have the coffee, tea and snacks that were in our room upon arrival) but I would recommend this spot- especially if you are flying in late as it is an easy trip from the airport. "
533443,22478757,2014-11-07,9524486,Phil,Tom was a great host. We were always kept up to date on our reservation and he communicated often when he had to go to work around the time we were to arrive. Very nice room in a small house kept amazingly clean. He provided us a nice breakfast as well. Dog Max is cool

His dog, Max, is probably the most laid back dog I've ever met. The house is spotless, as is the room which has a huge, comfortable bed. The shower has a great pressure and is very warm. Tom let me use the kitchen and provided me with coffee, fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal. His house is in a low-key part of West Seattle, with quick access to downtown if you're in town visiting. I'd highly recommend Tom's bnb to anyone who wants to get a great value for their money. "
533443,24088808,2014-12-19,24367333,Eustia,"My husband and I had a very pleasant stay at Max's West Seattle Hideaway. This is a very accurate listing. The place looks exactly like the photos online.

The house was super clean and organized just like in the photos.

The dog was very friendly and I didn't even notice he was there while on the room. Highly recommended!

Although my wife and I were only in town for one night and unfortunately weren't able to meet Tom during our stay, his home was extremely clean and he made it easy for us to feel at home. We did however meet his extremely nice and friendly dog Max. What a great companion! When I woke up the morning after our stay, Max got out of his cozy living room bed to wander into our bedroom to say hello and made himself a nice little spot on the floor to lay down and keep us company as we were preparing to leave. Tom's home was an easy 15-20 minute drive max into beautiful downtown Seattle and only 5-10 minutes from AMAZING views of the mountains to the West of the city. It really is an ideal place to stay if you want to enjoy the comforts of Seattle but also a quick drive to all the area's attractions. Tom house was perfect and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling or staying in the area. "
533443,31139887,2015-05-02,25066926,Brian,Seattle was a fun city with a lot of energy. We were also able to go on some scenic hikes not to far from the city!

Beautiful home and Tom made sure we had access to anything we needed!  I'm sure sharing his bathroom with 2 girls isn't fun but I appreciate him sharing his home with us!  Definitely a great experience and a great host.

533443,35528820,2015-06-19,34822308,Ashley,"Tom's directions were very easy to follow when we arrived at his house since he was at work. His house was very clean. His dog, Max, was so kind. The room was comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay. Great experience!"
533443,35620760,2015-06-20,36002675,Naomi,"Our 1 night stay was wonderful! The house is very cozy, clean, and welcoming. The bed is extremely comfortable! Max is the sweetest dog & very chill! Tom is an excellent host, easy to contact, and very accommodating. We would love to stay there again. "
533443,35771938,2015-06-22,28336297,Lauren,Tom' place was great...exactly as in the pictures and as described. Everything was very clean and tidy. We only stayed 2 nights and didn't spend much time in the house or with Tom but when we did he was very welcoming and friendly. And Max...The most beautiful dog...It was great to come home to a big snuggle with him.
533443,37848210,2015-07-11,26692507,Serkan,"We had a wonderful time with Max and Tom. 
The communication was from the beginning perfect. When we arrived there, we got a lovely welcoming and great variety of recommendations about Seattle. 
The house is like the picture shows. The most comfortable bed we have ever slept in an Airbnb. The house is small but beautiful decorated with lovely details and very clean!! 
We enjoyed every breakfast on the beautiful patio. The bus station is just two minutes from the house and drives directly downtown. 

Max is a great dog and we had a lot of fun with both of them. 

We would love to see them again. 
"
533443,40900516,2015-08-03,32150511,Stacy,"Tom and Max were awesome! Very, very clean space. Nice, quite neighborhood. Average Uber or Lyft wait was 5 minutes or less and averaged less than $10 around West Seattle and $15 or less downtown. Didn't realize it was a shared bathroom but it wasn't a problem at all.  "
533443,41504450,2015-08-07,36639376,Becky,"Tom was an amazing host, he made sure we had everything we needed, knew where everything was and gave us great tips for things to do! He also provided breakfast which was a great touch. We didn't see him much but he always responded quickly to any questions we had. The most comfy bed we have ever slept in!!!! "
533443,42730766,2015-08-15,38874665,Andrea,"Tom was welcoming and a nice guy! Listing is accurate, place is suuuuuuper clean, and his dog Max is the best. Neighborhood is nice and quiet and not that far from downtown Seattle and surrounding areas, though it might seem like it it's far on a map. Overall, great place to stay. Bed is definitely as comfortable as everyone claims, if not more comfortable. Definitely take all of our words for it."
533443,43650894,2015-08-21,23641084,Zihua,"I had a great at Tom's house. His dog is very friendly. His house is very comfortable and clean, everything is organized. I would like to stay in his house again. "
533443,43886079,2015-08-22,2437147,Nobu,"Tom and Max were such welcoming and very kind hosts! We are now at the Endolyne restaurant, where Tom had recommended us to go for brunch and sipping the delicious Bloody Mary. Very nice neighborhood in West Seattle, so calm & peaceful. Great comfy bed. We very much enjoyed the stay here and would highly recommend Tom and Max's sweet bungalow for s chill, relaxin time in Seattle."
533443,44443022,2015-08-26,11851295,Emily,Tom and Max made wonderful hosts during our 4 day vacation in Seattle. The  Craftsman style home was very clean and cute and welcoming. We even had coffee and breakfast set on a tray every morning!  Tom offered suggestions on where to go and he was both helpful and friendly. I would recommend his home to anyone who wants to feel like they are at home on vacation. Thanks Tom! 
533443,44618948,2015-08-27,19706013,Matthew,"Tom was very helpful in planning our night in west Seattle, his house was super clean and his dog was friendly."
533443,44709374,2015-08-28,12277155,Luke,"We loved staying at Tom's house! He was very friendly, organized, and hospitable. He provided a great breakfast and interesting conversation. His house is remarkably well put-together; every last detail has been thought out. The guest bed is noticeably comfortable. His dog, Max, is perhaps the friendliest dog we've seen. We were very impressed. We'll be back!"
533443,44819681,2015-08-29,23124697,Chris-Chatt,"Tom's place was what my wife needed after a long tiring day walking around Seattle. It is a quiet, clean, comfortable home that is close enough to all the action but far from the hustle and bustle of a metropolis. Max was the sweetest dog! Tom is a cool customer and is a very gracious host. I'd recommend this place to anyone and i'd definitely stay here again."
533443,44941405,2015-08-30,38286445,Melissa,"Tom was a wonderful host. The accommodations were exactly as described and was very neat/clean. Tom was there when I arrived but had also given instructions in case he was not. Tom was very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions on where to grab dinner. The bed was comfortable and the house was quiet, meaning I was able to get a great sleep after a long day. 

As a bonus, Max is a sweetheart of a dog :) I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Seattle again."
533443,45334901,2015-09-01,178509,Marie,"Though we only stayed one night, Tom made us feel really welcome. We selected Tom's beautiful house because of the convenient location near the airport (around 15-20minutes) and also to try and see another Seattle neighborhood before traveling home. Tom was sensitive to the fact that we had an early flight and offered our yogurt to go, which I found really thoughtful. The neighborhood is quiet and mostly residential, so for dinner, we drove a short distance and discovered some great shops and restaurants on California Ave. I'd stay at Tom's again, if only to hang out with Max a bit longer!"
533443,45517026,2015-09-03,16108257,Christine,"Can't beat this price for a comfortable, clean, cozy, safe place to stay. We were just in and out and ended up sleeping for the majority of our stay, but we were happy to find this spot. Max the dog is so sweet and adorable (doesn't bark at all and lets you pet him!) and the bed was amazingly comfortable. Tom was very accommodating about my request to check in early and we were happy to find that his house was a very easy drive from downtown where we were sightseeing. The street was also very safe with plenty of parking spaces available (no meters or anything like that). Tom also recommended a few seafood restaurants in the area including Duke's which we would like to try next time we are in Seattle. Tom also had oatmeal, coffee and fruit available for our breakfast, but we had plans to visit the Starbucks roastery (great place to check out!). He also was kind enough to let us put our produce from the Pike Place Market in his fridge. Definitely recommend staying here. "
533443,45599170,2015-09-04,29468683,Paige,"Tom and Max (his dog) were there to greet us when we arrived and they had a nice warm bed for us and some breakfast for in the morning. It was the perfect place to crash on our trip towards Portland. Tom and Max were a warm, welcoming and friendly. We only wish we didn't have to leave so early so that we could have said good bye. Thank you again for having us over! "
533443,46109434,2015-09-07,43344159,Brittany,"Tom is a very nice gentleman! As is his companion Max (the sweetest dog ever!) Tom made my bf and I very welcome. His house is very comfortable, homey, and clean! He is very hospitable- providing breakfast, coffee, and tea!  I would definitely stay there again!"
533443,47594291,2015-09-20,44373055,Rexton,"Truly the best first-time Airbnb experience. The house and room were as warm and welcoming as they appear in the photos.  The check-in process was simple and straightforward.  Any questions I may have had, Tom circumvented by providing ample information about the place.  The room was extremely comfortable, and the coffee and oatmeal provided by Tom really made a guy feel welcome.  The kitchen and bathroom were also very nice and easy to navigate.  

On top of all of that, Tom himself was the nicest guy and even provided me information about local spots for some of my needs.  I was never afraid to ask him any questions, and, in fact, we had some fairly nice conversations.

Last but not least, I can't forget Max.  This lovable creature had me wrapped around his finger in no time.

Overall an excellent place to stay.  I would stay here again."
533443,47930694,2015-09-21,10338504,Julie,I didn't actually meet Tom because  of our schedules but he was great at communicating. His house was easy to find and has parking. Tom's place is in a nice quiet neighborhood and the house was nice and clean.
533443,48661733,2015-09-27,35633013,Zhou,"We feel very comfortable when living in Tom's house for two nights. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood , and has free parking lots.The house is super clean, and more importantly Max, the sweetest dog, my daughter and I like so much and he is really a good boy. Tom is warm and nice and he gave us some advice for shopping. We definitely recommend Living in Rom's house in Seattle. "
533443,49273375,2015-10-02,40234810,Nancy,Tom made my first Airbnb experience completely smooth and comfortable.  His hosting exprience is evident in all details.
533443,49580684,2015-10-04,19520240,Danni,"Tom is so great! He took us in on less than a day's notice, has a super sweet little space in an equally sweet neighborhood, was kind and friendly, made sure to give us tips about what to do in the city, and has the cutest floppy-eared pup, ever! Would totally stay again."
533443,50574032,2015-10-12,22208405,Jennifer,"People were NOT LYING!! Max (Tom's dog) was the most lovable pup on the planet. The bed was comfy, and his hospitality was awesome!! A little drive from downtown but not bad at all. I would absolutely recommend staying with Tom and Max! "
533443,50951820,2015-10-16,40234810,Nancy,My second stay at Max's hideaway was every bit as enjoyable as the first and Tom was able to pick me up at the airport even though my flight was later than expected.  Super supportive to this tired traveler returning home to Seattle!
533443,51220279,2015-10-18,8619587,Ross,"Tom was great, but the start of the show here really is Max. If you're a dog person, stay here! He's absolutely wonderful, and a total cuddlebug. 

As for the actual stay - Tom's house is adorable, spotlessly clean, and communication was an absolute snap. Would absolutely stay again."
533443,52274520,2015-10-27,1661268,Héctor,"Coordinating with Tom was easy. The room was impeccably clean. He facilitated plenty of clean towels and a breakfast tray. The room has a large dresser and plenty of space, a comfy bed, closet, and heater.    The neighborhood was nice and safe, with trees and parking. I had access to the kitchen and everything is pretty new. The house has been renovated recently. The dog, Max, is the most tranquil dog ever. "
533443,52767382,2015-11-01,47094495,Michael,"The stay was everything people had said in the comments!
Very nice host, incredibly cute and quiet dog :)

Pretty easy and relatively fast to go to downtown from there, I'd do it again without a single hesitation!

533443,56701256,2015-12-16,40234810,Nancy,"Tom creates a seamless, welcoming Airbnb experience.  Everything is exactly as pictured and super clean, which should be standard yet some Airbnb hosts let this slide.  Not Tom.  He 'gets it'.  That's why this was my third stay at Max's West Seattle Hideaway."

9347157,55693973,2015-12-04,49873978,Jc,"Amiee is a great no pressure host. I appreciated her bedside welcoming gift, her 2 greeter cats and some light conversation.

I was in Seattle for classes at the harbor. I feel lucky her place was only a few blocks away from my venue.

Amiee's 1950's style apartment is perfect for the solo female traveler. I found a well lit entry, bus stop nearby and a spotless bathroom.  I have acute hearing and  found the bedroom very quiet. I could hear the rumble of the city like a light ceiling fan, so no problem there. The bed was super comfortable. I also had use of the kitchen, and enjoyed the view from the front room.

I absolutely recommend Amiee for continued hosting, and look forward to my next stay with her.

Even though there were lots of awesome landscapes in Seattle, we had not wanted  to go outside and to stay more longer than our plan!
We loved like that. We'd like to visit again and are satisfied with host's service and resonable rental fee."
